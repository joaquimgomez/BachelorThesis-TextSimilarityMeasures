Abstract 
 

The analysis of asymmetries in the price transmission mechanism at different 
levels of the marketing chain provides a good indicator of market efficiency in 
vertically related markets.  The objective of this paper is to investigate the non-linear 
adjustments of prices in the poultry marketing chain in Spain. The methodology used is 
based on the multivariate approach to specify and estimate a Threshold Autoregressive 
Model. Price relationships at feed industry, producer and retail levels are considered. 
Results indicate that, in the long run, price transmission is perfect and any supply or 
demand shocks are fully transmitted to all prices in the system. In the short run, price 
adjustments between the feed and the farmer levels are fairly symmetric and are 
representative of a cost-push transmission mechanism. On the other hand, retailers 
benefit from any shock, whether positive or negative, that affects supply or demand 
conditions when price spreads are increasing, while price behaviour is closely related to 
competitive markets when faced with declining price spreads.

1. Introduction 

Vertical integration is becoming one of the most important structural 

characteristics of agricultural markets. Economic theory suggests three main 

motivations for tighter vertical coordination linkages (Lawerence et al., 1997): risk 

reduction, market imperfections, and the implementation of non-competitive strategies 

(barriers to entry, price discrimination, etc.). However, no consensus exists about the 

effects on social welfare. While limiting the access of competitors to input sources and 

product outlets is viewed as an adverse consequence, gains in efficiency may be 

achieved that offset those negative effects. 

 Something similar happens when analysing the consequences of vertical 

integration on price transmission, which has been one of the main research interests 

among agricultural economists, given that such relationships are a good indicator of 

market efficiency. Some authors suggest that vertical coordination contributes to a rapid 

adjustment, according to short-run goals. Thus, cost increases are immediately 

transferred to the final output price. Others think that, in these markets, firms fix long-

run goals. Therefore, the adjustment process takes longer.  

 In any case, there is a common feeling that retail prices do not react very quickly 

to changes in market conditions (Borenstein et al., 1997; Peltzman, 2000). In this 

situation the retail price will not be equal to the marketing clearing price and, therefore, 

will generate an excess supply. Consequently, consumers will not benefit from 

declining farm prices which suggests a redistribution of consumer welfare.  

 Potential explanations for these asymmetric price relationships are market power 

at the retail level1 (Boyd and Brorsen, 1988; Bailey and Brorsen, 1989; Griffith and 

Piggott, 1994; Borestein et al.,1997; and Bettendorf and Verboven, 2000; among 

others), adjustment costs (Blinder et al., 1998; Buckle and Carlson, 2000; and Chavas 

and Mehta, 2002), differences in cost shares and input substitution possibilities 

(Bettendorf and Verboven, 2000), inventory holding (Reagan and Witzman, 1982); 

                                                 
1 Although asymmetries have been linked to non-competitive behaviour, this is not necessarily true. 
McCorriston et al. (2001), with formal grounding in rational firm conduct, showed that in presence of 
market power price changes could be greater or less than the competitive benchmark case depending on 
the interaction between such market power and returns to scale. In a similar way, although using an 
alternative theoretical approach, Azzam (1999) showed that, in a context of two-period model of spatially 
competitive retailers, asymmetries will be generated provided that spatially competitors face concave 
spatial demand functions.

asymmetric information (Bailey and Brorsen (1989), and public intervention (Kinnucan 

and Forker, 1987). In any case, as there are many possible reasons why price 

relationships along the food chain may be asymmetric, before explanations can be given 

for specific markets, the first step is to analyse the existence of such asymmetric price 

adjustments. 

In this paper we investigate the price transmission mechanism in the Spanish 

poultry marketing chain. Particularly, we will focus our study on answering the question 

of whether Spanish poultry farmers benefit or not from unanticipated positive and 

negative supply or demand shocks. Poultry has been one of the agricultural sectors 

where vertical coordination practices have developed earlier and more intensively. The 

high dependence of poultry production on feed has led to different kinds of coordination 

between the different stages of meat production, ranging from contracts to vertical 

integration. Nowadays, almost 95% of the poultry production in Spain is carried out 

under some type of vertical integration or coordination, and so it is a good example for 

analysing price behaviour in vertically related markets. 

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 the main 

characteristics of the Spanish poultry sector are described. Section 3 provides a 

description of the methodological approach used in the paper. Section 4 reports our 

empirical results. Finally, Section 5 closes the paper with some concluding remarks. 

 

2. Relevant features of the Spanish poultry sector 

 The poultry sector in Spain accounts for 5% of the Final Agricultural Output, 

20% of the total meat production and 14% of the total European Union (EU) poultry 

production. Furthermore, it is the second main supplier for the meat processing industry 

after pork. Together, these constitute the most important components of the Spanish 

agro-food industry in terms of production and employment. In 2000, it accounted for 

20% of the total agro-food industry output. 

 Poultry is also a key agricultural sector because of its close links with the grain 

and feed sectors. In contrast to the Northern European countries, and in spite of its 

decreasing use, cereal still constitutes the main raw material in feed composition.  This 

can be explained by the distance to the most important harbours in Europe, through 



 4 

which cereal substitute products are imported, and by the existing surpluses in cereal 

production (mainly barley). 

 The animal feed industry is the third most relevant component in the Spanish 

agro-food industry, representing around 10% of the total output. Moreover, 25% of the 

quantity produced is destined to the poultry sector. However, only 5% of the poultry-

feed production is marketed in a “free market”. In other words, 95% of feed is destined 

to the “cautive” market, constituted by poultry farms, which are linked to the feed 

industry through some kind of vertical coordination. 

 Poultry and pork have been two of the agricultural sectors where vertical 

coordination practices have developed earlier and more intensively. The high 

dependence of poultry production on feed has led to different kinds of coordination 

between both stages of meat production, ranging from contracts to vertical integration. 

Thus both benefit from a risk reduction. Nowadays, vertical arrangements have spread 

to the meat industry and, in some cases, to the retail sector. 

Taking into account the objective of this paper, the most relevant information is 

provided by the evolution of different prices in the Spanish poultry chain. Figure 1 

shows the evolution of monthly feed (FP), producer (PP) and retail (RP) price indexes 

(1980=100) during the period 1980-2001. Feed and producer prices are taken directly 

from publications of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (MAPA). 

Retail prices are taken from the Boletín Económico del ICE (Ministry of Finance). 

(Insert Figure 1 about here) 

As can be observed, the three prices show a similar pattern during the whole 

period although more volatility is observed after Spain’s joining the EU, mainly at 

producer and retail levels. Marketing margins at the retail level have increased during 

the last decade. Furthermore, it is important to note that the retail price tends to react 

slightly later than the other two prices when facing changing market conditions.  

 

3. Methodology 

Using somevariations of a model first developed by Wolframm (1971) and later 

modified by Houck (1977), most authors have found evidence of both asymmetries in 



 5 

price adjustments and a cost-push price transmission mechanism for different products2 

(see, for instance, Ward, 1982; Kinnucan and Forker, 1987; Hahn, 1990; and Hansmire 

and Willett, 1992; Griffith and Piggott, 1994; among others). More recently, Pelztman 

(2000), in an exhaustive paper, found that retail prices tended to rise faster than they fell 

suggesting a revision of the traditional economic theory of markets. 

However, results from the empirical models utilised by the above authors to 

investigate asymmetriesc in price transmission have to be interpreted with caution, as 

they have not adequately consideredl the time series properties of the data. Von 

Cramon-Taubadel (1998) showed that the traditional econometric specification used to 

test for asymmetric price transmission is inconsistent with cointegration. He proposed 

an alternative specification of the Wolffram-Houck model based on the error correction 

representation and taking into account the procedure approach suggested by Granger 

and Lee (1989).  

A second limitation is that, generally, it is assumed that the underlying price 

transmission mechanism is linear. However, the presence of fixed costs of adjustment in 

the food chain may generate non-linear reactions, that is to say, price adjustments may 

be different depending both on the magnitude and the sign of the initial shock. In other 

words, it is not unrealistic to suppose that only when the initial shock surpasses the 

critical threshold do economic agents react to it. If this is the case, then threshold 

models of dynamic economic equilibrium are more appropriate when analysing 

dynamic price relationships between markets in the food chain.  

In this paper, we apply the methodological approach suggested by Hansen and 

Seo (2001), which has already been applied for spatially separated markets by Goodwin 

and Piggott (2001) and Lo and Zivot (2001). More precisely, we have initially specified 

a three-regime Threshold Vector Autoregression model (TVECM3) to analyse the price 

transmission mechanism in the Spanish poultry sector.  

3.1 Threshold cointegration  

 Let Pt=(P1t,P2t)’ be the log price of a good at two different levels of the 

marketing channel, assuming that Pt is a vector of I(1) time series which is cointegrated 

                                                 
2 The only exception is Boyd and Brorsen (1988), who do not find asymmetric price relationships in the US 
pork sector.

where 1tt P)( −β′=βω  is the cointegrating vector evaluated at the generic value β=(1,-

β2)’; Γi, i= 1, 2… are (2×2) matrices of short-run parameters; α is a (2×2) matrix; and εt 

is a vector of error terms that are assumed to be independently and identically Gaussian 

distributed with a covariance matrix Σ which is assumed to be positive definite. β is the 

cointegrating vector which is commonly interpreted as the long-run equilibrium relation 

between the two prices in Pt , while α gives the weights of the cointegration relationship 

in the VECM equations.  

 Following Lo and Zivot (2001), a three-regime threshold Vector Error 

Correction Model (TVECM3), can be written as:

where λ=( ( )21 λλ  are the threshold parameters that delineate the different regimes.  

 As can be observed, the TVECM3 in (2) specifies that the adjustment towards the 

long-run equilibrium relationship [ 1tt P)( −β′=βω ] is regime-specific. This model says 

that the dynamic adjustment of Pit depends on the magnitude of 1tt P)( −β′=βω .  

A special case of the TVECM given in (2) occurs if price changes are smaller 

than transaction costs. In this case, prices will not adjust in the second regime (in the 

middle one) implying that prices are not cointegreted, that is, α2=0 and µ2 =0. The 

resulting model is the so-called Band-TVECM. If 1tt P)( −β′=βω  is within the band, then 

prices are not cointegrated and Pt follows a VAR(k) without a drift. However, in the 

outer bands economic forces push prices moving together implying cointegration with 

different adjustment coefficients. If )(t βω  >λ
2 ( )(t βω  <λ

1), then the cointegrating 



 7 

vector reverts to the regime-specific mean with an adjustment coefficient3 ρ3 (ρ1) while 

tP∆  adjusts to the long-run equilibrium with a speed of adjustment vector α
3 (α1).  

Note that when the threshold parameters (λ1 and λ2) are both fixed (known a 

priori), the model is linear in the remaining parameters. In such circumstances, and 

under the assumption that errors εt are iid gaussian, parameters in model (2) can be 

estimated by multivariate least squares. However, in general, the threshold parameters 

(λi’s) are unknown and need to be estimated along with the remaining parameters of the 

model. Lo and Zivot (2001) propose a strategy which combines Hansen’s (1999) 

approach to estimate two- and three-regime univariate TAR models and Tsay‘s (1998) 

procedure to estimate multivariate TVECM. 

In the first step, the threshold parameters can be estimated through the following

where

and ( )λβ,Σ̂  is the estimated covariance matrix of model (2) conditional on (λ). 

The second step consists of testing if the dynamic behaviour and the adjustment 

towards the long-run equilibrium relationship is linear or exhibits threshold non-

linearity using the sup-LR statistic proposed by Lo and Zivot (2001): 

( )),(ˆlnˆln 2113 λλΣ−Σ= TLR        (4) 
where Σ̂  and ),(ˆ 21 λλΣ are the residual covariance matrices of the VECM and TVECM, 

respectively.

4 The grid search minimizes the log determinant of the residual covariance matrix of the TVECM, which is 
analogous to maximizing a standard LR test. This criterion differs from the approach used in other empirical 
analyses (Goodwin and Holt, 1999 and Goodwin and Piggott, 20001) in that it does not assume cross-
equation independence between the residuals. 



 8 

Once non cointegration and linearity have been rejected, there are several 

questions that have to be answered in the empirical analysis before allowing the 

researcher to interpret results. The most important, without doubt, is to determine which 

kind of threshold model is more appropriate for the data (number of regimes, the 

TVECM or the Band-TVECM, and a symmetric or asymmetric threshold model). This 

issue will be properly addressed in the empirical analysis.  

4.2 Non-linear impulse response functions 

 Once the TVECM has been estimated, it is useful to analyse the short-run 

dynamic behaviour of the variables by computing the impulse response functions. This 

can be particularly suitable for studying the time path response of variables to 

unexpected shocks at time t. However, given that the non-linear time series model does 

not have a Wald representation, computing the IRF for these types of models is not an 

easy task. In addition, as discussed in Koop et al. (1996), the complications arise 

because in non-linear models5: i) the effect of a shock depends on the history of the time 

series up to the point where the shock occurs; and ii) the effect of a shock depends on 

the sign and the size of the shock. As a consequence, in non-linear models impulse 

response functions depend on the combined magnitude of the history Pt-1=ωt-1 and the 

magnitude of the shock δ (relative to the threshold value λ) 

 The Generalised Impulse Response Functions (GIRF) introduced by Koop et al. 

(1996) and Potter (1995) offer a useful generalisation of the concept of impulse 

responses to non-linear models. Their analysis focused on the asymmetric response of 

the variables to one standard deviation of both positive and negative shocks.  The Non-

linear Impulse Response Functions (NIRF) are defined in a similar manner to traditional 

GIRF, except for replacing the standard linear predictor by a conditional expectation. 

Hence, the NIRF for a specific shock δ=εt  and history Pt-1=ϕt-1  (the history of the 

system) is defined as: 

[ ]

 Taking into account this definition, it is clear that the NIRF is a function of δ∈εt 

and ϕt-1∈Ωt-1 (Ωt-1 is the history or information set at t-1 used to forecast future values 
                                                 
5  In the linear model, IRF are symmetric, in the sense that a shock of size -δ has exactly the opposite effect to 
that of a shock of size δ.

al. (1996) stress that NIRF themselves are realisations of random variables given by:

4. Empirical analysis 

 4.1. Data and preliminary analysis 

In this section we perform the multivariate threshold cointegration approach 

described above to analyse the price transmission mechanism in the Spanish poultry 

sector. The methodological approach consists of the following steps. After testing for 

unit roots, we test for cointegration using the Johansen (1988) procedure. Second, 

taking into account the results from the previous step, several restrictions are imposed 

on the cointegrating vector in order to test for long-run price homogeneity. If 

cointegration is found, the next step consists of determining whether the dynamics of 

the data can be described by threshold-type non-linearities. Finally, if the price 

transmission mechanism follows a threshold error correction model (TVECM), then 

non-linear Generalised Impulse Response functions are calculated in order to analyse 

the response of each price to unanticipated positive and negative shocks.  

The data used have been described in Section 2. All variables are expressed in 

natural logarithms. Before implementing the Johansen and Juselius’ procedure for the 

cointegration analysis among the price series, we first examine their stochastic time 

series properties. Due to the monthly frequency of data, seasonality is investigated by 

implementing seasonal unit root tests following the procedure developed by Franses 

(1991). As can be observed in Table 1, results from the seasonal unit root tests clearly 

indicate that the three price series are stationary. Moreover, seasonal dummy variables 

were not significant indicating that neither a deterministic nor a stochastic seasonal 

component was present. Only the null of the unit root at the regular frequency (π1=0) 

cannot be rejected. However, the tests presented are not very powerful if seasonal components 

are not present and traditional unit root tests should be implemented.  

(Insert Table 1 about here) 

However, a second problem arises when examining Figure 1, as price series 

exhibit a changing trend around 1985-86, that is, when Spain joined the EU. In this 



 10

case, the distribution of traditional statistics to test for unit roots change (Perron, 1989 

and Rappoport and Reichlin, 1989) and auxiliary regressions must incorporate the 

structural change (Perron, 1989 and Banerjee et al., 1992). Unit root tests with structural 

breaks are conducted for each price series. Table 2 shows the main results. In the three 

price series the null of non- stationarity cannot be rejected indicating that all price series 

are I(1). 

(Insert Table 2 about here) 

4.2.Cointegration analysis 

In this section we address the first step to specify a TVECM (i.e. testing for 

cointegration and estimating the cointegrating relationship). The Johansen procedure is 

used to test for cointegration among the time series. Escribano and Mira (1996) and van 

Dijk and Franses (1997) show that the cointegrating vector can still be estimated 

superconsistently in the presence of neglected non-linearity in the adjustment process. 

Nevertheless, given that the TVECM3 defined in (2) is bivariate with only one 

cointegrating vector, the analysis has been carried out considering two separate 

subsystems. The first one considers the relationship between the feed price (FP) and the 

producer price (PP), while the second analyses the relationship between the producer 

price (PP) and the retail price (RP). 

However, the presentation of the data in the previous section has revealed that 

the single series may be characterized by a broken linear trend due to the Spain’s 

integration into the EU. These deterministic components may affect log-price 

differences and have to be included in the price relationships in order to obtain 

stationarity. So, to test for cointegration we have used a generalization of the 

multivariate Johansen testing procedure proposed by Johansen et al. (2000), which 

allows for broken linear trend levels. 

Assuming one break in the deterministic components (intercept and trend) at 

time t=T1, Johansen’s procedure is based on the definition of a p-dimensional VAR 

model of k-th order in the form of a vector error correction model (VECM) which, in 

matrix form, can be expressed as:

where Zt is the vector (px1) of price series being considered, ∆Zt=Zt-Zt-1; D1,t is a 

dummy variable which takes the value one for t<T1 and zero otherwise, D2,t=1-D1; Γi 

are matrices (pxp) of short-run parameters (i=1,.., k-1); φ1, φ2, µ1, and µ2 are (px1) 

parameter vectors related to the linear trends and intercepts of the two regimes, and 

εt∼N(0,Σ) . 

The Johansen procedure tests the rank r of the matrix β′α=Π , where β is a 

matrix of long-run coefficients such that the (β'Zt-1) term represents the (r) cointegration 

relationships in the multivariate model which ensure that Zt converge to their long-run 

steady-state solutions, whilst the parameters of matrix α measure the speed of 

adjustment of the dependent variables to the long-run equilibria reflected in the term 

( tZβ′ ). Hence, the rank r determines the number of cointegration relationships between 

the p variables of the system (6). Johansen et al. (2000) proposed the trace statistic to 

test for the cointegration rank. Critical values for the asymptotic distribution of the test 

can be computed by using a response surface given in Johansen et al. (2000). 

The optimum lag of the VECM has been selected on the basis of the Akaike 

Information Criterion (AIC) and the Likelihood Ratio test proposed by Tiao and Box 

(1981). Both tests provide consistent results and indicate that both systems have to 

include five lags. Misspecification tests for autocorrelation and normality, described in 

Doornik and Hendry (1997), have been carried out for each system to check for the 

statistical adequacy of the model. Results indicate that the models specified above are 

quite satisfactory.  

Table 3 (first row) shows the results from the cointegration tests. At the 5% level 

of significance, the trace statistic indicates that the null hypothesis of one cointegrating 

vector cannot be rejected in either system. Given that the cointegrating rank is one, we 

have tested whether the price transmission between feed and producer prices and 

between producer and retail prices is perfect in the long run. This hypothesis states that 

the cointegrating vector β in each system should satisfy the long-run price homogeneity 

condition (1,-1). All restriction tests on the cointegrating vector are asymptotically χ2(v) 

distributed where, v is the number of imposed restrictions6. Results from the Likelihood 

Ratio (LR) statistic (second row of Table 3) show that the homogeneity restriction

cannot be rejected and has empirical support. Consequently, it can be concluded that, in 

the long run, any change in any of the prices at different levels of the Spanish poultry 

marketing chain is fully transmitted to the rest.  

(Insert Table 3 about here) 

As far as the significance of the deterministic components included in the model 

concerned, Table 3 (third and fourth rows) shows that in both systems the trend 

coefficients are not significant at the 5% level of significance. As a consequence, linear 

trends can be completely excluded from the model, implying that intercepts can be 

restricted to the cointegrating space (as Table 3 shows, intercepts are significant). 

Finally, the restricted cointegrating vectors are given by (Table 3, fifth row): 

LnPP – lnFP =1.167D1t+1.070D2t      (7) 

LnRP – lnPP = 0.604D1t+0.792D2t      (8) 

The constant terms in (7) and (8) represent the price spread at the farm and retail 

levels, respectively. Taking into account that all prices are expressed in logarithms, (7) 

and (8) represent percentage spread models with a mark-up of (eα-1) (with α being the 

constant) (Tiffin and Dawson, 2000). Hence, the farm and retail marketing margins can 

be expressed as follows: 

Farm margin = (eα-1)×FP×100      (9) 

Retail margin = (eα-1)×WP×100        (10) 

 The corresponding values of marketing margins for the two sub-periods in which 

the sample has been divided (before and after Spain joining the EU) are shown in last 

row of Table 3. The farm margin has decreased by 10% as a consequence of increasing 

costs after joining the EU and the stabilisation of farm prices. However, the retail 

margin, as shown in Figure 1, has increased by 50%. 

4.3.Threshold cointegration 

 Once the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two pairs 

of prices has been detected, the next question is whether possible non-linearities exist in 

the adjustment process. We start by testing non-linearity and, if the null of linearity is 

rejected, by determining the number of regimes in each of the two TVECM specified 

for systems (FP-PP) and (PP-RP), respectively, considering the estimated cointegrating 

vectors, given in (7) and (8), as the respective threshold variables (ωt-1). The LR test for 



 13

linearity against a multivariate TVECM3 (LR1,3) is based on a VECM with 5 lags for 

systems (FP-PP) and (PP-RP), respectively. Results from LR1,3 linearity tests are shown 

in Table 4. In both systems, the null of linearity is rejected at the 5% level, in favour of 

the threshold model. 

(Insert Table 4 about here) 

Given that linearity is rejected in favour of threshold non-linearity, next we test 

which threshold model is more appropriate to characterize the non-linear dynamic 

adjustments of prices using the following Likelihood Ratio (LR) statistic (Lo and Zivot, 

2001):  

[ ] [ ]( ))ˆ(ˆln)ˆ(ˆln 323,2 λλ Σ−Σ= TLR        (7) 
where )ˆ(ˆ 2 λΣ  and )

ˆ(ˆ 3 λΣ  are the estimated residual covariance matrices from the 

unrestricted TVECM2 and TVECM3, respectively. The asymptotic distributions of LR2,3 

are non-standard and bootstrap methods can be used to compute approximate p-values. 

 As can be observed from Table 4, in both cases the LR statistic rejects the null of 

a TVECM2 against the alternative of a three-regime TVECM3, suggesting that price 

transmission in the Spanish poultry marketing chain can be characterised by a three-

regime threshold process. At the bottom of Table 4 the estimated threshold parameters 

from the TVECM3 are shown for both systems. 

The estimated TVECM3 coefficients are shown in Table 5 along with results 

from the misspecification tests. As can be observed, the results of the diagnostic tests 

suggest that the estimated models in both systems are adequate as there is no evidence 

for remaining residual autocorrelation, ARCH tests fail to reject the null of 

homocedasticity and, finally, normality cannot be rejected. Moreover, for both systems, 

the estimated parameters in the outer regimes are significant and have the expected sign. 

However, in the middle regime (regime 2) adjustment coefficients are not significant.  

(Insert Table 5 about here) 

Considering this result, the TVECM3 could be re-specified as a Band-TVECM 

as has been defined in Section 3.  A Wald test is carried out to check if the adjustment 

coefficients in the middle regime are jointly significant in both systems. Results indicate 

that, in both systems, the null of no significance cannot be rejected at the 5% 

significance level (the Wald statistic is 3.25 and 4.54 for systems FP-PP and PP-RP, 



 14

respectively, while the critical value is 5.99). Consequently, it can be concluded that 

Band-TVECM is more appropriate than the unrestricted TVECM to represent the 

asymmetric adjustments of poultry prices in the marketing channel. The first regime is 

associated with lower marketing margins while the third regime corresponds to periods 

with higher marketing margins in both systems.  

The estimated parameters of the Band-TVECM for the two systems are given in 

Table 6. Furthermore, we include the estimates of the adjustment parameters iρ̂ , which 

measure how the cointegrating vector reverts to the regime-specific mean (see footnote 

3). As can be observed, the estimated parameters iρ̂  in regime 1 are always lower than 

those in the upper regime. A smaller iρ̂  means that price adjustments after disequilibria 

are faster. In the lower regime ρ̂  is 0.403 for system (FP-PP) and 0.447 for system (PP-

RP) and increases to 0.773 and 0.48 for systems one and two, respectively. In other 

words, adjustments are faster when deviations from the long-run equilibrium are 

negative.  

(Insert Table 6 about here) 

The speed of adjustment is usually measured by the so-called half-life 

[ln(0.5)/ln( iρ̂ )] which states the number of periods required to reduce one-half of a 

deviation from the long-run equilibrium (Taylor, 2001). Taking into account the results 

mentioned in the above paragraph, the half-life increases from 0.76 and 0.85 weeks to 

2.69 and 0.94 weeks for system (FP-PP) and system (PP-RP), respectively. These 

results indicate that the adjustment induced by a negative deviation from the stationary 

price relationship is much faster than when it is induced by a positive deviation. 

In any case, as we have already mentioned in the previous section, the key 

feature in threshold models is the pattern of the estimated coefficients of the α matrix 

(αij) associated with the cointegrating vector in each regime. These coefficients can be 

useful to analyse which prices “equilibrium adjust” and which do not. Although these 

results will be better understood by computing the impulse response functions, which 

will be the aim of the next section, we will try to anticipate some of these results here. 

In the PP-RP subsystem, after a positive deviation from the long-run equilibrium 

(third regime), adjustment coefficients are significant, indicating a feedback effect 

between the two prices. In addition, estimated coefficients indicate that the speed of 



 15

adjustment of the retail prices is slower than that of the producer prices (the retail price 

adjusts by eliminating 14% of the positive impact generated in the previous period, 

while in the case of the producer price the adjustment is 35%). In the case of a negative 

deviation, this situation is reinforced as retail prices do not adjust to changes in the 

long-run equilibrium. These results indicate, consistent with previous literature, that 

retail prices are sticky relative to producer prices. 

In the (FP-PP) system, the results are fairly representative of vertically 

integrated markets. Positive shocks to the price spread generate a quicker adjustment of 

feed prices while they remain more rigid after negative shocks to the price spread. Thus, 

in both cases there is a quick adjustment to the long-run price spread equilibrium. 

4.4. Short-Run Dynamics 

Short-run dynamics have been analysed by computing the IRF, which show the 

response of each price in the system to a shock in any other price. In this study, non-

linear IRF (NIRF) have been calculated for both of the system for regimes 1 and 3. In a 

context of non-linear models, NIRF are very useful tools, as they allow us to 

differentiate responses to both positive and negative shocks. Moreover, the time at 

which the shock takes place is relevant and, thus, we could expect different responses 

depending on which of the regimes the shock is produced in.  

In order to analyse the asymmetric behaviour of price adjustments, the NIRF 

have been computed for δ=±1 and for history-specific regimes in which the long-run 

equilibrium relationship (i=1,2 for the first and second system, respectively) is above or 

below the upper and lower threshold values. Figures 2 and 3 show the NIRF for each 

system. In each regime, the NIRF for each forecasting horizon is the average across all 

possible Ni histories (with Ni being the number of observations in the i
th regime).  

Figure 2 shows the NIRF for the system (FP-PP) to 1% positive and negative 

shocks produced in both the first and the third regimes. Several implications for price 

relationships arise from it. As can be observed, responses to a shock in feed prices 

generate symmetric responses, that is, the effects of positive and negative shocks are 

more or less of the same magnitude. This symmetric behaviour is quite consistent with 

previous expectations as these two levels of the marketing chain are vertically 

integrated. Moreover, responses are similar in the two regimes. On the other hand, 



 16

producer prices are more flexible than feed prices in the short-run, increasing producer 

marketing margins as a consequence of cost-pushes.  

(Insert Figure 2 about here) 

A shock to the producer price does not generate any response in feed prices in 

either of the two regimes. This result clearly indicates the existence of a cost-push price 

transmission mechanism in the FP-PP system. Responses of producer prices are more 

persistent. An interesting result here in relation to the responses of producer prices is 

that, in the first regime (negative deviation from the long-run price spread), price 

adjustment is positive-asymmetric, that is, price increases are transmitted faster than 

price decreases. However, in the other regime (positive deviation from the long run 

price spread) the opposite occurs. These results indicate that in the Spanish poultry 

sector prices react quickly to changing conditions to reach long-run equilibrium 

immediately.  

Let us now consider the system (PP-RP) under the first regime, i.e. negative 

deviation to the long-run price spread equilibrium (Figure 3). In general terms, 

responses are fairly symmetric. A positive shock to the producer price squeezes the 

marketing margin. On the other hand, negative shocks generate increasing price spreads. 

This result shows a fairly competitive behaviour. This is not surprising, given the degree 

of vertical integration which makes firms work with cost functions characterised by 

increasing returns to scale. Under such circumstances, McCorriston et al., (2001) 

showed that the retailing market power could be offset. This situation is radically 

different to that existing in other meat markets, in which production is not so highly 

vertically and horizontally concentrated. Moreover, 1% positive or negative shocks to 

the retail price generate responses of lower magnitude than in the producer price, 

indicating, also at this level of the marketing chain, a cost-push transmission 

mechanism.  

(Insert Figure 3 about here) 

The situation changes in some way in the third regime, characterized by positive 

deviations of the long-run producer-retailer price spread. The price transmission 

mechanism holds, as responses to a shock in the producer price are of higher magnitude 

than in the case of a shock in the retail price. As can be observed in Figure 3, a positive 

shock in the producer price generates immediate responses of both prices of the same 



 17

magnitude keeping marketing margins constant. However, responses to negative shocks 

are very low, suggesting that positive shocks are more persistent and generate positive 

asymmetries.  

A 1% positive shock to the retail price generates an immediate and significant 

response of both prices. However, the magnitude of such responses is quite different. 

The wholesale price exhibits a certain delay in adjusting to the new situation, reaching 

the maximum response after three weeks. Thus, although in the long run both prices are 

homogeneous, in the very short-run retailers benefit from a demand shock as the price 

spread increases. In the case of a negative shock to the retail price, price spreads also 

increases and producer prices show more nominal price flexibility. As can be easily 

observed, under positive deviations from long-run price spreads, the magnitude of the 

asymmetric effect is greater in the case of the retail price, suggesting that inflation in 

poultry products is not exclusively generated by cost increases, but rather by a mixture 

of both cost and marketing margin increases.  

 

5. Conclusions 

This paper has explored the non-linearity in the price transmission mechanism in 

the Spanish poultry marketing chain, a sector characterized by a high degree of vertical 

integration and horizontal concentration. Two sub-systems have been studied: on one 

hand, the relationship between farm and feed prices and, on the other, the price 

relationship between the producer and the retail market levels.  The methodology used 

has been based on the specification and estimation of a three-regime TVECM. In both 

systems, price reactions in the intermediate regime are not significant, allowing us to 

specify a Band-TVECM. The results obtained suggest a number of points. 

In the long run, prices at different levels of the marketing chain are perfectly 

integrated, that is to say, any change in any of the prices is fully transmitted to the rest. 

However, in the short run, results are different depending on the system being analysed. 

Price adjustments between the farm and the feed levels are quite consistent with the 

existence of intensive vertical coordination between these two steps of the Spanish 

poultry marketing chain. Reactions of both prices to positive and negative shocks are 

symmetric and producer prices are more flexible witch suggests that there is a cost-push 

transmission mechanism.  



 18

The analysis of the price transmission mechanism between the producer and the 

retail levels offers a different picture and also depends on the specific regime in which 

the shock is generated. The main conclusion is that, in an environment of positive 

deviations from the long-run price spread, retailers benefit from any shock, whether 

positive or negative, that affects supply or demand conditions. In the first regime 

(negative deviations from long-run equilibrium), marketing margins tend to remain 

quite stabilised.  

The analysis has focused on vertical price adjustments in the Spanish poultry 

sector but it can be extended in several directions. First, a natural extension will be to 

investigate other meat sectors in Spain with different market structures (different 

degrees of market integration) or other food sectors with different characteristics 

(branded products, more processed products, non-perishable products, etc). From the 

methodological point of view further refinements could be used in the future as new 

theoretical econometric issues arise in the context of non-linear models in a multivariate 

framework.
