Table 1: Results from partial likelihood estimation for COX proportional Hazard model (processed meat agro-industry).












Table 2: Results from partial likelihood estimation for COX proportional Hazard model (wine agro-industry)












	In both sector, results demonstrates that  factors which increase the likelihood of exit are: leverage and positive extraordinary results as a results of disinvestment decisions.
	Factors that decrease the hazard of abandoning market are: age (Date of setting-up), Current Ratio, Technical Efficiency, firm size and Technical efficiency. However there are small difference between sectors.
	Dummy variables (2000 for meat and 1990 for wine are relevant in explaining the hazard of market exit as a result of  the PAC reforms and regulations.
	Results allow  policy makers to focus on agro-industries with higher hazard.

1. INTRODUCTION
	This Work focuses on assessing the determinants factors that drive agro-industries to abandon their activities as well the timing of their decision. Moreover, we analyze agro-industry exit and Technical  Efficiency.
	We analyze two different agro-industry sector in Catalonia (Spain); the wine and processed meat sectors.
	The selection of both sectors has been motivated by the strategic position they occupy within the Catalonian agro-industry sector:
	Both have a relevant economic function representing 43% of the total sales.
	The input-output tables show a strong interrelationship with other economic sectors. such as agricultural input suppliers (50% of total input), logistic, banking, technological, etc.
	They play an important social and territorial role employing the equivalent of 31,534 full-time workers, representing 42% of the labor force in the Catalonian agro-industry sector.
	Results allow policy makers to obtain information about agro-industries with high hazard to abandon market. Thus, decision could be taken to maintain the social fabric associated to these agro-industries.

	 Several factors can influence the decision to market exit and the likelihood of firm dissolution:
	Manager characteristics and risk behavior; Age, gender, education, experience, attitudes, risk aversion, etc.
	Firm characteristics; firm size (Capital, employee number), firm age, legal form, location,  etc.
	Firm management; number of brand, Total Assets Turnover, diversification of activities and products, economies of scale, Technical Efficiency, etc.
	Economic and financial results; profitability, leverage, solvency, current ratio,, etc.
	Exogenous factors: market size and concentration, industry growth, input prices, subsidies, information access, reforms, etc.

2. DETERMINANTS OF EXIT
3. METHODOLOGY
	First step we used the stochastic frontier methodology to measure firm’s technical efficiency. (TE)
	 Second step we  apply The Duration Analysis in order to determine not only why firms exit but also the timing of dissolution and the factors that influence the observed time patterns.

3.1. STOCHASTIC FRONTIER METHODOLOGY
	 The stochastic frontier production function can be expressed as follows:


	where  yit is the output of the i-th firm (i=1...N) in period (t=1...T), where f(xit,t,) represents the production technology, xit is a (1K) vector of inputs and other factors influencing production associated with the i-th firm in period t, and  is a (K1) vector of unknown parameters to be estimated.
	 Disturbance term is composed of two parts: vit and uit . The former captures the effects of statistical noise outside the firm's control. The latter is associated with output oriented technical inefficiencies.
	 The distributions of the two error terms are independent:



	Maximum likelihood techniques are used for estimation.



	 Duration Analysis (DA) models the time length of a spell or  “event”. The spell starts at the time of entry into a specific state  (entry decision) and ends at a point when a new state is entered (exit decision).
	The conceptual foundations of DA rely on probability theory. We define the hazard function that specifies the rate at which a spell is completed at time t=T , given it survives until time t . in our analysis, the hazard function represents the probability that a farmer exit at time t , given he has not adopted before t :




3.2 . DURATION ANALYSIS

	A set of explanatory variables of economic and non-economic nature influence and alter the distribution of the duration:



	where   is a vector of unknown parameters of x , the vector of explanatory variables and  is a vector of parameters that characterize the distribution function of the hazard rate.
	To estimate the duration model we use the semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model. Under this model the duration of each member of a population is assumed to follow its own hazard function:

	The estimation procedure is based on the partial likelihood function introduced by Cox (1972, 1975)


	




	 Data used in this analysis were obtained from the ‘Sistema Anual de Balances Ibéricos’ (SABI) database. The SABI collects extensive economic and non economic information on the firms.
	The sample size for the wine and processed meat sectors is formed by 231 and 288 active firms. While the inactive industries are 20 and 47 respectively.
	For the stochastic frontier production yit is defined as the deflated total sales in meat and wine product. xit is a (13) vector that contains three inputs: a) wage expenses, b) intermediate inputs and c) capital employed in the production process.
	 For the DA, the dependent variable is the time firms waited before exit market. from the set of explanatory variables, we use: a) age of firm represented by the Date of firms’ setting–up, c) leverage (ratio of debt to total assets), d) current ratio (is an indication of a company's ability to meet short-term debt), e) Technical efficiency, f) firm size (employee)  g) extraordinary results, h) Profit growth and i) Return on capital employed .
