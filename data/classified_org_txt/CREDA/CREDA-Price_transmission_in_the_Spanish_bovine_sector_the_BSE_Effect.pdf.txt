Abstract 

 

A regime-switching vector error correction model is applied to monthly price data to assess 

the impact of BSE outbreaks on price relationships and patterns of transmission among farm and 

retail markets for bovine in Spain. To evaluate the degree to which price transmission is affected by 

BSE food scares, a BSE food scare index is developed and used to determine regime-switching. 

Results suggest that BSE scares affect beef producers and retailers differently. Consumer prices are 

found to be weakly exogenous and not found to react to BSE scares, while producer prices 

conversely adjusted. The magnitude of the adjustment is found to depend on the magnitude of the 

BSE scare. 

 

Key words: BSE crisis, price transmission, regime-switching. 

JEL classification: C22, C32 

 

1.  Introduction 

 

When suspicions arose that Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was linked to a new-

variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD), a new food scare was generated. Apart from the obvious 

concerns about the impacts of the BSE on human health, there were also worries about the effect 

that the crisis might have on price transmission along the marketing chain. More specifically, there 

were suspicions that the crisis was having different impacts on retailers and producers. It was 

argued that producers were suffering stronger price declines than retailers, increasing the marketing 

margins in favor of retailers (Lloyd et al., 2006) and threatening farmers’ standard of living.   



The objective of this paper is to formally assess the impacts of the BSE crisis on price 

relationships and patterns of transmission among farm and retail markets for bovine in Spain. This 

analysis of the Spanish beef sector is important for several reasons. First, the magnitude of the BSE 

crisis in Spain has been significant. Spain ranks fifth in the European Union (EU)1 regarding the 

number of BSE cases registered since 1987 (World Organization for Animal Health, 2007).  

Second, the Spanish beef sector has substantial economic and social relevance both within 

Spain and within the EU. Beef is one of the most important activities in the Spanish agricultural 

sector, representing almost a fifth of the Spanish gross animal production (Ministerio de Medio 

Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino, 2006). Also, Spain occupies the fifth position in the EU 

rankings for bovine production with 671 thousand tons, representing 9% of total output (Eurostat, 

2007). The Spanish beef sector has relevance from a social perspective as well, since it constitutes, 

together with sheep farming, the main economic activity that can be carried out in several less-

favored mountain areas. It is thus interesting to see how the BSE crisis affected the overall 

operation of this important economic sector. 

This paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we present a brief overview of the 

Spanish BSE crisis.  A literature review of previous research is presented in the third section. The 

fourth section is devoted to discussing econometric methods. The empirical application and the 

discussion of the results are presented in the fifth and sixth sections, respectively. Finally, the article 

ends with the concluding remarks section.

2. The BSE in Spain 

 

The disease Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy was first identified in November 1986 in 

Britain by the government’s Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge. The number of BSE 

cases grew and spread both within the UK and to other EU countries. In particular, the first BSE 

cases identified outside Britain were in Ireland in 1989, Portugal and Switzerland in 1990, and 

France in 1991. In 1996 the UK Government confirmed the link between vCJD and BSE, 

confirming the most significant animal disease-related food scare in Europe (BBC NEWS, 2000).  

In November 2000, the Spanish government announced the first two cases of BSE in 

Galicia, which is a large beef producing region, where more than one third of all BSE cases in Spain 

have been registered (Administración General del Estado, 2009). Several regulations intended to 

prevent the spread of the disease were passed. For instance, the Royal Decree 3454/2000 on 

December 22, 2000 was enforced to establish and regulate an integrated program to monitor and 

control the spread of the disease (Ministerio de la Presidencia, 2009). Regional authorities also 

struggled to manage the crisis with a shortage of veterinarians properly trained to identify the 

disease and only two national laboratories able to conduct the BSE tests ordered by the EU.  

During the BSE crisis, Spanish beef production experienced significant changes. In 

particular, since no BSE cases were reported in Spain during the second half of the 1990s, 

production increased from 565 thousand tons, in 1996, to 678, in 1999. Production in 2000 was cut 

by almost 7% with respect to 1999, but recovered during the first half of the 2000s. Spanish foreign 

trade experienced even stronger changes. While Spanish beef exports increased from 1996 to 2000, 

they suffered a 21% decline in 2001. In 2002, the beef export market started to show signs of 

recovery. Imports increased during the second half of the 1990s but plummeted by 24% in 2001 and 

recovered in the subsequent years (Eurostat, 2007).  



Spain has the fourth lowest per capita consumption of beef in the EU, above Belgium, 

Germany and Sweden (FAO, 2005). Before the BSE crisis, Spanish per capita consumption of beef 

remained relatively constant around 10 kg per capita per year. In 2001, beef consumption decreased 

by 19% to 7.9 kg per capita. Total beef consumption also declined by 18%. Consumption went back 

to normal levels after 2001 (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino, 2005).      

As noted above, Spain is fifth in the EU ranking of BSE cases registered since 1987, after 

the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and France. The number of cows infected by BSE in Spain 

from 2000 to the end of 2007 was 717. As shown in figure 1, the number of cases increased from 

82, in 2001, to a peak of 167 cases, in 2003. Four years later, the number had fallen to 36. This 

evolution of the BSE crisis in Spain is consistent with the whole EU situation where the number of 

BSE infected animals is also declining (World Organization for Animal Health, 2009). 

 

3.  Previous research: a literature review 

 

Price is the primary mechanism through which different levels of the market are linked. The 

analysis of vertical price transmission allows for an approximation to the overall operation of the 

market (Goodwin and Holt, 1999). The magnitude of adjustment and speed with which shocks are 

transmitted are factors that reflect the competition in the food marketing chain and the market 

ability to adjust prices. 

The analysis of vertical price transmission among various levels of the food marketing chain 

has gained special importance in the economics literature since the end of the last century. The 

attention devoted to these analyses has been partly motivated by social and political concerns that 

originated with the progressive concentration processes that occurred in the food industry and in the 

distribution sector. These changes may affect the competitive position of the economic agents 



participating in the market as well as price dynamics. Recent developments in time series 

econometrics have also contributed to the renewed interest in price transmission analyses.  

Regime-switching models have received considerable attention within the price transmission 

literature. By making use of these techniques, several analyses have found that price shocks at one 

level of the marketing chain elicit different responses at other levels, depending on whether the 

shocks are positive or negative (see, for example, Goodwin and Piggott, 2001; Serra and Goodwin, 

2003; Ben Kaabia and Gil, 2007). Another common finding of previous analyses is that prices at the 

retail level are sticky or slowly-responsive to price changes at other levels of the marketing chain.  

Though a great number of studies and reports on the BSE crisis have been made available 

recently, literature regarding the economic impacts of food scares is relatively poor. Most of this 

literature has focused on the effects of food outbreaks on the demand for food (see, for example, 

Smith et al., 1988; Burton and Young, 1996; Mazzocchi, 2006; Piggott and Marsh, 2004). A few 

have tried to assess whether the BSE crisis altered the efficiency with which the sector operates 

(Iraizoz et al., 2005). However, the analyses of the effects of the BSE crisis on vertical price 

transmission are very scarce. A few notable exceptions are reviewed below. 

Lloyd et al. (2001 and 2006) assess the impacts of the BSE crisis on vertical price 

transmission within the UK beef market. They use a cointegration framework that captures the 

relationship between beef prices and a food safety index reflecting the number of newspaper articles 

published on the topic. The authors assume that the food safety index is an exogenous shock to the 

system. Their results show that the BSE crisis has had a stronger impact on producer prices than on 

retail prices. More specifically, the effects on producer prices are more than double the impacts at 

the retail level.  

Sanjuán and Dawson (2003) examine the impact of the BSE crisis on price transmission 

between producer and retailer prices for beef, lamb and pork in the UK. They use the cointegration 



procedure of Johansen et al. (2000) which allows for structural breaks in the cointegrated 

relationship. Their results show that a long-run relationship exists between producer and retail 

prices, which suffer from a structural break coinciding with the confirmation of the link between 

vCJD and BSE in 1996.  

The unpublished analysis by Livanis and Moss (2005) studies the effects of food scares on 

price transmission in the U.S beef sector. Their methodological approach is similar to Lloyd et al. 

(2001), though they allow for structural breaks and consider the food index as endogenous. Their 

findings imply that information shocks are fairly transient in retail prices, but persist at the 

wholesale and farm levels. In another unpublished manuscript, Jaenicke and Reiter (2003) focus on 

analyzing the structural breaks that the BSE crisis may have caused to the cointegration relationship 

between producer and consumer beef prices in Germany. Their findings provide evidence that the 

BSE outbreak altered the producer-consumer price mechanism. 

Common to the analyses revised above is the finding that the BSE crisis has altered price 

relationships and patterns of transmission along the beef marketing chain. The degree to which 

price transmission is affected by a food scare crisis is likely to depend on the scale of such crisis. 

Within this context, price relationships are likely to follow a regime-switching behavior and regime-

switches are likely to be driven by the magnitude of the food scare. If markets respond differently to 

distinct levels of a food scare, marketing margins may change depending on the regime prevailing 

at each point in time. This article focuses on assessing this issue. To achieve the aforementioned 

objective, we estimate a regime-switching vector error correction model that captures the 

relationship between farm and retail beef prices. A BSE food scare index is developed and used as 

the variable determining regime-switching. 

In spite of previous attempts to characterize price transmission responses to food scares, no 

previous analysis has allowed for regime-switching linked to the magnitude of the crisis, which 



represents a contribution of our work to the literature. Further, our analysis is the first to focus on 

the impacts of BSE on price transmission within the Spanish beef market. 

 

4.  Econometric methods 

 

4.1. Regime-Switching Autoregressive Models 

As previously mentioned, many empirical analyses have found evidence of nonlinear price 

transmission in food markets. Several econometric techniques have been developed to capture these 

nonlinearities. Early analyses were based on the econometric model introduced by Wolffram (1971) 

and later refined by Houck (1977) and Ward (1982). These specifications have been criticized for 

ignoring the time-series properties of the (usually nonstationary) data. Von-Cramon Taubadel 

(1998) extended the Wolffram specification to allow for an error correction term. More recently, 

Goodwin and Holt (1999) proposed using threshold vector error correction models (TVECM) to 

allow error correction specifications to adequately capture nonlinear and threshold-type price 

adjustments.  

Tong (1978) originally introduced nonlinear threshold time series models. Tsay (1989) 

developed a methodology to test for threshold nonlinearity based on autoregressions and to model 

threshold autoregressive processes. Balke and Fomby (1997) combined error correction models and 

the threshold autoregressive model developed by Tsay (1989) into a threshold error correction 

framework. These authors suggest implementing a grid search procedure to select the threshold 

parameters that delineate different regimes through minimizing the sum of squared errors.  

Consider a standard linear cointegration relationship between two variables, 1, 2,t t tP P vβ− = , 

where 1,tP  and 2,tP  are prices at different levels of the marketing chain and tv  represents the 

deviation from the equilibrium relationship. As is well known, cointegration between the two price 



series depends on the nature of the autoregressive process 1t t tv v uγ −∆ = + . A value of gamma close 

to one implies that deviations from the equilibrium are stationary and that the price series are 

cointegrated.  

Following Balke and Fomby (1997), this analysis can be extended to a regime-switching 

autoregressive (RSAR) process. A two-regime RSAR can be expressed as:

 is the variable determining regime-switching and d  is the lag of this variable (in this 

application we assume a delay of 1d = ). Parameter c  represents the threshold that delineates the 

different regimes and ( ) , 1 m mγ =  and 2  are speed of adjustment parameters that measure the rate at 

which prices adjust to disequilibria from the long run equilibrium relationship. The RSAR can be 

alternatively expressed as (1) (2)1 1 1 2( , ) ( , )t t t t t tv v d c d v d c d uγ γ− −∆ = + + , where  1 ( , )td c d = 1( )t ds c− ≤  

and 2 ( , )td c d = 1( )t ds c− > . When the threshold variable is a lagged residual of the error correction 

term,

4.2. Regime-Switching Vector Error Correction Models  

A Regime-Switching Vector Error Correction Model (RSVECM) is a multivariate version of 

the RSAR model. The RSVECM allows one to uncover potential nonlinearities in the adjustment of 

individual prices and provides more information about short-run price dynamics. Lo and Zivot 

(1999) have suggested that the multivariate RSVECM has higher power than univariate RSAR 

models. RSVECMs occur when some forcing variable (the variable relevant to the threshold 



behavior) leads to switching between different regimes and the variables in the model exhibit 

different types of behavior in each regime. Different regimes are represented by different parameter 

estimates of the underlying model. A two-regime RSVECM can be expressed as follows:

and ( )mαααα , is a vector of parameters. 

Our specific estimation strategy can be summarized as follows. First, standard unit root and 

cointegration tests are conducted in order to determine whether price series are stationary and 

whether they are cointegrated, respectively. Based on the assumption that different levels of food 

scares can lead to different price adjustment, we next estimate a two-regime RSVECM where a 

food scare information index is used as the threshold variable.3 Details on how this information 

index is built are provided below in subsection 4.4. Finally, we utilize the sup-LR statistic 

developed by Hansen and Seo (2002) to test for a linear VECM against the alternative of a 

RSVECM. Details on specification tests are given in the next subsection. 

The parameters of the multivariate RSVECM can be estimated using sequential multivariate 

least squares in two steps. In the first step, a grid search is carried out to estimate the threshold 

parameter, c .4 The threshold is searched over the values of the threshold variable and the search is 

restricted to ensure an adequate number of observations for estimating the parameters in each 

regime. Recently, Serra and Goodwin (2004) considered two general grid search approaches in the 

selection of thresholds which may not be equivalent. The first approach involves minimization of 

                                                 
3 The variable relevant to threshold behavior has been usually assumed to be the (lagged) error correction term and the 

threshold has been usually searched over the values of this term (see, for example, Goodwin and Piggott, 2001; or Serra 

and Goodwin, 2003). 

4 Several analyses that are based on threshold models have treated regime-switching as exogenous (see, for example, 

Chavas and Mehta, 2004). We adopt a more general model that incorporates this issue as endogenous.  



the sum of squared errors or, alternatively, the trace of the covariance matrix of the residual errors. 

This approach has been implemented by a number of empirical analyses (see, Balke and Fomby, 

1997; or Goodwin and Piggott, 2001). The second approach maximizes a likelihood function (see, 

for example, Obstfeld and Taylor, 1997; or Moschini and Meilke, 1989). As Serra and Goodwin 

(2004) explain, the kernel of the likelihood function involves the logged determinant of the residual 

covariance matrix. In our analysis, we follow the latter approach because, contrary to the first 

alternative, it does not ignore the cross equation correlation.  

Under the specified approach with variance-covariance matrix (Σ ), the vectors of 

parameters ( ) , 1m m =αααα  and 2  are estimated by iterated seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) 

method giving: 

 

( , ) 1 ( , )S c d n c d

where ( , )c d

Σ is a multivariate SUR estimate of var( )

The vector of the errors is represented by ( )(1) (2)'    t t tε ε ε= . In the second step, the least squares 

estimates of c  are obtained based on:

4.3. Specification tests 

After estimating the model, we test for the significance of the differences in parameters 

across relative regimes. The sup-LR test developed by Hansen and Seo (2002) is used to test for a 

linear VECM against the alternative of a RSVECM. The model under the null is ' 1t t tP x ε−∆ = +αααα  , 

while the model under the alternative can be expressed as 

( ) ( )
'

1 2'
1 1 1 2( , ) ( , )t t t t t tP x d c d x d c d ε− −∆ = + +α αα αα αα α . The sup-LR statistic can be computed in the following 

way: 

 

ln ln ( , )( )LR T c d
∧ ∧ ∧

= Σ − Σ ,                                                                                           (6) 

 

where 
∧

Σ  is the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals for the VECM, ( , )c d
∧ ∧

Σ  represents the 

variance-covariance matrix of the residuals of the RSVECM and T is the number of observations. 

The sup-LR statistic has a non-standard distribution because the threshold parameters are not 

identified under the null hypothesis. To calculate the p-value of the sup-LR statistic we carry out the 

residual bootstrap technique developed by Hansen and Seo (2002). A total of 500 simulations are 

run.  

 More specifically, we carry out a parametric residual bootstrap method to approximate the 

sampling distribution that requires the specification and estimation of the model under the null 

(VECM), an assumption on the distribution of the residuals of the model and the initial conditions. 

We assume that model residuals are distributed as a Normal (0,Σ), where Σ is the covariance 

structure of the original VECM. The initial values of the model variables are set equal to their actual 

values. Given the initial conditions, we generate random shocks of the residuals at each period and 

derive the vector of series by recursion. The sup-LR test is computed for each replicated sample and 



stored. The bootstrap p-value can be determined as the proportion of simulations under the null for 

which the simulated LR statistic exceeds the observed statistic.  

 

4.4. The food scare information index 

Our analysis evaluates the impacts of the BSE crisis on price relationships and patterns of 

transmission among farm and retail markets for bovine in Spain. As noted above, some evidence 

has suggested that the BSE crisis had an impact on the vertical price transmission processes (Lloyd 

et al., 2001, 2006). The degree to which price transmission is affected by a food scare crisis is likely 

to depend on the scale of the crisis. A food scare information index (FSII), based on the number of 

news articles published on the topic, is built in order to have a measure of this scale. The FSII is 

used as a threshold variable. Hence, we implicitly assume that different levels of food scare can lead 

to different price reactions and that the food scare index leads to switching between different price 

behavior regimes.  

The literature has suggested various methods to construct a FSII based on the news count. In 

our analysis we use the method proposed by Chern and Zuo (1997) to build a monthly food scare 

information index. Specifically, Chern and Zuo (1997) extended the cumulative method used by 

Brown and Schrader (1990) by building a new fat and cholesterol information index that considers a 

differentiated carryover weight for supporting and non-supporting articles. Also, the articles are 

assumed to have a finite duration and lag distribution as a source of information. The FSII index 

based on this method can be expressed as:

where NM
t i−
 is the number of relevant articles (both supporting and non-supporting) published 

during period t-i, 
i

W  is the weight attributed to the lagged period i  and n is number of lagged 

periods considered. This method not only allows for a carryover effect but also for a decay effect of 

information. The carryover and decay effects are captured by specifying the weight function and the 

total lag period. Chern and Zuo (1997) utilize a cubic or third-degree polynomial weight function 

(CWF) because it generates asymmetric weights. The cubic weight function can be written as: 

 

2 3
0 1 2 3iW i i iλ λ λ λ= + + +                                                                                       (8) 

 

where the λ s are parameters and i  is the number of lagged periods. The values of the coefficients 

need to be determined based on the following restrictions. First, the maximum weight lies 

somewhere between the current period ( 0i = ) and the last period ( i n= ). Second, the minimum 

weight occurs at 1i n= +  and is set to zero 1 0nW + = . Finally, the sum of weights over the current 

and lagged periods is equal to 1

and m can take any finite number.  

 



5.  Empirical application 

 

Our empirical analysis utilizes two series of monthly beef prices and one monthly series 

representing the food scare information index. Beef prices are observed from January 1996 to 

December 2005, giving a total of 120 observations. Price information includes both farm-gate 

prices for prime beef (1 to 2 years old) expressed in euros per 100 kilo and consumer prices 

expressed in euros per kilo. Both prices were obtained from the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y 

Medio Rural y Marino.5  

As noted above, health risks have received increasing attention among consumers in 

developed countries and strengthened the relationship between food scares, food consumption, and 

prices. More specifically, if consumers believe that beef is unsafe to eat, there will be a decline in 

the demand and possibly the price of beef. To investigate the impacts of food scare concerns during 

the BSE crisis on price relationships and patterns of vertical price transmission within the Spanish 

bovine sector and following the methodology outlined in subsection 4.4, we construct a FSII that 

captures the degree of the consumer food scare. The index is based on a monthly count of 

newspaper articles on the BSE crisis appearing in a major Spanish newspaper, EL PAÍS.  

Weinberger and Dillon (1980) suggest that supporting articles (unfavorable news) may be 

more influential than a similar amount of non-supporting articles (favorable news). It has been also 

reported that a similar quantity of unfavorable news weighs far more heavily on consumer decision-

making than favorable news (Chang and Kinnucan, 1991; Kinnucan and Myrland, 2000). However, 

Mazzochi (2006) argues that discrimination between favorable and unfavorable articles is highly 

                                                 
5 Farm gate prices are obtained from Boletín Mensual de Estadística, while consumer prices were made available to the 

authors upon request by the Subdirección General de Industria, Innovación y Comercialización Agraria. In the latter 

case, a weighted average of retail prices from the main cuts sold in the market is used.   



subjective. This can be especially true with the BSE crisis, since the long latent period of vCJD will 

not cause the same impact on the young than on the old population. Due to the aforementioned 

reasons and following Kim and Chern (1997) and Chern and Zuo (1997), we do not weigh articles 

depending on whether they are favorable or unfavorable.  

We construct our monthly FSII over the period from July 1995 to December 2005, by 

scanning all articles relevant to BSE crisis using different keywords.6 The keywords searched were 

“Vaca(s) Loca(s)” (mad cow), “Encefalopatía Espongiforme Bovina” (Bovine Spongiform 

Encephalopathy), and “Creutzfeldt-Jakob.” The number of news articles ranged from a maximum of 

354 in February 2001, to a minimum of 0 in a few months far from the peak of the crisis. The 

average was 20.8 news articles per month with a standard deviation of 44.12. By excluding 

geographical indicators from the keyword list, our FSII intends to include both the information on 

the development of the crisis in Spain and in other EU countries. Due to the important trade 

relationships between Spain and the EU, Spanish markets are likely to have been affected by the 

development of the food scare in other EU countries. As a result, despite the fact that the BSE was 

first identified in November 2000 in Spain, the FSII is developed from 1995, in order to capture the 

impacts of earlier infections in other countries.  

Following Chern and Zuo (1997), we computed our monthly FSII using different values for 

both the number of lags (n) and peak times (m) and found the index to remain relatively stable 

across these values. In light of these results, we selected n=6 which is consistent with the 

                                                 
6 Though our analysis focuses on the January 1996 to December 2005 period, the monthly count was carried out for a 

longer period in order to allow for lags in the computation of the FSII. 



recommendation by Clarke (1976) and requires m to be equal or less than two. Since the FSII is 

very similar independently of the chosen value for the peak time, we selected m=1.7  

The monthly food scare information index used in our analysis is presented in figure 2. A 

comparison of this figure with figure 1 containing the evolution of the BSE cases in Spain suggests 

that the perception that economic agents have on the crisis does not necessarily keep pace with the 

number of infected animals. Small index increases occurring around 1996 are due to mass media 

reporting the link between the vCJD and the BSE. The index skyrockets during 2000-2001 when 

the BSE finally entered Spain. Additionally, after 2002 the BSE cases and the FSII follow different 

paths. In spite of the fact that infections continued to be found after the onset of the crisis, they were 

reported with less emphasis by mass media.  

A dummy variable representing the months when the crisis peaked in terms of mass media 

reporting (from February to April 2001) is introduced as a regime-independent variable in the short-

run specification of the RSVECM. This dummy also coincides with the first BSE cases detected in 

Spain. 

 

6. Results 

 

As noted above, our empirical analysis utilizes monthly farm-gate and consumer beef prices. 

It is also based upon a newspaper index that is a measure of the degree of food scare on a monthly 

basis. The empirical analysis is based on a logarithmic transformation of prices. Standard Dickey 

                                                 
7 Results of the index using different lags and peak times are not presented here, but are available from the authors upon 

request.  



and Fuller (1979) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski et al., 1992) tests for each price series provide evidence 

that all price series are integrated of order one I(1).8  

After testing for unit roots, the Engle and Granger (1987) test for cointegration is used. In 

doing so, the equilibrium relationship is normalized by the producer price and ordinary least squares 

(OLS) are used to obtain estimates of the cointegrating parameters (see table 1). The normalization 

variable is selected according to previous research results that confirm that while producer prices 

tend to adjust to their long-run parity, consumer prices are sticky or slowly-responsive to price 

changes occurring at other levels of the marketing chain (see Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Borenstein 

et al., 1997; Peltzman, 2000). This is confirmed later in our analysis. The Engle and Granger (1987) 

test indicates the existence of a cointegration relationship among producer and consumer price 

series (see table 2).9 Other analyses have also found evidence of cointegration between producer 

and consumer prices for beef (Lloyd et al., 2001; Sanjuán and Dawson, 2003; Jaenicke and Reiter, 

2003; Livanis and Moss, 2005). 

                                                 
8 The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as Schwartz Bayesian Criterion (SBC) are used to select the proper 

lag length of the autoregressive process. When the two criteria differ, we use the more parsimonious SBC criteria 

(Enders, 1995, p. 88; Wang and Liu, 2006). Results are available from the authors upon request. 

9 It is important to note that Johansen (1988) cointegration test is also applied and suggests that the hypothesis of no 

cointegration can be rejected at the 5% significance level. Furthermore, results present no significant differences when 

using the error correction term obtained from Johansen or Engle and Granger method. In light of these results, we select 

the latter test which is consistent with the recommendation by Enders (1995, p.385) in the presence of a single 

cointegration vector. The LM test for constancy of the cointegration parameters (Hansen and Johansen, 1999) suggests 

constancy of these parameters throughout the period studied. Results are available from the authors upon request. 



A RSVECM is then estimated by using sequential multivariate least squares in two steps10. 

The threshold derived from the grid search and the sup-LR statistic are presented in table 3.11 The 

sup-LR test statistic indicates that nonlinearities are statistically significant at the 95% confidence 

level.12 This involves the existence of different price behavior depending on the number of news 

articles published on the BSE crisis. Specifically, price behavior can be classified into two regimes, 

one corresponding to food scare index values FSII<=31.218, and a second regime corresponding to 

FSII>31.218. In table 4 we present the RSVECM parameter estimates across the different regimes. 

Parameter estimates suggest that producer prices adjust to deviations from the long-run 

equilibrium relationship. Conversely, consumer prices are exogenous and do not adjust to system 

disequilibria. The BSE crisis seems to have affected Spanish beef farmers and retailers differently, 

since all adjustments to deviations from equilibrium occur at the producer level. The producer price 

presents two different adjustments. More specifically, producer price responses are slower (-37%) 

when the weighted number of news articles is not greater than 31 (regime I), than when the news 

are above this threshold (-70% for regime II). The response in the latter regime is almost double the 

response in the first regime.  

                                                 
10 The optimum number of lags is selected by considering the Breusch-Godfrey Lagrange Multiplier test for 

autocorrelation and the SBC and AIC criterion. Though the SBC and AIC criterion recommend the use of just one lag, 

three lags are used in the estimation to avoid autocorrelated residuals. 

11 The bootstrap process needed to compute the p-value of the sup-LR test is computationally intensive. To keep 

computations manageable, we limit the number of simulations to 500 for each model. 

12 A three regime model was tested against a two regime one and results suggest no significant differences between the 

two models. Results are not presented here, but are available from the authors upon request.  



Figure 3, presents the timing of jumps between the two alternative regimes.13 The figure 

illustrates that regime I, which has the majority of observations, coincides with periods following an 

important crisis, i.e. the crisis following the confirmation in 1996 by the UK government that the 

BSE is linked to the vCJD, and the crisis originated by the contamination of Spanish cattle at the 

end of the 2000s. These two crises are represented by regime II (threshold higher than 31), where 

the strongest adjustment takes place.    

While our results are compatible with previous research results on the BSE crisis, the use of 

a RSVECM offers an advantage over previous studies based on cointegration relationships, since it 

allows for different adjustment processes depending on the market situation. In this regard, our 

analysis represents a contribution to previous studies on the impacts of the BSE crisis on price 

transmission mechanisms. In using the FSII as the threshold variable, we are able to assess how 

price adjustment changes depending on the degree of food scare.   

 

7.  Concluding remarks 

 

Food borne diseases are not only a relevant public health issue, but they also have important 

economic implications. The objective of this paper is to formally assess the impacts of the BSE 

crisis on price relationships and patterns of transmission among farm and retail markets for bovine 

in Spain. The degree to which price transmission is affected by a food scare crisis is likely to 

depend on the scale of such crisis. To the extent that this occurs, price relationships are likely to 

                                                 
13 It is important to note here that the behavior of the threshold variable is parallel to the behavior of the error correction 

term. The error correction term reaches its peaks when the food scare information index is highest and is closer to zero 

for low levels of the index. This is expected and allows forecasting that the use of the error correction term instead of 

the index as the threshold variable may not have substantially altered the results. 



show a threshold-type behavior and regime-switching is likely to be driven by the degree of food 

scare. To capture this issue a food scare information index is used.   

In spite of previous attempts to characterize price transmission responses to food scares, no 

previous analysis has allowed for regime-switching linked to the magnitude of the crisis, which 

represents a contribution of our work to the literature. Our analysis also contributes to previous 

literature in that we focus on the impacts of BSE on price transmission within the Spanish beef 

market, a market that has not been investigated. 

To achieve the aforementioned objective, we estimate a RSVECM. Our empirical model 

utilizes two series of monthly farm and retail beef prices and one monthly series representing the 

food scare information index. The food scare information index is built following Chern and Zuo 

(1997) and based on a count of newspaper articles on the zoonosis that appeared in a major Spanish 

newspaper. 

The results of this paper can be summarized as follows. Standard unit root tests confirm the 

presence of a unit root in each price series. Cointegration tests provide evidence of a long-run 

equilibrium relationship between producer and consumer prices. Other analyses have also found a 

long-run equilibrium relationship between beef prices at different levels of the marketing chain.  

The estimated RSVECM suggests that the BSE crisis affects beef producers and retailers 

differently. Consumer prices, which are found to be exogenous, do not adjust to disequilibria caused 

by the food scare. Conversely, producer prices are endogenous and do all the adjustment. These 

results are expected and are compatible with previous research that has suggested that upstream 

prices in the marketing chain generally do all the adjustment, while consumer prices are sticky and 

slowly-responsive. Finally, the sup-LR test statistic indicates that nonlinearities are statistically 

significant. 



If only producer prices adjust, producer margins will be squeezed while retail margins will 

not. Distributional issues will thus arise. This will increase the likelihood of producers abandoning 

the sector during strong crises and probably increases the need for public intervention if this is to be 

prevented. Reinforcing regulatory compliance as well as private food safety investments should be 

useful in this regard. Strengthening food safety measures from the farm to the table would increase 

reputation for safe food production, and reduce contamination of food and food born diseases. The 

costs these measures have on small producers may pay off the costs they would face in case of a 

food scare developed due to a lack of controls. This however remains an area for further research.  

This paper can be extended in a number of ways. First, it would be useful to implement the 

proposed methodology to other food scare crises and see if the same conclusions hold. Serra et al. 

(2006) explained that non-parametric techniques can be used to overcome the limitations involved 

with parametric threshold models. This would allow for an evaluation into the extent to which our 

results are subject to the specific functional forms used in the analysis.
