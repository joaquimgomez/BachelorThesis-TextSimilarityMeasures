Abstract 

The objective of this paper is to analyse consumers’ attitudes and acceptability of GM 

food products in Spain. From the methodological point of view, a three-equation model 

of consumer behaviour is estimated assuming a kind of causal chain among the degree 

of knowledge, attitudes and buying intentions. Explanatory variables include socio-

economic characteristics of respondents as well as endogenous variables of the previ-

ous equations. The model provides a better knowledge of how attitudes and buying in-

tentions towards GM food are formed. Higher educated consumers, more concerned 

about labelling information and less about price, and regular buyers of organic foods 

show a higher (not necessarily better) knowledge on GM technology and its conse-

quences. However, those consumers with a lower level of knowledge, together with 

those who are not concerned about safety, are not used to recycle but to purchase fast 

food generate more positive attitudes towards GMs, which finally determine future pur-

chasing intention. 

 

Key words: GM foods, Spain, consumers’ attitudes, econometric model 

 

 

Introduction 

Biotechnology has become an expanding discipline with a wide variety of applica-

tions including agriculture and food production. Agro-food applications of genetic ma-

nipulation technology has proved to be able to provide a cost efficient way to produce 

new, value added or price competitive food products. Initially, Genetically Modified 

(GM) products were targeted to producers and the rate of adoption has been relatively 

important, mainly in the United States. 

The global area of transgenic crops was 1.7 million has., in 1996, having increased 

more than 52-fold in only 9 years to reach 90 million has., in 2005, grown by 8.5 mil-

lion farmers in 21 countries (James, 2005). Only seven countries grew almost 97% of 

the total transgenic crop area: USA (55%), Argentina (19%), Brasil (10%), Canada 

(6%), China (4%), Paraguay (2%) and India (1%). Among them, China shows the high-

est growth in the last years. Other 7 countries grew transgenic crops, at least, margin-

ally: Australia, Mexico, Bulgaria, Uruguay, Romania, Spain, Indonesia and Germany. 

The principal GM crops are soybean (60% of total area), corn (24%), cotton (11%) and 

canola (5%). The dominant traits are herbicide tolerance and insect resistance.

In spite of such apparent success among farmers, nowadays, genetic manipulation 

techniques have become a topical and controversial issue with intensive media cover-

age. Society has recognised that together with some benefits to farmers there may exist 

some risks to humans although, at least up to our knowledge, the extent of those risks is 

as yet unknown. Consumers’ concerns have generated some reactions of public authori-

ties, placing restrictions on imports or imposing mandatory labelling for foodstuffs con-

taining GM ingredients. Although such consumers’ concerns took place initially in 

European countries, they have been extended worldwide.  

Several studies have recognized the importance of a better understanding of consum-

ers’ reactions to GM food. Early studies focussed on their attitudes and perceptions to-

wards the new products. Most of them were very qualitative in nature simply offering 

ratings of general attitudes or whether consumers were willing to purchase these prod-

ucts (Kelley, 1995; Hoban, 1998; Smith and Riethmuller, 1999; Wolf and Domegan, 

2002; Spetsidis and Schamel, 2001; and Mendenhall and Evenson, 2002; among oth-

ers). More recently, studies on consumers’ acceptability of GM products have become 

more quantitative trying to incorporate the circumstances under which GM products 

become available. Contingent valuation (Boccaletti and Moro, 2000; and Moon and 

Balasubramanian, 2001) and choice modelling (Burton et al., 2001; and Chern and 

Rickertsen, 2002) have been the most useful tools to analyse to what extent consumers 

were willing to pay non-GM products. More recently, Verdurme and Vianne (2002) 

have specified a Structural Equation Model to analyse a hypothetical model including 

consumers’: 1) socio-demographic characteristics; 2) attitudes towards food; 3) knowl-

edge about GM technology; 4) beliefs; and 5) attitudes towards GM food, for different 

consumer segments. However, the validity of the hypothetical model is only assessed 

for individual relationships: 1) and 2) on 3); 3) on 4); and 4) on 5).  

This paper lies in the last set of studies being the main objective to jointly analyse 

consumers’ knowledge, attitudes and acceptability of GM food products in Spain. From 

the methodological point of view, an attempt is made to estimate a complete model of 

consumer behaviour. 

Consumer beliefs, attitudes and behaviour may occur directly or indirectly (Mowen, 

1993; and Verdurme et al., 2001). In the first case, the three elements are created inde-

pendent of each other. In the second case, a kind of causal chain among the three ele-

ments can be established, taking into account that in the case of GM products we are 

referring to behavioural intention due to the limited availability of such products.  

In this paper a three-equation model is estimated. The three equations are: the level 

of information consumers have, their attitudes towards GM food, and, finally, their will-

ingness to buy such products. Explanatory variables include socio-economic character-

istics and lifestyles of respondents as well as endogenous variables from previous equa-

tions. The aim is to provide a better knowledge of how attitudes and buying intentions 

towards GM food are formed.  

The paper is organised as follows. First, some descriptive data from the survey is of-

fered. Second, the theoretical model of consumer behaviour is formulated as well as its 

econometric specification. Third, results from the estimated model are provided. Fi-

nally, some concluding remarks are outlined.

Consumers’ knowledge, attitudes and purchasing intention towards GM food 

Data used in this study come from a telephone survey carried out at national level us-

ing a random digit dialling method. In total 660 responses were collected as valid. Re-

spondents were selected according to a proportional quota sampling method with age of 

the household head and region as quota variables. A similar structured questionnaire as

in Chern and Rickertsen (2002) was used. It was divided into five sections. First con-

sumers’ knowledge and awareness towards GM products was investigated. Second, 

consumers’ attitudes and perceptions to food attributes and more specifically towards 

GM products were explored. The third section dealt with labelling. The fourth section 

was devoted to buying intentions where respondents had to choose between the GM and 

the counterpart non-GM product. Corn flakes are used as an example. Finally, the ques-

tionnaire collected some socio-economic characteristics and purchasing habits of re-

spondents whose average values are summarized in Table 1. 

Let us briefly describe some of the main results dealing with Spanish consumers’ 

knowledge and awareness, attitudes and purchasing intentions of GM food. We will 

compare the results obtained from this survey with those found in Chern and Rickertsen 

(2002) for US and Norway. Table 2 shows that 61% considered they were not informed 

about GM foods, a percentage which is much higher than in the case of Norway and US 

even though the survey was implemented nine months later and during that period the 

number of existing debates and information available on press and TV has notably in-

creased. Only 3.5% of Spanish respondents considered themselves very well informed. 

The questionnaire also included two knowledge statements trying to detect if con-

sumers’ knowledge was correct. Results are also included in Table 2. Consistent with 

the previous question, almost two thirds of respondents did not know if the statement 

“Non-genetically modified soybeans do not contain genes while genetically modified 

soybeans do” was true or false. Only 23.5% of respondents answered correctly to this 

statement, a percentage much lower than in the other two countries considered. In rela-

tion to the second statement “By eating GM foods, a person’s genes could be altered”, 

almost 32% of respondents believed it was false, a more or less similar result than that 

obtained for Norway but far away from US respondents who, in general terms, showed 

a better knowledge about GM foods. In the case of Spain, the degree of knowledge was 

better among younger and higher educated people.

clear opinion or simply did not know what to answer was relatively high (18% of re-

spondents). In the case of Norway, respondents were more precise (60% perceived GM 

foods as risky for human health while 35% thought they were safe). In the US results 

were similar than in the case of Spain, although the number of undecided population 

was lower. 

The lower degree of knowledge and the negative image of GM foods determine that, 

in the case of Spain, only 20% of respondents were willing to consume foods produced 

with GM ingredients (percentages were 30 %, for Norway, and 43%, for US) and, quite 

surprisingly here, the number of undecided respondents were very low. On the opposite 

side, 45% of Spanish respondents were extremely unwilling to consume GM foods, a 

similar percentage as in Norway. In the US, opinions were not so extreme and the larger 

percentage of respondents concentrated their answers in the “somewhat” box (either 

willing or unwilling).  

Respondents’ attitudes towards GM food were toned down when some benefits asso-

ciated to the GM food were explicitly included in the question. Two main benefits were 

included: 1) the reduction of pesticides in agricultural production; and 2) the improve-

ment of the nutritional content of the “new” food. In Spain, around 20% of respondents 

changed their opinion in favour of GM foods when associated benefits were mentioned 

to them (the percentage is slightly higher when the nutritional content is improved). In 

US similar patterns have been observed, that is, consumers’ willingness to consume GM 

foods increased in higher proportion when the benefit refers to the improvement of the 

nutritional value (the percentage of respondents who changed their mind towards GM 

foods was 30% when the nutritional value is improved while the percentage is only 25% 

if the benefit is related to pesticides reduction). Finally, in Norway, benefits associated 

to the production of GM food only generated a slight change in consumers’ attitudes. In 

fact, the percentage of respondents willing to consume GM foods only changes by 8%, 

independently of the associated benefit. 

Finally, potential sources of concern among consumers were also investigated. When 

respondents were faced with the potential risk of causing allergic reactions to people, 

89% of Spanish, 84% of Norwegians and 40% of Americans were extremely unwilling 

to consume GM food. On the opposite side, 35% of Americans seems to accept the risk 

while this percentage is much lower in Norway (10%) and Spain (2%).  

Ethical and religious considerations are not important for European consumers when 

deciding to consume or not GM foods. In fact, 75% of Spanish and 65% of Norwegian 

respondents declare such concerns as somewhat or extremely unimportant. In US, on 

the contrary, ethical and religious concerns are important for one third of respondents. 

As a conclusion, from Table 3 it seems that European consumers are less favourable 

to GM foods than people in the US. In relation to the two European countries, Spanish 

respondents show a lower degree of knowledge and a larger number of undecided peo-

ple about genetic modification technology. 

Let us finish this presentation of the main descriptive results obtained from the ques-

tionnaire saying something about the purchasing intention of respondents. We asked 

respondents to choose between a non-GM and a GM corn flake box assuming identical 

prices for both of them. The selected price or base price was a simple average of market 

prices of two brands in twenty-five retail outlets all over Spain. Results indicated that 

70% of respondents would choose the non-GM product, 5% indicated that both products 



AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS REVIEW 56 

were attractive, 18% would choose neither the GM nor the non-GM product, and fi-

nally, only 7% would select the GM corn flakes box. 

In a next step, we have assumed that GM food products are cheaper than the non-GM 

counterpart. The same options as above were offered to respondents including some 

price reductions (from 10% to 30%) for the GM corn flakes box. Only 4% of respon-

dents changed their mind from non-GM to GM corn flakes but the more surprising re-

sult is that such percentage was almost identical independently of the price reduction 

offered to respondents, indicating that prices cannot be considered as a determinant of 

consumer behaviour, at least in relation to GM food products.  

To what extent consumers’ knowledge and awareness about GM foods affect their 

attitudes and how attitudes are related to purchasing intention, the main objective of this 

paper, will be discussed in the next section. 

 

 

Theoretical and econometric model 

It is widely acknowledged that consumers’ decisions are the result of a complex 

process not always very well understood as many personal and environmental factors 

may contribute to final choices. Consumers’ knowledge or beliefs, attitudes and behav-

iour are formed interdependently following some kind of causal chains or hierarchies of 

effects. There exist three main hierarchies of effect models depending on the purchasing 

situations (Verdurme et al., 2001): 

a) The standard or high-involvement hierarchy assumes that the consumer is a rational 

problem solver. In this case, the order of consumer responses is the following: 

knowledge is first, then attitudes and finally behaviour (learn-feel-do). 

b) In low-involvement purchasing situations, where consequences of a wrong decision 

are very limited, beliefs come first, then behaviour and finally attitudes (learn-do-

feel). 

c) In impulse purchases or situations where consumers are highly involved with the 

final outcome, the experiential hierarchy applies. In this case behaviour comes first, 

then attitudes and finally knowledge (do-feel-learn). 

Recent food scares has increased consumers’ concerns on food products which has 

provoked that many food products have moved from the low involvement categories to 

the high ones. It means that consumers want to be better informed before taking deci-

sions making attitudes highly dependent on the degree of knowledge. Finally, both be-

liefs and attitudes affect purchasing decisions. It is assumed that respondents’ socio-

economic characteristics and food habits and lifestyles may affect the three dimensions 

of our model. 

Taking these issues into account, three dependent variables have been defined: 

knowledge of GM technology (
i

K ), consumer attitudes towards GM products (
i

A ) and, 

finally, GM foods purchasing intention (
i

C ). These three variables are modelled as a 

recursive system such that

Knowledge is a binary variable indicating whether an individual has some 

information about GM products before the survey ( 1=

The consumer attitude towards GMO products (

original five ordered degrees (Table 3, 2

dium and high) (the extreme and somewhat categories have been jointly considered). 

Consequently, this variable has been categorised by an ordered polychotomous response

In the paper, the methodology mentioned above has been applied to explain the pur-

chasing intention of corn flakes. As the estimation of the trivariate model given by (1), 

(5) and (6), maximizing expression (9) is rather complex, we have estimated first each 

equation individually to have an idea of what should be the most relevant explanatory 

variables that should be included in each equation. Among the socio-economic vari-

ables, only the education level was found to be significant. Also, we found significant 

behaviour differences in respondents living in the South of Spain. In general terms, food 

habits (Table 1) were relevant to explain some of the dependent variables.  

The complete list of variables included in the model is shown in Table 4. As we are 

dealing with corn flakes, we have included in the purchasing intention equation one 

dichotomous variable, which took the unit value if the respondent had bought corn 

flakes in the last three months and zero, otherwise. As consumers’ price sensitiveness 

was null, taking into account the results mentioned in Section 2, the third equation has 

not been possible to be defined as a traditional willingness-to-pay equation. Alterna-

tively, we have only measured the willingness-to-buy. 

Finally, the questionnaire also includes some questions trying to detect what were the 

main attributes consumers took into account when purchasing foods. Respondents had 

to rate on a 1 to 5 scale the following attributes: price, convenience, safety, taste, nutri-

tious and shelf life. We considered such responses could have some influence, at least, 

in the first two equations. Instead of including the six attributes we first carried out a 

factor analysis reducing the six variables to three factors, which explained 78% of total 

variance. The first factor “convenience” (F1, in table 4) was positively correlated with 

the convenience, taste and nutritious attributes. The second factor “safety” (F2 in Table 

4) was positively correlated with the shelf life and safety attributes. Finally, the third 

factor “price” (F3 in Table 4) was positively correlated with the attribute of the same 

name.

Estimation results 

In Table 5 estimated parameters for the three-equation model are shown. In general 

terms, signs of parameters are quite consistent with expectations. Socio-economic vari-

ables were not relevant, as mentioned above, except for the education level and the re-

spondent’s region of residence.

High-educated consumers have a better knowledge, or at least, have collected more 

information, about GM technology. Also, people who normally are used to read food 

labels have shown more interest in knowing something about GM food products. Fi-

nally, in relation with the food attributes consumers take into account when purchasing 



AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS REVIEW 62 

food, it seems that respondents more worried about food prices have a lower knowledge 

on GM foods. Finally, convenience and safety attributes have no influence on the in-

formation level respondents have on GM technology. 

Consumers’ knowledge on GM organisms is negatively related to positive attitudes 

towards GM food. This is not a very surprising result as respondents have gathered in-

formation on GM technology mainly through mass-media in which more attention has 

been paid, up to now, on negative implications of such technology. Similarly, respon-

dents worried about safety issues when buying food or characterised by an active recy-

cling behaviour show more negative attitudes towards GM products. On the contrary, 

consumers showing a higher frequency of buying fast food or ready-to-eat meals have 

more positive attitudes towards GM foods. Finally, at least for Spain, people living in 

the South seem to have more positive attitudes to such products. 

The last equation shows main factors explaining the intention of Spanish consumers 

to buy GM corn flakes. As the dependent variable took the unit value for the non-GM 

cereal, a negative sign in the corresponding parameter will indicate some potential for 

future GM consumption. A positive attitude towards GM foods implies an intention to 

buy GM corn flakes. The same happens in the case of corn flakes regular consumers 

(more experienced consumers seem not to pay attention to characteristics of the raw 

commodity). Finally, Spanish respondents living in the South seem to exhibit a better 

predisposition to buy GM corn flakes. 

 

 

Concluding remarks 

The aim of this paper has been twofold. On one hand, attitudes and purchasing inten-

tions of Spanish consumers towards GM foods and, particularly, towards GM corn 

flakes, as a case study, are analysed. On the methodological side, the paper has aimed to 

provide an econometrical framework, which was able to jointly model the hierarchy of 

effects in high involvement purchasing situations. It has been assumed that the degree 

of knowledge about GM technology affects attitudes towards GM food, which finally 

determine future purchasing intentions. 

Using a similar questionnaire as previous studies in Norway and US, the paper shows 

a lower knowledge level about GM technology in Spain in comparison with the other 

two mentioned countries. Also, results from our survey clearly indicate a more negative 

attitude among Spanish consumers towards GM foods and, consequently, a lower inten-

tion to buy such GM foods. 

The estimated model confirms some results found recently in the literature suggest-

ing that purchasing food has become a high involvement decision and this is more evi-

dent when there can exist some consequences on human health or on the environment. 

Our results indicate a kind of a causal chain between knowledge, attitudes and purchas-

ing intention. Higher educated consumers, more concerned about labelling information 

and less about price, and regular buyers of organic foods show a higher (not necessarily 

better) knowledge on GM technology and its consequences. However, those consumers 

with a lower level of knowledge, together with those who are less concerned about food 

safety issues, are not used to recycle but to purchase fast food exhibit a more positive 

attitude towards GMs in Spain, which finally determine future purchasing intention. 

Results obtained in this paper have to be considered only as the outcome of a case 

study. Further extensions to other products and other countries are needed to get a final 



2007, Vol 8, No 1 63 

conclusion about consumers’ behaviour in relation to GM foods. On the methodological 

side, our aim has been only to provide an alternative strategy to other modelling ap-

proaches as structural equations modelling, commonly used in marketing research.
