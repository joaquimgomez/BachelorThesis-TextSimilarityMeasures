Abstract  
Most of Spanish olive farms are concentrated in Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) with the 
majority of producer areas are under Objective 1 of the EU Regional Policy. The EU 
has long recognized such distinctive characteristics of those holdings with a specific 
support measures aiming to prevent the abandonment of olive groves as well as to 
support sustainable development of this sector. The main objective of this study is to 
evaluate the impact of LFA payment on the olive farms technical efficiency. Two 
sample farms located in LFA (63 farms receiving LFA payment support and 99 farms 
do not) have been observed from 2000 to 2004. A stochastic frontier production has 
been used.  
Results indicate that LFA payment, age of manager, tenure regimes of land, workforce 
composition and farm size affect efficiency levels. The LFA payment coefficient 
indicates a significant negative impact on the technical efficiency of Spanish olive 
farms. The farms that not receive the LFA payment has a technical efficiency rate 0.15 
percentage units upper compared to those that receive this payment. Thus, the payment 
policy could decreases farms technical efficiency which could represents a handicap for 
farms economic survival and its persistence in the long term period.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Spanish olive sector has a distinguished presence in worldwide agriculture 

sector. Such situation is manifested by the importance of its production and exportation, 
being the leading country with 38.9% and 40% respectively (IOC, 2009). Moreover, 
this sector covers 2,483,697 hectares with 308 million trees, representing more than 
25% of the world's growing area (MARM, 2009). 

 
This sector is mainly made up of a large number of small farms size whose 

productions is characterized by vulnerability to annual variation, low profitably, and 
heterogeneity, both in space and time. Most of those holdings are concentrated in Less 
Favored Areas (hereafter, LFA), and are considered under Community Regional Policy 
Objective 1 with a few exceptions. Beside its production function, in these areas the 
olive sector represents an important source of employment and a solid column of the 
social and economic development. It provides a full-time as well as seasonal 
employment -olive picking in particular- which supplement farm workers’ income since 
demand for farm labor is concentrated in the rest of year. Moreover, olive farms play a 
role in the protection of the vulnerable area from desertification and loss of biodiversity. 
The olive cultivation is considered as an instrument tool in addressing environmental 
problems given it high undemanding, efficient water resource use and well-adaptability 
to Mediterranean region conditions. Its positive impact on the environment makes it’s 
an important tool to combat desertification in these region. 

 
The European Union (EU) has long recognized such special characteristics of the 

LFA. They has identified two main LFA types: a) mountain areas (in Spain, areas with a 
minimum altitude of 1000m or a slope greater than 20% or a minimum altitude of 600m 
plus a slope of at least 15%) and b) other LFA characterized by poor productivity, 
specific handicaps, low population, etc. It is worth to mention that 58% of the total 
Utilized Agriculture Area (UAA) in the EU is classified as LFA, while in Spain, 81.8% 
of UAA is located in LFA, in which 33.7% is LFA-Mountain and 48.1% in LFA-others. 

 
The EU under the rural development program applied during 2000-20061 

(Regulation No 1257/1999) has provided the LFA farms with a specific support 
measures as compensatory payment granted per hectare of agricultural area. These 
measures aim to avoid the abandonment of olive groves in marginal areas, to maintain a 
viable rural community, to promote sustainable farming systems which in particular 
take account of environmental protection requirements and to support a sustainable 
development through the promotion of healthy and quality products.  

 
Previous literature has demonstrated that policy support could have impact on 

different farms’ aspects. In this line, some papers have analyzed their impact on 
production decision (Moro and Sckokai, 1999; Oude Lansink and Peerlings, 1996), 
investment decision (Oude Lansink et al., 2001; Carey and Zilberman, 2002 and Wabi 
et al., 2006) and technical efficiency (Bezlepkina et al., 2005, Kleinhanß et al., 2007, 
and Lambarraa et al., 2009). However, up to date, there are no published studies that 
have analyzed the impact of LFA payment on farm’s technical efficiency, especially in 
Spain.

The main objective of this study is to analyze the determinants factor of farms 
technical efficiency as well as the impact of LFA payment on such efficiency. To 
achieve this objective, we assess a technical efficiency of two different samples farms 
located in LFA and differentiate by receiving or not a support payment using a 
stochastic frontier (SF) model. The analysis focuses on farm-level data observed from 
2000 to 2004, based on the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). 

 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section gives a 

review of the SF methodology. This is followed by an empirical application. In Section 
4 the results are discussed. Finally, some conclusions are outlined. 

 
2. METHODOLOGY 
 

To analyze the impact of LFA payment on technical efficiency, first a stochastic 
frontier methodology has been used. This technique implies a specification of two error 
components. The technical inefficiency error term that measures the extent to which 
actual production falls short of maximum attainable output, and is augmented by a two-
sided error component (v) representing other factors that might generate irrelevant noise 
in the data (such as measurement error and unobserved inputs). itv  is assumed to be iid 

2(0, )vN  , and itu  is a vector of independently distributed and nonnegative random 
disturbances. 

 
We use maximum likelihood techniques to estimate the stochastic production 

frontier model. This model can be expressed as follows:  
 

-( , ; ) it itv uit ity f x t e   [1] 
 
where ity  is the output of the i-th firm ( 1,...,i N ) in period 1,...,t T , ( , ; )itf x t   

represents the production technology, itx  is a (1 )K  vector of inputs and other factors 
influencing production associated with the i -th firm in period t ,   is a ( 1)K   vector 
of unknown parameters to be estimated. 

 
The technical efficiency of a producer at a certain point in time can be expressed as 

the ratio of actual output to the maximum potential output:

Following Battese and Coelli (1995), technical inefficiency is assumed to respond 

to the following pattern of behavior: ( )

N  is a random variable defined by the

3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION 

 
As mentioned for empirical application we have used the FADN data for the period 

2000-2004. The FADN Data set was launched in 1965 with the objective to monitor the 
income and business activities of agricultural holdings and to evaluate the impacts of 
the Common Agricultural Policy measures. It is a European system of sample surveys 
that take place each year and collect information from each farm includes physical, 
structural, economic and financial data. This data set provides representative data of EU 
agricultural holdings along three dimensions: region, economic size and type of 
farming. This dataset classifies farms into different typologies that allow identifying the 
main types of farming. In this study, we used the olive farms located in LFA other than 
mountains, given that the majority of the data available is located in this area. 
Moreover, This LFA type is more representatives in the Spanish case representing 60% 
of Spanish LFA area. Aggregates data on annual input and output price indices are 
taken from Eurostat. A two unbalanced panel data sample of Spanish olive farms are 
used. A total of 162 olive farms are observed from 2000 to 2004, which 99 farms of the 
sample receive the LFA payment support.  

 
Following previous studies (e.g Karagiannis and Tzouvelekas, 2001), the 

production frontier function in [1] is specified as a Translog function that takes the 
form:

Where 1i , ,N   indexes the farms in the sample, 1t , ,T   indicates the time 
period, 1k , j , ,K  indicate the conventional inputs used in the production process, β 
is the vector of parameters to be estimated, and, as noted, eit=vit-uit is a stochastic 
composite error term.  
 

Production, ity , is defined as an implicit quantity index by dividing total olive sales 
in currency units by the olive price index. Vector itx  is defined as a (1 15)  vector that 
contains five inputs. The first input, 1x , includes labor input and is measured in labor 
hours per year, 2x  comprises pesticides, 3x  represents fertilizers, 4x  symbolizes the 
hectares occupied by olive groves, and 5x  comprises variable crop-specific inputs other 
than fertilizers and pesticides. Input use variables 2x , 3x  and 5x  are expressed as 
implicit quantity indices by dividing the consumption of these inputs in currency units 
by their respective price indices.  

 
Given that the Battese and Coelli (1995) model does not really exploit the nature of 

panel data, an alternative method are used to overcome such a limitation. A restricted 
version of the fixed effects technique is used by incorporating regional dummies into 
the production technology function (Álvarez and Orea, 2004 and Lambarraa et al., 
2007). The use of regional dummies assumes that farms are heterogeneous across 



 5

regions, while homogeneity is assumed within regions only for unobserved variables. 
Specifically, we used 5 dummy variables to identify the different Spanish regions.  

 
The technical inefficiency effects function is specified as a linear 

function

a workforce composition  2z which is computed as the ratio of family labor hours to 
total labor hours, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the holding is renting agricultural land 
and zero otherwise  3z , the age of the holding’s primary decision maker  4z , time 
 5z , farm size  6z expressed in European Size Unit (ESU), and payment ratio 
 7z which is computed as the ratio of LFA subsidies about total subsides. Maximum- 
likelihood methods are applied in model estimation. 
 

Rental land is expected to increase farm’s efficiency (Lambarraa et al., 2007). 
Direct costs of land rentals may create stronger incentives to work the land in a more 
efficient manner, relative to the opportunity costs borne by owned land. A farmer’s age 
is also likely to influence technical efficiency. Younger farmers should be expected to 
be more prone to introduce changes in farm management techniques that increase 
efficiency, relative to elderly ones (Battese and Coelli, 1995). The variable time is also 
expected to influence technical efficiency. Since farm managers are likely to learn from 
their errors, the passage of time should be expected to improve technical efficiency 
(Battese and Coelli, 1995). To the extent that family labour is more relevant in small, 
less competitive farms, it may be associated to a higher level of inefficiency (Lambarraa 
et al., 2007 and 2009). Family size is expected to increase farms technical efficiency 
(e.g. Gianakas et al., 2003; Alvarez and Arias, 2004 and Tsionas, 2006). While, 
subsidies are expected to have negative impact about technical efficiency (e.g. 
Bezlepkina et al., 2005, Kleinhanß et al., 2007, and Lambarraa et al., 2009). Results 
derived from the estimation of the model are presented in the following section.  

 
4. RESULTS 

 
Summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis are given in Table 1. 

This table shows that sample farms' average annual output totals around 26,379.38 €. 
Table 1 also indicates that sample farms employ 3,022 labour hours per year, 79% of 
which are family labour. They spent by year 1,424 € for fertilizers, 1,448 for pesticides 
and 3,829 as other crop specific cost by. Sample farms have, on average, 25.13 ha of 
land, of which 8% is rented. The farms size expressed in European Size Unit (ESU) is 
about 30. The average farmer's age in the sample is 57 years.

Results derived from simultaneously estimating the Translog production frontier 

and the technical inefficiency equation are presented in Table 2. The variance 
parameter, γ, is statistically significant which suggests the relevance of technical 
inefficiency in explaining output variability among Spanish LFA area olive farms. 
Estimated   coefficients provide an explanation of the determinants of sample farms’ 
technical inefficiency. As expected, the coefficient representing a farmer’s age is 
positive and statistically significant for both models which suggests that young farmers 
are more efficient in comparison to older ones. Thus, younger farmers may be more 
likely to introduce efficiency-improving changes in their holdings relative to aged ones. 
Farms renting land are shown to be more efficient relative to farms owning cultivated 
land. This provides evidence that land rental costs motivate more efficient operations 
relative to the opportunity costs of owned land.  

 
The workforce composition shows that farms with a higher proportion of family 

labour and not receiving payment are more efficient relative to the farms with a higher 
proportion of remunerated work. The negative coefficient for the variable time in the 
case of the model representing farms not receiving payment suggests that the technical 
efficiency of those farms tended to increase throughout the period studied. This result 
suggests that farm managers not receiving subsidies learn from their errors and 
experience, and has an optimal allocation of managerial effort. For the farms located in 
LFA but receiving payment, the results shows that technical inefficiency of those farms 
has been decreasing over time. This provides evidence that farmers receiving payment 
does not improve their efficiency levels with the passage of time.  

 
The impact of subsidies on technical efficiency is analyzed through the payment 

ratio coefficient. The results show a significant negative impact of subsidies on the 
technical efficiency of LFA Spanish olive farms. Specifically, LFA payment seems to 
have had a relevant negative effect on the technical efficiency level of Spanish olive 
farms. This result is compatible with reduced motivation to produce efficiently as a 
response of farmer’s decision to trade off market income for subsidy income. Other 
studies that analyze the impact of subsidies on technical efficiency of farms located in 
conventional area find similar results (e.g. Lambarraa et al., 2009; Bezlepkina et al., 
2005; Guyomard et al., 2006; Kleinhanß et al., 2007 and Emvalomatis et al., 2008).

The negative impact of LFA payment on farms technical efficiency is explained 

by the fact that subsidies guaranteed a large part of farmer’s income in LFA which 
decrease TE. This decrease is caused by a non-optimal allocation of managerial effort 
which is manifested by sign difference of time coefficient for both models. Thus, 
farmers not receiving LFA payment improve their TE through time, while farms 
receiving LFA payment doesn’t. 

 
Results on technical efficiency distribution by year and interval in both cases are 

presented in Table 3. As we can see, the evolution of TE by year shows an upper TE 
average level for farms not receiving payment along years. The difference of TE 
average level between both farms (receiving and not) fluctuate from a minimum of 8 
points to a maximum of 22 points registered in 2003, in all case a higher level of 
technical efficiency is registered at level of farms that doesn’t receive payment. 
Moreover, such distribution shows that 68% of farms that do not receive payments are 



 8

concentrated in high TE interval level (>60 %), while just 40% of farms that receive 
payment are present in these interval. Estimated average efficiency levels for sample 
farms receiving payment are about 52.6% while for those not receiving payment are 
66.2%.

5. CONCLUSION 

 
Spanish LFA presents more than 80% of total utilized agriculture area. The olive 

sector is one of the main farming activities mostly located in these areas. Given the 
relevance of this sector in the Spanish agriculture and the prominent position of Spanish 
production and exportation worldwide, the relative technical efficiency has been 
analyzed of Spanish olive farms located in LFA. Specifically, this paper assesses the 
impacts of LFA compensatory payment on technical efficiency of Spanish olive farms. 
A stochastic frontier model was estimated using a two unbalanced panel data of 162 
olive farms observed from 2000 to 2004, which 99 farms receive the LFA payment 
support.  

 
Estimated average efficiency levels for sample farms are about 52.6% for farms 

receiving payment and 66.2% for farms do not. Parameters of technical inefficiency 
equation suggest that several variables affect efficiency levels, but do not have the same 
impact in both cases. Technical efficiency scores seem to be positively correlated with 
farms’ size, age of manager, while, the farm rents cultivated land decrease it. On the 
other hand, workforce composition shows that farms with a higher proportion of family 
labour and not receiving payment are more efficient relative to the farms with a higher 
proportion of remunerated work.  

 
Result also suggests that farm managers which not receive compensatory 

allowance learn from their errors and experience, and has an optimal allocation of 
managerial effort. Such results are supported by the negative sign of payment ratio 
coefficient, which provides a negative direct impact of LFA aid scheme on technical 
efficiency of LFA olive farms. Finally, the LFA aid scheme applied during the 2000-
2004 has had a negative impact on technical efficiency of olive farms located in these 
areas.
