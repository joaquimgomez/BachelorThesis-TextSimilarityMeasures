Explaining Low Farm-Gate Prices in the 

Catalan Wine Sector  

 
 

 

Abstract 
 
Purpose – The viticulture sector represents a conspicuous part of the Catalan 
agricultural and agro food sector. While wine production in Catalonia has been 
increasing markedly over the first half of the 2000s, prices that grape producers 
receive have steadily declined threatening their standard of living. This has raised 
social and political concerns and calls for a better understanding of its causes. Our 
analysis attempts to comprehend the sources of such price crisis. 
Methodology – A Delphi survey was conducted during 2005 among a panel of 27 
wine sector experts.  
Findings – We find that experts agree in considering wine surplus and imperfect 
price transmission as the main causes determining low farm-gate prices in the 
Catalan wine sector.  
Keywords: Delphi analysis, wine sector, price transmission.  
Paper type: research paper.

Introduction  
 

As is the case with other European countries, the viticulture sector represents a 

conspicuous part of the Catalan agricultural and agro food sector. Wine making is an 

essential part of the economic and social identity of Catalonia and constitutes an 

important aspect of the region’s landscape. While wine production has been increasing 

markedly over the first half of the 2000s, prices that grape producers receive have 

steadily declined threatening their standard of living. The decline in farm-gate prices 

contrasts with the stability of consumer prices. The economic situation of the wine 

sector has raised social and political concerns and calls for a better understanding of its 

causes.  

 

When market mechanisms work smoothly, prices appear to be the main variable 

determining resource allocation, typically paying back marginal production costs. At the 

same time, prices are the primary mechanism by which different levels of the food 

marketing chain are related. The degree to which price changes are transmitted along 

this chain is usually a reflection of the level of competition within the market. Research 

on vertical price transmission within the food marketing chain has repeatedly reported 

imperfections such as asymmetries in this process (Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Serra and 

Goodwin, 2003; Peltzman, 2000). The literature also agrees on the fact that market 

conditions are largely important to understand how market imperfections work. Our 

analysis aims at characterizing the food marketing chain for wine products in Catalonia 

by quantifying the trade flows occurring within this chain. By doing so, we hope to 

provide useful insights concerning the process of price formation. Also, we attempt to 

determine the causes for the relevant increase in wine production within the last years 

and assess to what extent this increase constitutes a problem for the sector.  

 

This study is divided in five main sections. The next section briefly describes the 

Catalan wine sector. Section three presents the methods employed. Section four reports 

the main results. The paper concludes with a summary of the results and the formulation 

of policy recommendations.

The Catalan wine grape production sector 

 

Worldwide, almost 8 million ha are assigned to grape production and as Table 1 

exhibits, the total area has slightly increased during the last decade (by about 0.8%). In 

contrast, the European grape area, which represents about 44% of worldwide grape area, 

has decreased by approximately 4% in the 1999-2006 period. Following the same trend, 

the Spanish grape production area has declined by around 0.5%. The Spanish grape 

sector is important as it represents about 34% of all European grape production area, 

with almost 1.2 million hectares. Previous studies suggest that the European and 

worldwide wine grape markets qualify as being saturated and mature (Calderon and 

Blanco, 2005; ICEX, 2006).

Catalonia represents roughly 5% -63,000 ha- of the Spanish grape production area 

(Table 1). Although the Catalan grape area is not especially relevant in magnitude, it is 

in quality. The Catalan viticulture sector is clearly specialized in quality wines, with 

around 95% of the vineyard area being devoted to produce “Quality Wine Produced in 

Specific Region” (Q.W.P.S.R.). Among Catalan quality vineyards it is possible to 

identify as much as eleven Protected Designations of Origin[1] (PDOs). Among them 

Penedès is the most prominent in terms of vineyard area, production and sales.

Annual Catalan wine production is around 3 million hectoliters, a 9% of Spanish 

wine production (Table 1). PDOs represent around 90% of Catalan wine production. 

Despite a slight decline in output in 2001, especially for PDOs, a considerable increase 

takes place in the subsequent years. Catalan wine production patterns by PDO have 

changed over time. While PDO Penedès, Costers del Segre and Empordà have increased 

their relative importance, PDO Tarragona, Conca de Barberà and Terra Alta have lost 

relevance (Table 2). About 70% of the wine produced in Catalonia is devoted to white 

wine, a fact that can be explained by the relevance of Cava production (sparkling white 

wine) in Catalonia. Consistently with the evolution of total wine production, both white 

and red wine output increased during the first half of the 2000s.

Trends in consumption show a different pattern as Figure 1 illustrates. Although 

worldwide consumption has increased since the end of the 1990s (OIV), Spanish wine 

consumption has decreased and concentrated on PDO wines. Catalan wine consumption 

has experienced a much softer decrease and has also focused on PDO wines. Moreover, 

Spanish consumption is more centered on non Catalan PDOs such as Rioja and Ribera 

del Duero (AcNielsen, 2006a and b). Another remarkable issue arising from Figure 1 is 

that Catalan production exceeds consumption by far.

“Take in Figure 1” 

 

The fact that production surpasses consumption explains the positive Catalan wine 

trade balance. In particular, wine imports within the last years (1999-2005) have been 

around 38 million euros, whereas exports have represented about 340 million euros 

(Cámaras de Comercio, 2007). Currently, however, exports are growing more slowly 

than imports. This can be explained by changing consumer preferences and increased 

competition from other countries. Catalonia imports mainly from France, Portugal, 

Italy, Chile and Germany and exports to Germany, the USA, the UK and Sweden.  

 

The excess production over consumption together with an increase in imports has 

had clear effects on prices. While consumer prices have not experienced noteworthy 

changes, farm-gate prices have significantly declined (Figure 2). This is consistent with 

Bukenya and Labys (2007) who confirmed a weak relationship between Spanish wine 

prices and wine inventories. The fact that a reduction in farm-gate prices does not 

translate into lower prices for wine, suggests the existence of imperfect price 

transmission within the food marketing chain (Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Serra and 

Goodwin, 2003; Peltzman, 2000). It may also suggest a scenario of inelastic demand 

and supply curves for wine (Fogarty, 2004). In such a scenario, the lower costs of grape 

production may not result in a reduction in wine prices. That is, the margin enjoyed by 

downstream channel members may automatically rise.  

 

Paradoxically, low grape prices have not involved a reduction in grape production, 

which would have contributed to re-equilibrate the market. On the contrary, producers 

seem to have responded to low market prices by increasing output levels. This is 

consistent with producers aiming at stabilizing their income. Fogarty (2004) stated that 

countries with higher per capita levels of wine consumption and higher relative market 

shares have a more inelastic demand, being France, Spain, Portugal and Germany the 

most relevant examples. The decline in farm-gate prices coupled with inelastic demand 

and supply curves for wine has squeezed wine grape growers’ margins and threatens 

their standard of living.

Spanish wine grape growers’ family farm income diminished from about 1,045 €/ha 

in 2003 to 685€/ha in 2005 (MAPA, n.d.). Aggregate Spanish data are considered 

representative of the Catalan pattern, as the economic situation during the period studied 

was quite similar in all Spanish regions. Our analysis aims to improve the understanding 

of the reasons that have led to the present crisis situation, as well as the causes that 

justify an imperfect price transmission within the marketing chain. To do so, it is 

important to better comprehend the overall functioning of the food chain and identify 

the causes of production increases during the first half of the 2000s. A Delphi survey is 

used to assess these issues. 

 

“Take in Figure 2” 

 

Data and methods  

 

As noted above, in a perfectly competitive market, the price of the final product 

should result from adding the marginal costs incurred by agents at each level of the 

marketing chain. However, market imperfections such as information asymmetry, 

market power, menu costs and search costs in local markets (Serra and Goodwin, 2003) 

may lead to imperfect transmission of prices along the chain. In agricultural markets 

this has been reported to be a serious concern. The recent evolution of wine grapes and 

wine prices suggest that imperfect price transmission may also be present within the 

Catalan wine marketing chain. 

 

In order to gain a better understanding of price formation, it is necessary to have a 

deeper knowledge of the overall functioning of the marketing chain. Since there are no 

available statistical data on this issue, the Delphi method has been considered 

particularly relevant in providing the required information. The Delphi method has been 

successfully applied to examine different issues in a large variety of disciplines such as 

health (Milholland et at., 1973; Schoeman and Mahajan, 1977; and Oranga and 

Nordberg, 1993), policy (Critcher and Gladstone, 1998), and agriculture. In this latter 

discipline, the Delphi method has been used to examine Spanish olive oil exports (Mili 

and Rodríguez, 2001)[2], the marketing of organic products (Padel and Midmore, 2005), 

the Finnish agricultural policy (Rikkonen et al., 2006) or the biotechnology and agro-

food sector (Agrafiotis and Vagianou-Angelaki, 1999).

The Delphi survey technique was first introduced in the early 1950’s and was 

initially oriented to deal with technical topics such as reaching a consistent opinion for a 

complex issue (Turoff, 2002). Rather than an objective method to measure effects and 

causes of a specific phenomenon, it provides qualitative information that cannot be 

elicited through other methods. The objective of the Delphi analyses carried out is to 

reveal all the possible reasons that could explain current low farm-gate prices within the 

Catalan wine sector by achieving a consensus among experts (Turoff, 2002).  

 

The survey was performed during 2005. The selection of the panel was acomplished 

following expert advice. The Polytechnic University of Catalonia has long been 

involved with studying the Catalan wine sector. Faculty and extension specialists were 

consulted and provided a list of agents. Experts on the wine sector from the Department 

of Agriculture of the Catalan Government also provided a directory of possible 

respondents. From these lists, we selected a final panel of 27 experts, all of them 

professionals belonging to different levels of the wine supply chain (wine grape 

growers, wineries, wholesalers and retailers). We also selected professionals from the 

Catalan agricultural public administration, regulatory councils and the University.  

 

Three rounds were enough to obtain both the information needed as well as to 

increase the degree of consensus among experts. As for the first round, a preliminary 

questionnaire was sent and returned by mail. After this first reply, a second 

questionnaire was developed and completed also by mail. Finally, a third phase was 

carried out by means of expert face to face interviews, in order to contrast the results 

obtained in the second step. Respondents included about 63% of the panel and 

represented all supply chain stages, public authorities and the University.  

 

The first-round survey was based on open questions aiming to identify the main 

problems related to the sector. Based on the reported replies the second Delphi 

questionnaire was built. This second-round consisted of a closed questionnaire where 

the respondents were asked to carry out quantitative and qualitative evaluations of 

different issues in order to better define and make suggestions to solve the main 

problems identified in the first round. Finally, second-round replies were ordered and 

structured using a third-round where respondents were presented with the obtained 



 7

results and offered the chance to change their responses according to the information 

available. To determine a stopping criterion for the Delphi analysis, we measure 

stability of respondents over successive rounds of the Delphi following the method 

proposed by (Sheibe et al., 2002). This method consists of comparing the distributions 

of opinion between rounds. A maximum of a 15% change level is chosen to represent a 

state of equilibrium. Since no significant change levels in third-round responses were 

observed, a fourth questionnaire appeared as unnecessary.    

 

Results and discussion  

 

a. First Round: Main wine sector problems expert assessment.   

 

Since the wine supply chain is slightly complex and in order to gain a deeper 

understanding of the problems affecting the sector, in the first-round experts were 

inquired about the specific problems related to the different stages of wine production. 

In particular, they were questioned about the problems regarding wine grape growing, 

wine production, the structure of the sector, wine marketing within the domestic market, 

wine exports and, finally, other general problems. Results are presented in Table 3.  

 

Respondents identify the lack of payment differentiation between grapes for PDO 

and non-PDO wines as being the main problem related to grape production, likely to be 

originated by over-production of grapes for PDO wines. Other deficiencies related to 

the national vineyard restructuring plan, a supply management policy, are identified. 

Experts consider inadequate restructuring schedules and grape varieties as the main 

shortcomings related to this plan. Finally, respondents believe that the Common 

Agricultural Policy (CAP), in its present form, is unable to preserve supply-demand 

equilibrium. 

 

The utilization of concentrated and rectified grape must is one of the main problems 

of wine production, and it may allow middlemen in the marketing chain to pay reduced 

prices for wine grapes. Increases in wine imports follow in relevance amplifying the 

excess supply problem. As exhibited in Table 3, the main structural deficiencies of the 

wine sector are a lack of interprofessional agreements, a low degree of vertical 

integration, and an insufficient entrepreneurial dimension for international competition. 



 8

Moreover, respondents believe that there exist too many intermediaries within the wine 

supply chain and that margins within the chain are excessive.  

 

Wine marketing within national markets suffers from four main problems: 

restaurants’ high margins and prices, hard competition from other Spanish and 

international wines, low and seasonal demand for Catalan wines both in Catalonia and 

in Spain and finally poor national marketing structures. Another shortcoming is the 

existence of too many Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) in Catalonia. The fact 

that Catalan wines are not sold under a common quality brand makes it more difficult 

the commercialization in Spain and in foreign countries relative to other Spanish PDOs 

such as Rioja comprising wider production areas. Barrère (2007) identifies that in 

Spain, Italy and France competition and segmentation is basically among PDO wines 

instead of between PDO and other wines. Therefore, the main objective of this 

certification, differentiation by quality, loses significance.  

 

Finally, export limitations are also identified in Table 3. The low promotion of 

Catalan wines in foreign markets represents, according to experts, the main shortcoming 

affecting the sector which is related to the lack of collaborative agreements among 

different PDOs. Poor market structures, a slow down in export expansion and lack of 

knowledge of foreign markets have also been considered by experts as key problems for 

international wine marketing.  

 

First-round survey results identified three main reasons that have induced a decline 

in farm prices while consumer prices remain constant: excess production, deficient 

marketing structures and imperfect price transmission along the marketing chain. In 

order to gain a deeper understanding of these problems a second-round Delphi 

questionnaire was designed. As for excess production, we directly inquire experts on the 

issue. With regards to price transmission and marketing structures we characterize the 

marketing chain so as to identify possible causes of why prices are not moving 

smoothly.

wines which follow different production processes and have different marketing chains. 

To that end, in the questionnaire a supply chain diagram with empty data was included 

in order to be completed (see Figures 3 and 4). Experts were asked to determine the 

percentage of output flowing to each different agent in each marketing level. According 

to their answers, wine supply chains can be characterized as follows.  

 

Catalan young red (white) wine is made from about 90% (88%) Catalan wine grape 

and 10% (12%) concentrated grape juice.  A 17% (19%) of this red (white) young wine 

will be diverted towards the production of non-PDO wines. Our panel of experts 

estimate that non-PDO red (white) wine produced in Catalonia is a blend of about 75% 

(79%) Catalan young wine and 25% (21%) from other origins. On the other hand, about 

83% (81%) of Catalan young red (white) wine is devoted to the production of PDO. 

From this, more than a 30% of the red wine is directed to an aging process and the 

remaining is consumed as bottled young wine with PDO. As for white wine, about a 

30% goes to an aging process, 18% is consumed as bottled young wine with PDO and 

the remaining 59% goes towards Cava (sparkling wine) production. 

 

“Take in Figures 3 and 4” 

 

On the basis of expert responses, it can be concluded that the Catalan red wine 

industry produces four key products: bulk wine without PDO (8%), bottled wine 

without PDO (13%), bottled young wine with PDO (54.5%) and finally aged wine with 

PDO (24.5%). On the other hand, the Catalan white wine yields five key products: bulk 

non-PDO wine (10%), bottled PDO and non-PDO young wine (18 % and 9% 

respectively), Cava (59%) and finally aged wine qualified as PDO (4%). 

 

Moreover, it seems clear that there are four main wine market destinations both for 

red and white wines. As we can see in Table 4, exports represent around 30-40% of total 

production in the region, domestic supermarket distribution represent about a 30%,  

while around 25% of Catalan wine is consumed in restaurants and more than 10% is 

sold in wine stores.

From both red and white wine diagrams, it is worth mentioning the quantity of wine 

that is redirected from non-PDO to PDO wine. Approximately 23% (25%) of red 

(white) wine that initially enters the non-PDO wine marketing chain is readdressed 

towards the production of PDO wine. This contributes to our understanding of the 

observed price behavior: while a portion of grapes enter the distribution channel as non-

PDO and thus receive lower prices than PDO grapes, they are finally used to produce 

PDO wines that will obtain higher retail prices. 

 

It is also important to emphasize the role of cooperatives within the Catalan wine 

sector. Following expert quantifications, around half of Catalan grape production is 

controlled by cooperatives. While cooperatives play an undoubtedly relevant role, 

affiliation in the wine sector is lower relative to other food products and countries. For 

example, almost 70% of the milk produced within the EU-15 is marketed through 

cooperatives (Foro Agrario, 2000). In 2003, four of the ten main European cooperatives, 

in terms of revenue, specialized in dairy. In contrast, no wine cooperative existed within 

the raking (Confederación General de Cooperativas Agrarias de la UE-COGECA, 

2005). The situation is not much different in Spain, where fruits, vegetables and olive 

oil cooperatives are abundant while wine cooperatives are scarce (COGECA, 2005).  

Spain had 625 wine cooperatives in 2003, not much compared to the 900 located in 

France, a direct competitor of Spain. Moreover, French cooperatives’ turnover per year 

is almost twice that of Spanish ones (COGECA, 2005).  

 



 12

Catalonia has around 77 wine cooperatives, which is 12% of all Spanish wine 

cooperatives (MAPA, 2004).  This is compatible with Catalan wine production, 

representing around 10% of Spanish production.  Low cooperative market shares 

coupled with an overall lack of marketing contracts within the wine sector involve 

reduced farmer negotiating power in price determination. Cooperatives can play a key 

role in marketing agricultural products by providing growers with a common database 

and by achieving economies of scale and thus lowering marketing and promotion costs. 

There is indeed a good experience with regards to cooperatives in the Catalan wine 

sector. The PDO Montsant, which was born in 2001, has been mainly promoted through 

cooperativism. Thanks to promotion strategies, the quality of Montsant wines is starting 

to be recognized outside Catalonia-almost a 70% of Montsant production is exported 

specially to Germany and the United States. Also in this sense, Garcia et al. (2002) 

explain that, for the Canary Island potato sector, vertical integration in agricultural 

cooperatives contributes to increase producer revenues by granting them participation to 

the added value during the commercialization process. From the expert’s standpoint, 

cooperatives are more relevant within the white wine than within the red wine chain. 

This can explain the higher stability displayed by white wine farm-gate prices relative to 

red wine (see Figure 2).   

 

 Finally, the role of supermarkets on price determination, which have more power 

than the one exerted by small shops and restaurants, must also be considered.  

Excluding exports, supermarkets distribute almost half of Catalan wine. Supermarkets 

may be more reluctant to reprice their products than small specialty shops since the 

costs of doing so are higher. Low farm prices may not be immediately transferred to 

consumers. Consequently, supermarket power may also contribute to explain why retail 

prices have remained more or less constant while farm-gate prices have diminished.  

 

b.2 Qualitative evaluation of the Catalan wine surplus 

 

This section aims to elicit qualitative information on the prospects and situation 

of the Catalan wine sector production surplus. In order to better characterize the 

situation and predict its future evolution, experts were asked to forecast the overall 

economic situation of the sector within the next five years. Moreover, they were also 

asked to qualify the production surplus situation as temporary or permanent. Finally, the 



 13

reasons that encourage excess supply in the Catalan wine sector were also identified 

(Table 5).  

 

With respect to the economic forecast within the next five years, experts agree in 

considering the white wine (60% of experts) and the Cava (more than 70% of the panel) 

sectors as quite stable sectors. However, some respondents point to moderate expansion 

or recession. In particular, around  20% (10%) of the panel believes that the Cava (white 

wine) sector will expand, while less than 10% (30%) predicts a recession. Agreement 

among experts is lower with regards to the economic forecast of the red wine sector. 

About 33% of the panel foresees a moderate expansion in the next future, 33% believes 

that the sector is stable, 20% predicts a moderate recession and finally a 13% foresees 

an important recession.[3] 

 

A majority of panel members (around 60%) define the current production 

surplus situation as permanent for white and red wines, more than 30% as structural and 

only 6% as temporary. There is, however, no agreement for the case of Cava: about 

29% of the panel considers the situation as being temporary, 39% as structural with a 

possible solution and finally 32% as permanent. Furthermore, experts consider it easier 

to deal with white wine than red wine surplus, since the first can be redirected -in bulk- 

to other European wine markets, reducing white wine stocks.   

 

Finally, we elicited from experts the causes of Catalan wine surplus 

differentiating between red wine, white wine and cava. A list of possible causes were 

presented to the experts and they rateed each proposition from 0 – not at all important to 

10 – very important. Table 5 presents the top ten surplus causes according to expert 

assessment. Interestingly, there was an agreement among expert panel members that the 

origins of production surplus are the lack of coordination and poor vertical integration 

in the overall Catalan wine sector.

Excessive production due to soft supply regulation and the inability of the 

Common Market Organization (CMO) for wine to preserve market equilibrium are also 

considered as possible reasons for wine surplus. Other regulation-related causes are 

identified, such as low support from the government towards the wine sector and low 

public control of cooperatives and cellar management to ensure good oenological 

practices. Furthermore, export market limitations have also been highlighted by experts 

as a reason for wine surplus. Indeed, survey respondents reveal that the Catalan export 

marketing strategy is not effective enough and encounters difficulties when competing 

against other low-price quality wines such as Australian, Argentinean and Chilean 

wines. Finally, the tendency to increase production in response to price declines so as to 

maintain farm income has also been considered as an important factor. 

 

Discussion and conclusions 

 

The Catalan wine sector is currently immersed in a crisis situation characterized by 

excess production and low farm-gate prices. The tendency of farm-gate prices to decline 

contrasts with the stability displayed by consumer prices. This study has attempted to 

determine the underlying causes of this situation. Catalonia is one of the main European 

PDO wine producing areas and the evidence presented in this analysis can provide some 

insights relevant for further empirical and theoretical analysis. It is however important 

to note that since this paper is based on qualitative data, all the findings should be 

treated as indicative not conclusive. Further validation through large-scale surveys 

would be interesting for future research. Closely following the evolution of the wine 

sector during the next few years would help determine the future relevancy of our 

results and policy recommendations.  

 

First-round results from the Delphi study agree in considering excess production, 

deficient marketing structures and imperfect price transmission as the main causes 

determining low farm-gate prices in the Catalan wine sector. The second and third 

rounds of the analysis were carried out to provide a deeper understanding of both the 

motivating causes of excess production and the overall functioning of the marketing 

chain.   

 



 16

Results show that although marketing chains for white and red wines are different, 

they present similar characteristics that suggest the existence of imperfect vertical price 

transmission. Specifically, while a portion of grapes are purchased and enter the 

distribution channel as wine grapes for non-PDO wines, they are later redirected 

towards the production of PDO wine. Also, the role of cooperatives, though relevant in 

absolute terms is smaller relative to other food sectors. These facts, coupled with the 

significant role played by supermarkets that usually exert strong market power, 

contribute to help understand why farm-gate prices decline while consumer prices 

remain stable.  

 

Other causes are identified by experts in the first-round qualitative assessment as 

causing imperfect price transmission along the marketing chain. These causes are the 

scarce development of contractual regimes among agents, poor vertical integration and 

abnormal margins among certain distributors. Moreover, experts reveal that, even 

though the public administration is aware of these problems, efforts put forward to help 

the sector to prevent them are very limited.  

 

Qualitative results from the Delphi study allow us to point to the main causes 

responsible for the current production surplus affecting the sector: the lack of 

coordination and poor market integration in the overall Catalan wine sector, deficiencies 

in the public regulation of the sector, a slow down in exports and domestic sales and 

finally an increase in production so as to maintain farm income levels in a context of 

price declines. Interestingly, experts identify this situation as being a structural 

phenomenon for white and red wine, whilst for Cava it seems to be only a temporary 

condition. Moreover, experts are more concerned about red than white wine due to the 

bulk-export possibility for the latter.   

 

Based on the results from the Delphi survey, several policy and managerial 

implications emerge. It seems interesting to implement polices that help to improve 

integration for all stages of wine production, from grape growing to wine selling. This 

implies reducing the number of intermediaries and promoting a high level of 

professionalization within the sector. Vertical integration may help to reduce margin 

concentration at certain levels of the marketing chain. It would also be useful to 

standardize the parameters that are taken into account to define the quality of grapes by 



 17

wine makers, and to promote the economic compensation for quality production. This 

latter measure could induce a reduction in overproduction.  

 

The slow down in demand both at the national and international levels seems to be a 

result of poor knowledge of Catalan wines which limits the chances to introduce them 

in foreign markets. Some experts argue in favor of promoting an agreement among 

PDOs regarding promotional strategies along with supports from public authorities. 

This would imply less competition among PDOs, more consumer information about 

Catalan wines and thus a likely increase in domestic consumption and/or exports.  

 

 Moreover, the impending EU wine market reform can help reducing overproduction 

since it will ban the use of sugar for enriching wine. This will have a positive impact on 

quality payment differentiations and is likely to reduce overproduction. Also, better 

labelling rules and a budget for promoting information campaigns for wines with 

Geographical Indications is likely to positively affect grape for PDO wine payments. 

However, the elimination of market management measures, such as crisis distillation 

can have a negative impact on overproduction.  

 

The first limitation of this study is associated with the Delphi method. Implementing 

the Delphi questionnaire is time consuming and this implies that not many rounds can 

be developed. Another important limitation is the lack of transparency within the 

Catalan wine sector, making it complex to extract information from the agents involved 

and limits the availability of experts to participate in the study. Indeed, a bigger expert 

panel would help in making a more accurate diagnosis of the situation of the sector. 

Finally, some of the data required, such as farm-level economic data, are not easily 

available making it even more difficult to gain a deeper understanding of the situation of 

the sector.
