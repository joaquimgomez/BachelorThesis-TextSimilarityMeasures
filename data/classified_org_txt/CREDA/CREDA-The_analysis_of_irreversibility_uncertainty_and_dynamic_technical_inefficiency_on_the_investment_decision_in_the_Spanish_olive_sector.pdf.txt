The analysis of irreversibility, uncertainty and dynamic technical inefficiency on the investment decision in Spanish olive sector

Abstract
We evaluate investment decision making under uncertainty and irreversibility when allowing for long-run inefficiency. Using olive grove farm data from Spain, we estimate a dynamic stochastic frontier model to determine the long-run technical efficiency in the context of a real option approach as we address the decision to invest. This study finds that olive grove investment is irreversible and the investment decision depends on technical inefficiency and its persistence. 
Keywords: Spanish olive sector, investment, dynamic efficiency, real option 

1. Introduction
The olive sector plays an important social, economic and environmental role in the Spanish economy as it encompasses more than 2.58 million hectares[footnoteRef:1] (Spanish Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs MARM, 2012). With most Spanish olive production concentrated in the less-developed areas, this production activity represents an important source of employment and is a significant force of social and economic development strategy in these areas. A further external contribution of olive groves is environmental mitigation such as desertification and loss of biodiversity in the production region. [1:  Spain has a largest area of olive groves and the largest number of olive trees in the World (MARM, 2012)] 

Spain ranks first globally in both olive oil and table olive production and their export. This position is reinforced by a 5.2% increase in olive production area cultivation over the last 7 years (2005-2012) (MARM, 2012).
The olive sector investment is characterized by irreversibility and uncertainty (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). The irreversibility arises from the presence of sunk costs associated with various factors: a) the planting of new orchard, which includes the removal of old trees when necessary, land preparation and new planting material costs, b) the opportunity cost associated with the establishment expense and c) the opportunity cost of the land while the orchard is being established.
The uncertainty is reflected through factors affecting future outcomes and, therefore, farmers’ investment decisions arising from market conditions, regulatory initiatives and constraints, farmer expertise and information access. Consequently, farmers take time before deciding to invest as uncertainty declines, reflecting their managerial ability to revise decisions in response to unexpected market conditions.
An extensive literature applies the real option approach to the agricultural sector (e.g., Purvis et al., 1995; Price and Wetzstein, 1999; Engel and Hyde, 2003; Tauer, 2006; Stokes et al., 2009). This study analyzes Spanish olive sector irreversibility and uncertainty along and the impact of technical[footnoteRef:2] efficiency and its persistence as a relevant force that can impact the investment decision. The persistence of the technical inefficiency impacts inefficiency over the long run term. Following Tsionas (2006), the firms surviving over the long run rely on their level of efficiency which reflects the cost of adjustment of the factors under the influence of firms. The high cost of adjustment in the sector implies persistent technical inefficiency which leads inefficient firms to be driven out of the sector in the absence of corrective action. This model is coupled with the real option approach with the objective to analyse the decision to invest and it flexibility under irreversibility and uncertainty. In a posterior step, the rate of technical efficiency and its persistence are used to evaluate their impact on investment decisions. The measurement of long-run technical inefficiency levels and its persistence contributes to the evaluation of the sustainability of farms over time and the adjustment factors and forces leading to technical inefficiency.  [2:  An allocative efficiency analysis is precluded given the absence of firm-specific prices.

The next section reviews the literature concerning dynamic efficiency and the real options approach followed by the presentation of the methodological approach. The following section discusses the econometric specification and the empirical application followed by the discussion of main results. The final section presents some concluding comments.

2. Background and literature review
While the majority of traditional stochastic frontier models tend to estimate frontier functions and firm-specific, time-invariant inefficiency levels (e.g. Schmidt and Sickles, 1984; Kumbhakar, 1987; and Greene, 2008), several stochastic frontier production studies account for dynamics in the context of panel data (e.g. Cornwell et al., 1990; Kumbhakar, 1990; Battese and Coelli, 1992; Lee and Schmidt, 1993 and Ahn and Schmidt, 1995). The latter models aim to estimate the temporal pattern of time series variation in firm efficiency levels, and represent the technical efficiency as constant over time[footnoteRef:3].  [3:  An exception is Lee and Schmidt (1993) who use a nonlinear model permitting an arbitrary pattern of temporal change in technical inefficiency. However, such model is criticized for imposing arbitrary restrictions on the short-run dynamic efficiency levels and their incompatibility with the analysis of long-run dynamics on technical inefficiency.] 

The dynamic stochastic frontier models tend to estimate firms’ long-run technical inefficiency levels, given the pressure on a firm’s ability to remain competitive in the long run unless they are technically efficient. Tsionas (2006) proposes that the inefficiency factors are adjusted over time which depends implicitly on adjustment costs. The higher the cost of adjustment, the greater the probability of finding evidence of persistent technical inefficiency. 
As we address the technical efficiency firms employing a technology, the model of investment is a key structural feature of the analysis. The traditional net present value (NPV) approach implicitly ignores management’s flexibility and ability to revise decisions in response to unexpected market developments. Such assumptions are related to the expected scenario of cash flow and presume the certainty of the project. However, decision making environments are characterized by competitive interactions and uncertainty which can arise from internal and external sources. As new information arrives and uncertainty is resolved, the manager has the flexibility to capitalize on favourable future opportunities or mitigate losses (Trigeorgis, 1995). 
Dixit and Pindyck (1994) introduce the irreversibility model and identified the interactions between the irreversible nature of investments in an uncertain future and the timing of those investments. Firm investment in quasi-fixed assets embodies three important characteristics: i) irreversibility, ii) uncertainty, and iii) the optimal timing of investment decisions. Irreversibility refers to the existence of an initial cost of investment that must be at least partially sunk, making the investment partially or completely irreversible. The uncertainty is associated with the future outcomes that can generate uncertain profits. The timing of investment means that it is possible to postpone the investment to acquire more information about the future.
The orchard replacement problem is a classic agricultural case of irreversible investment. Most orchard investment models use a mathematical programming approach to analyse the decision of investment by maximizing the NPV of the orchard as an objective, subject to optimal replacement of trees (Graham et al., 1977; Willis and Hanlon, 1976; Childs et al., 1983; Thiele and Zhang, 1992; Hester and Cacho, 2003). Few models have used the econometric approach with emphasis on uncertainty, adjustment costs and informational imperfections (e.g. Bernstein and Nadiri, 1982). An exception is Dorfman and Heien (1989), who present a model of investment behaviour incorporating uncertainty and adjustment costs through the maximization of the expected present value of almond orchard profits. 
The real option approach to analysing orchard investment is undertaken by Price and Wetzstein (1999), which consider uncertainty on yield and price to analyse irreversible investment decisions in peach orchards. The empirical results depend on the magnitude of the drift and variance of price and output processes, and the correlation between them. The results indicate stability in Georgia peach production, implying that current peach growers remain in production and the potential ones delay investment unless they have the ability to earn enhanced returns.
3. Methodology 
The modeling framework proceeds in two stages.  The dynamic stochastic frontier methodology is presented which permits estimation of the feasible production technology and how technical efficiency evolves over time. This is followed by the real options model which builds on the estimated technology. 

3.1 Dynamic stochastic frontier model: a Bayesian approach
The Bayesian approach can offer several advantages over the classical econometric methods in applied research. It is a useful tool for making inference on efficiencies in stochastic frontier models (e.g., Koop et al., 1994, 1995, 1997). Bayesian inference produces exact finite-sample posterior, predictive distributions and, formal treatment of parameter and model uncertainty (see e.g. Van den Broeck et al., 1994; Fernandez et al., 2003; Kim and Schmidt, 2000). However, the complexity of stochastic frontier models leads inevitably to numerical integration methods, such as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. 
Several applications to stochastic frontier analysis use the Bayesian approach. Van den Broeck et al., (1994), among others, use a sampling technique to obtain the posterior distribution for the Erlang model. More recently, Tsionas (2000, 2002, 2006) and Atkinson and Dorfman (2009) use a Gibbs sampling method developed by Koop et al., (1995) to analyze the case of non-integer shape parameter as a specific case of the gamma distribution. 
Following Tsionas (2006), the stochastic frontier production function with panel data can be expressed as:




	(1)









where and  are a  vector of regressors and parameters, respectively,  is a two-sided random error that is assumed to be iid , i-th firm:  in period  , and  is a non-negative error term representing technical inefficiency.

We assume that technical efficiency follows an autoregressive process:



 for 			(2)



 for  for all 		(3)













where  for  is a random variable capturing the unexpected log-efficiency sources and  for all . The systematic part  reflects expected log-inefficiency sources[footnoteRef:4].  and  are  vectors of covariates and parameters, respectively. Further, we assume that, , and  are independently distributed.  [4:  The parameter ρ indicates the persistence parameter of technical inefficiency. We assume that firms are able to modify systematically a constant percentage of their past-period inefficiency level through dynamic adjustment. Given that the technical inefficiency is caused by factors that are under the influence of firms but these factors cannot be adjusted without costs, the efficiency improvement will necessarily depend on the costs of adjustment. The cost of adjustment in this case is illustrated indirectly in the persistence parameter of the technical inefficiency. ] 


The joint density of the model is given by:


											(4)



where with ,  and similarly for X and Z.



The first component of the joint density in (4) arises from the normality of , the second component arises from the log-normality of , and the last one is due to the lognormal assumption on .

The likelihood function follows from the joint density. Closed form solutions are not available, offering the opportunity to use the Bayesian techniques and the MCMC methods as a means to generate this extremely high-dimensional integral when n or T is large. The Appendix provides more details on this construction.
3.2 Real options methodology



Following Dixit and Pindyck (1994), we assume that the project value  follows a geometric Brownian motion with drift and diffusion, which implies that the current value of the project is known, but the future values are always uncertain according to 


							(5)




where is the increment of a Wiener process with  and . The assumption of V following a geometric Brownian motion is conditioned on the level of technical inefficiency. In principle, the technical efficiency component is not stochastic, but it can be driven by unknown parameters. In the stochastic frontier model, technical inefficiency is combined with the two-sided error specification; thus, the technical inefficiency component by construction can be scaled to behave as a probability density function which is combined with the two-sided error probability density function. This all leads to the common practice of specifying a composed error with a non-zero expectation (e.g., Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000, pp. 74-80). 

Defining the value of the investment opportunity and the objective is to maximize the expected present value:



				(6)





where  is the payoff from investing at time t, denotes the expectation,  is the (unknown) future time that the investment is made, and  is a discount rate. The maximization in (6) is subject to how evolves which is described in (5).






We are interested in how uncertainty () impacts the investment decision. Since evolves stochastically, the problem is to determine the critical value at which it is optimal to invest; i.e., when. The Bellman equation over a time interval, , leads to the total expected return on the investment opportunities, , being equal to its expected rate of capital appreciation: 


					(7)




Using Ito´s Lemma to expand  recognizes the stochastic evolution of . Then the Bellman equation is expressed as the differential equation in :



				(8)




where ,  and  is the dividend rate.

The solution to the Bellman equation leads to the optimal investment trigger value (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994): 


					(9)



The component  is the optimal investment trigger (or threshold) value of the project leading to immediate investment, which accounts for both irreversibility and uncertainty. With V representing the value of the decision, the decision is to either invest now or wait. If the value of the investment opportunity is less than the trigger value, the value consists of both NPV and the option value. When V>H, the strategic value of the investment is given by NPV is (V-K), and there is no value in waiting to invest.
The point of indifference between investing or not investing is the Marshallian trigger value:

4. Empirical application
The analysis of Spanish olive sector investment focuses on three indicators: the gross real investment, the investment rate and the investment spikes. We have used a balanced panel data of 158 olive farms from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), available over the periods 1999-2004.
The gross real investment is defined as purchases minus sales of fixed capital normalized by the price index. We distinguish between total gross real investment for a) land and buildings, b) plants (or trees), and c) machinery and equipment.
Figure 1 presents the evolution of the different types of gross real investments during the sample period, and indicates an oscillating pattern from one year to another. In 2003, we notice an investment peak mainly explained by the increase in machinery and equipment associated to the increase in planting investment.

The lumpiness of investment is measured through time by measuring the presence of an absolute investment spike defined as the investment rate exceeding 20% of the installed capital (Power, 1998)[footnoteRef:5]. Figure 2 represents the evolution of the percentage of farms investment spikes. The incidence of absolute investment spikes fluctuate from 16.2 % in 1999 to 1% in 2004, with a peak in 2001 (39.1%). The 93% of farms with positive investment rate have an investment spike exceeding 20% over the study period.  [5:  Two definitions of investment spikes prevail in the literature; an absolute investment spike being defined and the relative investment spike defined when the investment rate is greater than 2.5 times farm’s median investment.

4.1 Estimation of dynamic stochastic model and the real option simulations 
The farm-level data are augmented input and output price indices are necessary to deflate all monetary variables which are derived from Eurostat (2008) using 1999 as the base year. For the construction of the olive grove investment project, additional data have been obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs, the National Institute of Statistics (INE, Instituto Nacional de Estadística), and published studies (Barranco et al., 2006; MARM, 2010; INE, 2010; Abós et al., 2007; Muñoz-Cobo et al., 2008 and Carbonell, 2008). The sunk cost magnitude reflects the cost of land preparation for planting new trees, which includes: a) removing the old trees when necessary plus other land preparation costs, b) the cost of new planting materials, and, c) the opportunity cost of the establishment expense and the land while the orchard is being established which takes approximately 5 years to realize the initial marketable harvest.
For the first step of the analysis, we use the Cobb-Douglas[footnoteRef:6] functional form: [6:  The translog specification results were not robust, with many coefficients being much less than twice their respective posterior standard errors. In this model, the closed form expression for the likelihood function does not exist with the presence of high-dimensional integrals. This situation presents difficulties in implementing the Bayes factors for model selection.] 


					(11)







where k=1,…,K, production is defined as an implicit quantity index by dividing total olive sales in value by the olive price index;  is defined as a (1x6) vector composed of five inputs; and a time trend (t). Input variables are labor (), defined as total hours spent on farm work, expenditure on fertilizers (), pesticides (), and other inputs farming overhead () (that include mostly machinery and building costs and other minimum costs linked to production activity and other direct inputs). The total area occupied by olive groves defines the land variable. 


The error vector is a (14) vector of covariates, age and farm size, which drive the mean efficiency levels. The older farmers are expected to be less efficient in comparison to younger ones (Stefanou and Saxena, 1988; Battese and Coelli, 1995). The farm size is represented by the log of total area and its square (e.g. Giannakas et al., 2003; Alvarez and Arias, 2004 and Tsionas, 2006), since scale effects may be important in explaining technical efficiency. 
For the second step of the analysis, the investment decision is addressed using the real option approach. For the empirical application, a capital budgeting model is developed for an olive investment project following a 50-year planning horizon[footnoteRef:7] (Barranco et al., 2006). The cash flow and present value of the project have been calculated. The olive production variable is simulated using the logistic growth function. We used the FADN data set for production value as well as plantating trees cost. Additional data have been obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs and the Statistical National Institute (INE). [7:  Because of the alternating nature of olive grove production with a high production year followed by a low production year and to more accurately reflect its volatility, the time period is defined by two years long (the good production year plus the bad production year).] 

We specify an AR(1) process impacting the technical efficiency function to address the persistence of inefficiency and then its impact on production. As such, this simulation model is used to relate the dynamic inefficiency and the investment decision.
For this reason, the technical inefficiency and its persistence are included in the production variable used in the simulation model by using (2) and (3). Given that we evaluate the impact of the technical efficiency changes and persistence percentages increase on investment decision, both parameters are introduced using the trigger value in the simulation model. The incorporation[footnoteRef:8] of these variables into the investment project allows the evaluation of their impact in the investment decision. [8:  We use the production variable that is considered as the main component of the NPV to introduce the technical inefficiency rate and its persistence in the simulation process. To evaluate the effect of TE on NPV we use the definition of the technical efficiency as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output.  While, for the impact of the persistence parameter on the investment decision, we use the equations (2) and (3) from the dynamic stochastic frontier model to predict a series of, and later the standard estimate  to introduce TE (and then the values of ) in the NPV for the simulation process.

Before starting the simulation, a distribution is fitted for each variable using three statistical tests: Anderson-Darling, Chi-square, and, Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Price, discount rate, and technical efficiency are assumed to have a lognormal distribution. Table 1 provides the mean and the distribution of the uncertain variables used in the simulation model.

5. Results and discussion

The results derived from the estimation of the dynamic stochastic frontier model are presented in Table 2. First-order parameters of labor, fertilizer, and other inputs are all positive and indicating that the production is increasing in such inputs. The coefficient associated with pesticide is negative and has a negligible magnitude and not statistically negligible.
Land is negative which is not an unusual result in such cases, given that it is a fixed input and cannot be adjusted in orchard crops[footnoteRef:9]. The time trend is negative suggesting that the technology embodied in the trees is unchanged. Therefore, any growth taking place over time is from the installed trees. [9:  Acquiring land is highly inflexible as a farm owner waits to hectares to come on the market, which can be a very rare event. Hence, this can encourage holding land beyond it marginal productive value from a production analysis point of view. In addition, olive production is characterised by biannual production patterns (that is, extremely low output followed by the high output years). As such, a negative coefficient on land can arise.
] 

The estimation results of the gamma component reveals that technical inefficiency increases at a decreasing rate for larger farms. The posterior mean for the autoregressive component is 0.294 which is fairly small and far from unity suggesting that a small quantity of technical inefficiency is transmitted to the next time period and, thus, there is not as much friction of inefficiency over time. Tsionas (2006) and Emvalomatis et al. (2011) both find a persistence component close to 1 for the case of US banking and European dairy farming, respectively. Our result indicates that the technical inefficiency of Spanish olive farms are minimally persistent, leading to a lower cost of adjustment as well as not as much competition in this sector. This result can be explained by the nature of olive production characterised by higher oscillation from one year to the other comparing to inputs changes which leads to high inefficiency level in the low production year and low inefficiency level in the high production year. This oscillation produces a very low value of the persistence component.

The distribution of estimated technical efficiency scores by farm for the static (short run) ranges between 65.6% and 83.7%, averaging 8.1% throughout the period studied. The majority of farmers have efficiency scores in the range 70-80% (82% of the sample), followed by the range 80-90% (16% of the sample). Technical efficiency fluctuates over time from a peak of 91.1% in 1999 to a minimum of 72.6% in 2003. 
The measure for dynamic (long-run) predicted technical efficiency ranges from 39.4% to 76.5%, and with an average value of 72.7% through the sample period. The vast majority of olive farms in the sample have dynamic efficiency scores in the range 70-80%, accounting for 81.7% of the total sample. The range 60-70% represents 15.8% of the total sample. Comparing the static and the dynamic models finds similar results with the static inefficiency being 0.06 percentage units greater compared to the dynamic frontier model. This is consistent with the low persistence inefficiency, which indicates that most farms are keeping efficiency at the same level from the short- to the long-term. 
Table 4 presents the NPV, option value and trigger value found by varying the discount rate. The results indicate that a decrease in the discount rate leads to an increase on the option value and thus the decision to invest. When the discount rate is 8% (the higher value) the decision is to delay investing, while a decrease in the discount rate value generates a decrease of the trigger value motivating farmers to take the decision to invest.

Uncertainty in price combined with discount rate play an important role on the decision to invest in the Spanish olive sector. Table 5 shows the simulation results by varying olive price and discount rate. At a lower discount rate level (7%), a price increase leads to the decision to invest with no option value of waiting to invest. Moreover, a lower price increase (5-10%) combined with a higher discount rate (8%) delays the investment decision in the Spanish olive sector. The situation changes when the discount rate decreases, suggesting that the price increase encourages farmers to take the decision to invest.

Table 6 presents the effect of dynamic technical inefficiency and its persistence on investment decision. The technical efficiency rate is inversely related to the option value for waiting to invest. Thus, technical inefficiency increases the option value of waiting to invest and therefore delays the investment decision, while being technically efficient leads to farmers being more decisive about the investment decision.

Alternatively, the NPV, the option value and the trigger value for olive investments under alternative technical inefficiency persistence changes as presented in Table 7. As the persistence of technical inefficiency increases the decision is to wait to invest, and under a small percentage change in the persistence of technical inefficiency the decision is to invest.

 An increase in the persistence parameter of technical inefficiency leads the farmers to wait to invest. This result can be explained by the higher costs of adjustment combined with the strong competition in the sector. However, with a small estimated persistence parameter of technical inefficiency, the decision is to invest.

6. Concluding comments

This study addresses investment decision under uncertainty and irreversibility allowing for long-run inefficiency and its persistent impact on investment decisions. This analysis has been applied to a 158 Spanish olive farms using farm-level records from the FADN database. The dynamic stochastic frontier model based on the autoregressive term of technical inefficiency reflects an element of the adjustment cost, which leads to analyzing investment under uncertainty and irreversibility using the real option approach.
The empirical results show that the technical inefficiency persistence parameter is fairly low to unity, implying that small technical inefficiency is transmitted to the next time period. The technical efficiency average is 72.7% and the static inefficiency is 0.06 percentage points greater than dynamic technical efficiency.
Olive grove investment is irreversible and characterized by uncertainty on price and discount rate that play an important role on the decision to invest in the Spanish olive sector. An increase in the discount rate leads farmers to postpone investment. An increase on price along with a decrease of discount rate leads to the decision to invest with no option value of waiting to invest.
The results also suggest that the decision of investment in Spanish olive sector does not depend alone on discount rate and olive price, but also on technical inefficiency and it persistence. An increase in a farm’s inefficiency leads to the decision to wait to invest and, conversely, the more technically efficient the farmer, the more likely the decision is to invest. Consequently, inefficient farmers postpone investment, while a smaller persistence parameter leads to the decision to invest. The investment in Spanish olive sector is characterized by uncertainty related to olive price as well as discount rate. Moreover, the timing of optimal investment decision is impacted positively by the high score of olive Spanish farms technical efficiency, as well as its low persistence over time. 
The CAP reform policy implemented after 2006, modified in 2007 and adjusted by the “Health Check” in 2009 can have a possible positive impact on olive grove investment. Under this policy, the olive sector receives direct payment decoupled by 100% from the production which is combined with the price support. The objective behind this market support is the stabilization of the market prices which can help to stabilize farm income and diminish the uncertainty related to price. This policy can allow the farm operator to have a more secure environment for future investment, which is guaranteed by the high technical efficiency scores of Spanish olive farms associated to low persistent inefficiency.

Appendix:


In order to carry out the Bayesian analysis, we need to specify a prior distribution  for location parameters,  and  (we assumed that those parameters are independent of the scale parameters  and ). The joint prior distribution is given by:


			(A.1)



where refers to the density of the k-variate normal distribution with mean vector m and covariance V. The parameter  has a prior distribution with the following density , while scale parameters ( and ) are independent with inverted-gamma prior:


		(A.2)

where  refers to any of , , and  are parameters of the prior distribution that need to be assigned (in these priors and the distributions are proper when). Using the standard data augmentation practice, we consider the joint posterior involving  and u (Tsionas, 2006), 


which is equivalent to 

 			(A.3)


The first term is the conditional distribution of observed y giving all parameters of the model (including and u). The second term is the join prior of all parameters. The Gibbs sampling method with data augmentation is used to take Monte Carlo draws from the joint posterior distribution of the model and to perform the computations (Gelfand and Smith, 1990). Using the conditional distribution of provided by the MCMC scheme, the technical efficiency is measured for each farm (Van den Broeck et al., 1994, Koop and Steel, 2001).
