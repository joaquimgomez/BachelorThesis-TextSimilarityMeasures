Abstract 

The growing importance of economic factors in farmers’ decision to go organic 

has raised interest in characterizing the economic behavior of organic versus 

conventional farms. In general, published analyses so far have not considered differential 

uncertainties, abilities to control production risk and farmers’ risk preferences between 

conventional and organic practices when comparing these techniques. Our article 

attempts to assess this issue. We use a model of farmer decision under risk to analyze the 

differential values between organic and conventional Spanish arable crop farms and to 

assess the incentives for adoption of organic practices. Results show that organic and 

conventional farms do have different production risks as well as different aversions to 

risk. Organic price premiums and subsidies are found to be powerful instruments to 

motivate adoption of organic techniques.

1. Introduction 

 

The environmental community is striving to motivate the adoption of technologies 

that will lead to sustainable development. According to Our Common Future (The 

Brundtland report, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987), 

sustainable development consists of three components—economic, natural, and social 

sustainability.  Organic farming is one ingredient of sustainable development policy, and 

one of its presumed merits is that it is more favorable and accommodating to small 

farmers than chemical-intensive farming systems. However, by reducing the use of 

chemical inputs, organic farmers may expose themselves to more risk than conventional 

farmers. This may result in larger farmers who are less risk-averse to be more likely to 

adopt organic methods, thus reducing the value of organic farming as an instrument for 

preserving small family farms. In this paper we utilize a case study to compare 

uncertainties, abilities to control production uncertainties, and risk preferences associated 

with organic and nonorganic arable crop-growing farmers in Spain. 

 While the initial evolution of the organic sector was mainly supply driven, 

consumers have more recently become the most relevant driving force. Since the 1990s, 

organic produce sales have soared in developed countries as consumer confidence in agri-

industrial foods has eroded from a series of food scares (Bovine Spongiform 

Encephalopathy, Escherichia Coli, the H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza), 

proliferating pharmaceuticals, genetically modified organisms in food production, as well 

as consumer concerns about environmental issues (Thompson, 1998; Dimitri and 

Oberholtzer, 2006; Stevens-Garmon et al., 2007). Food safety problems also generated a 



 2

profound crisis in large sections of the conventional farming industry.  As noted by Rigby 

et al. (2001), this created a situation characterized by both a dramatic increase in the 

demand for organic produce and, at the same time, a significant number of farmers 

looking for alternatives to stay in business. This represented a strong incentive to shift to 

organic farming. The growing social interest in organic farming has led many countries, 

especially EU counties, to provide financial help to assist in conversion. In 2003, the 

European Union (EU) accounted for half of worldwide organic food retail sales. The 

United States accounted for almost the other half of the global market (Dimitri and 

Oberholtzer, 2006).  

 The reasons that motivate farmers to convert to organic methods have been 

thoroughly studied in the literature. While early adopters seem to have been mainly 

driven by noneconomic motivations, such as different personal attitudes and lifestyle, the 

determinants of adoption have fundamentally changed over time, with economic factors 

gaining more relevance (Lohr and Salomonsson, 2000). Understanding the economic 

behavior of both organic and conventional farmers is thus important to better characterize 

these two groups and to improve the understanding that we have on adoption decisions. A 

literature review (see next section) suggests that published analyses so far have not 

considered differential uncertainties and farmers’ risk preferences between conventional 

and organic practices. Two notable exceptions are the papers by Gardebroek (2006) and 

Lien et al. (2004). The switch from conventional to organic farming is likely to entail a 

change in output variability caused by a change in management techniques and input use. 

Also, to the extent that profit mean and variance differ among organic and conventional 

farms, farmers’ risk preferences may be key to understanding economic behavior.  



 3

Our article attempts to assess this issue. Specifically, we aim to characterize 

organic and conventional farms’ production technologies under risk, by using flexible 

production function specifications that allow the impacts of inputs on the output mean to 

differ from their effects on the stochastic element of production. To do so, we use data 

from a sample of Spanish farms specialized in the production of arable crops. We also 

assess organic and conventional farmers’ risk preferences. Given the differences between 

organic and conventional farms and farmers, we expect to find different attitudes towards 

risk. Finally, we assess farmers’ decision to adopt organic farming by conducting a 

simulation exercise that compares the expected utility under each alternative (organic and 

conventional) and different economic scenarios. Results are compared to adoption 

patterns that would result from a risk-neutral scenario.  

Our article is organized as follows. The next section reviews previous literature on 

the differences between organic and conventional farms as well as on the motivations to 

adopt organic farming techniques. We then present the theoretical framework. The 

Spanish organic agriculture is described thereafter. Details of the data and model 

estimation techniques are presented in the empirical application section. A discussion of 

the results follows. We devote the last section of our article to the concluding remarks. 

 

2. Organic Versus Conventional Farms: A Literature Review 

 

The increasing interest in organic farming techniques especially since the 1990s 

has produced a number of scholarly articles that assess the differences between organic 

and conventional farms, as well as the decision to adopt. A number of these studies are 



 4

based on a qualitative assessment of survey farm-level data (Freyer et al., 1994; Lampkin, 

1994; Fairweather and Campbell, 1996; Fairweather, 1999). There have also been a 

number of statistical approaches to address the issue of adoption of new technologies that 

can be classified into three main groups (Rigby et al., 2001): bivariate analyses 

measuring adoption at a certain point in time (Burton et al., 1999; Lohr and Salomonsson, 

2000), diffusion analyses that address the aggregate cumulative adoption rate of a new 

technology (Feder et al., 1985), and duration analyses that explain how long it takes a 

farmer to adopt a particular technology (Burton et al., 1999). 

 Published research has identified several relevant characteristics that influence 

adoption. These characteristics include both noneconomic and economic factors. Among 

the noneconomic factors, it is worth mentioning farmers’ personal characteristics and 

attitudes, lifestyle choices, concerns about health and the environment, access to technical 

and financial information on organic farming, geographical issues, and farm structural 

characteristics. Economic factors such as the availability of sales outlets, public subsidies, 

transition costs, or organic produce price premiums are also crucial to understand 

adoption processes. As noted, these economic factors have gained relevance over time.  

In light of the changes in the motivation to go organic, some more recent analyses 

have focused their attention exclusively on the economic determinants of adoption (Gay 

and Offermann, 2006; Pietola and Oude Lansink, 2001). Of interest is also the paper by 

Oude Lansink and Jensma (2003), which compares the economic performance of Dutch 

organic versus conventional farms using a risk-neutral profit maximization approach.  

In spite of the shift in interest towards differentiating organic and conventional 

farms based on economic variables, most previous studies have not considered 



 5

differential risk preferences and uncertainties between the two groups. Gardebroek 

(2006) makes an exception to this rule by comparing risk attitudes of organic and 

conventional farms using the Antle (1989) nonstructural approach. A Bayesian random 

coefficient model is used to derive individual Arrow-Pratt coefficients for a sample of 

arable farmers in the Netherlands. Organic farmers are found to be less risk averse than 

their nonorganic colleagues. Using a completely different approach, Lien et al. (2004) 

carry out a survey to cash crop Norwegian farmers to evaluate their risk perceptions. 

They find organic farmers to perceive themselves to be less risk averse than their 

conventional counterparts. 

We aim at characterizing the economic performance of organic versus 

conventional farms by allowing for different risk, abilities to control risk, and attitudes 

towards this risk. To do so, we use a structural approach that allows for both price and 

output risk and for risk preferences. The structural approach offers some advantages over 

using a nonstructural model. Specifically, this methodology allows for optimal decision 

rules to be derived for the different inputs, and provides information on the contribution 

of each input on the moments of the random payoff. As a result, farmers’ ability to 

control production risk through input use can be assessed. It also permits us to distinguish 

between different sources of risk and appreciates the different impacts that each one has 

on farmers’ decisions. Finally, our approach allows for simulations on the impacts of 

different economic scenarios on the decisions made by farmers. This is particularly 

relevant in analyses trying to assess the adoption of a new technology.  

The literature has provided evidence that risk considerations affect agricultural 

input use and technology adoption both in developing countries (Just and Zilberman, 



 6

1983; Feder et al., 1985; Byerlee and Hesse de Polanco, 1986; Kebede, 1992) and in 

developed countries (Brink and McCarl, 1978; Marra and Carlson, 1990; Just and Pope, 

2002). Just and Pope (1978) establish that production technologies can affect both the 

mean and variability of yields, and thus profits, and distinguish between inputs that are 

risk reducing and risk increasing. Let’s assume, for example, that synthetic pesticides 

contribute to reducing output variability by raising agricultural production in unfavorable 

states of nature (Horowitz and Lichtenberg, 1994). Because organic practices involve a 

reduction in the use of synthetic inputs such as pesticides, the shift from conventional to 

organic methods could alter production risk. Our analysis will allow for such differences.  

There is also plenty of evidence that farmers are not likely to be neutral to risk and 

tend to be risk averse (Antle, 1989; Chavas and Holt, 1990; Bar-Shira et al., 1997; Saha, 

1997; Hennessy, 1998; Just and Pope, 2002; Isik and Khanna, 2003; Serra et al., 2006). 

The role of risk and risk aversion in the adoption and evaluation of innovations varies 

across technologies and has not been sufficiently investigated for some recent farming 

methods (Marra et al., 2003). Because of the supposed impacts of organic farming 

practices, an analysis of these methods should investigate their yield risk effects, and 

attempt to understand adoption by evaluating differences in risk preferences.

3. The Model 

 

The aim of our research is to allow for uncertainty and risk preferences in 

assessing the value of organic practices relative to conventional ones. To do so, we will 

consider a farm with a fixed amount of land  A . The farmer can either produce under 

conventional or organic methods represented by superscripts  C  and  O , respectively. 

Farms’ per hectare production function with an explicit heteroskedastic error structure is 

represented by 
   y

I = f (x I ,z I ,αααα I ) + g(x I ,z I ,ββββ I )ε  (Just and Pope, 1978), where 

  I = C,O ,  y
I  represents agricultural output,   x

I  is a vector of   j = 1,..., J  variable inputs, 

  z
I  is a vector of   q = 1,..,Q  quasi-fixed inputs,  αααα

I  and  ββββ
I  are parameter vectors, and ε  is 

an iid error term with zero mean and unit variance.  

Output mean and variance functions can be expressed as 
   
E y I


= f (x

I ,z I ,αααα I )  

and 
   
Var y I


= g(x

I ,z I ,ββββ I ) , respectively. Following Just and Pope (1978), an input

j
I  is 

said to be risk-increasing (neutral) [decreasing] if 

  

∂Var y I


> (=)[<]0 . Since organic 

farming involves a change in both the quantity and the quality of inputs, it is likely that 

 αααα
C ≠ ααααO  and  ββββ

C ≠ ββββO . This is very likely to cause differences in the value that farmers 

attribute to each technology, which we measure using a utility function.  

It is assumed that producers make decisions to maximize their expected utility of 

wealth:

over the mean and standard deviation of wealth, i.e., max [ ( )] max [ , ]I

To operationalize this theoretical framework, it is assumed that farmers’ 

preferences can be represented by Saha’s (1997) flexible utility function which does not 

restrict the specific type of risk preferences. By omitting the superscript I, the utility can 

be expressed as 
 
u = W θ −σ

1 Our analysis compares conventional versus organic farms once the latter have undergone the official 

conversion period. Data on adoption costs, which include lack of access to full price premiums during the 

conversion process, information and experience gathering, etc. (Lampkin et al., 2002), are unavailable. As a 

result, our analysis assumes that adoption costs have been supported and covered exclusively during the 

transition period which we do not consider.

Empirical testing will be used in this application to choose the functional forms 

characterizing the output mean ( ( , , )f x z αααα ) and variance ( ( , , )g βx z ). A conventional 

farmer will consider going organic if  V
O > V C , i.e., if the expected utility obtained from 

organic practices is greater than under conventional practices. Hence, both differential 

expected profit and profit variability will be important distinctions in comparing the value 

of the two alternatives. In this regard, and contrary to a risk-neutral scenario, organic 

produce price premiums will have two opposing impacts on the value of organic 

practices. On the one hand, higher prices will increase utility by increasing expected

. Also, under our framework, differential abilities to control output 

risk through input use may be important to understand producer decisions. Production 

technologies generating higher expected yields with lower variability will be preferred by 

risk-averse farmers.

evidence in favor of risk aversion (Bar-Shira et al., 1997; Saha, 1997; Gardebroek, 2006).

This expression shows that the impact of price and output uncertainty on input use arises 

from the existence of a marginal risk premium (MP) that is equivalent to the distance 

between the variable input expected marginal income and its unit cost.  

Our theoretical model provides a tool to compare the performance of organic 

versus conventional farms, but does not allow anticipating the differences between the 

two groups. Empirical investigation will be needed to test whether there are differences 

between organic and conventional production technologies and to determine whether 

organic and conventional growers have different risk attitudes.

4. Spain as a Producer of Organic Arable Crops 

 

Interest in organic agriculture in the EU has caused a relevant increase in the 

organic area since the 1990s (from 0.7 million hectares in 1993 to 5.1 million in 2003).3 

The EU accounts for a large proportion of the worldwide organic production area. In 

2003, the European continent represented 23.2% of the world organic land (21.8% if we 

focus only on the EU), ranking third behind Oceania (43.2%) and Latin America 

(23.7%). Europe was followed by North America (5.7%), Asia (2.7%), and Africa 

(1.5%).  

Spain occupies a prominent position in the EU-15 ranking of organically grown 

area and is the focus of this study. Together with Germany, it is the EU-15’s second 

largest producer (with about 0.7 million hectares in 2003) after Italy (who devotes around 

1 million hectares to organic farming). As is the case with Europe, the Spanish organic 

area has also experienced a spectacular growth during the last decades, from 11.7 

thousand hectares in 1993 to 725.2 thousand by 2003. The latter figure represents almost 

3% of the Spanish utilized agricultural area (UAA), a figure still below the EU-15 

average (4% in 2003). The expansion in organic areas has somewhat slowed down during 

the 2000 decade relative to the growth registered throughout the 1990s.  

The number of organic holdings has also experienced an important increase both 

in the EU and in Spain. While in 1993 Spain had 753 organic holdings, the figure 

                                                 
3 Data presented in this section are obtained from the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture (2005) and the 

Commission of the European Communities (2005). 



 12

increased to 17,028 in 2003, the latter representing about 12% of EU’s organic producers. 

The number of Spanish organic agricultural holdings reached a maximum in 2003, then 

experienced a slight decline. As is the case with the EU, the average size of Spanish 

organic holdings (slightly above 40 hectares) is considerably larger than the conventional 

farms’ average UAA (which was a little above 20 hectares in 2003).  

 Of the 2003 EU-15 organic area, 61% was devoted to grassland and fodder crops, 

25% to arable crops, while horticulture and other crops represented 8% and 6%, 

respectively. Hence, almost 65% of the organic crop area was planted with arable crops, 

with cereals representing the most important commodity and occupying 70% of the 

organic arable area. Spain was third in the EU-15 ranking of organic arable crop 

production after Germany and Italy. With 0.16 million hectares, it concentrated about 

12% of the EU-15’s organic arable crop surface. As is the case with Europe, arable crops 

represent the most relevant organic crop in Spain (half of the Spanish organic crop area). 

Olive groves and dried fruits follow arable crops in the distribution of the organic area by 

crop type. Given the relevance of Spain in the EU production of organic arable crops, as 

well as the importance of these crops both within the EU and Spanish organic area, our 

analysis focuses on a sample of Spanish farms specialized in the production of cereals, 

oilseeds, and protein (COP) crops.   

 

5. Empirical Application: data and estimation techniques 

 

Farm-level data are taken from the European Commission’s Farm Accounting Data 

Network (FADN) for the period 2001 to 2003. The sample is an incomplete panel of data 



 13

composed of 3,626 observations that produce under conventional systems and 68 

observations that operate using organic practices. Since input prices are unavailable from 

FADN, we use country-level input price indices. These indices are taken from Eurostat’s 

New Cronos Database.  

In order to keep the vector of parameters to estimate to a manageable size, we 

allow for two aggregate variable inputs (
  
x

1
 and 2x ) and a quasi-fixed input ( 1z ). Table 1 

contains summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis. Variable input   x1  is a 

composite input that includes seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection products. Other crop-

specific direct inputs such as water or energy are comprised in   x2 . Variable   z1  

represents labor that is considered as a quasi-fixed input and measured in hours per 

hectare.  

To define 
  x1

 and 
  x2

, individual input quantity and price indices are aggregated 

into composite quantity and price indices by using an expenditure-weighted geometric 

mean. Specifically, for each input quantity and price aggregate we follow the next four 

steps. First, the expenditure on each individual input that will integrate the aggregate is 

deflated using the annual producer price index.4 Second, this expenditure is divided by 

total input expenditure to determine expenditure shares. Third, a geometric price index is 

calculated as the product (across all inputs) of each price index raised to the power of its 

corresponding expenditure share. Finally, input quantity indices are derived by dividing 

total expenditure by this price index.  

 

                                                 
4 FADN database only registers input expenditure. The quantity of input applied is not available. 



 14

Output  y  aggregates the production of COP crops.
5 The price for each 

component of the aggregate output is approximated at the farm-level through the ratio of 

farm-level sales expressed in constant currency units to production (in tons per hectare). 

As is the case with input aggregates, output quantity and price aggregates are also built 

by using weighted averages. Initial wealth is defined as a farm’s net worth, while 

government subsidies include Common Agricultural Policy subsidies to arable crops (
  
S

1
) 

and environmental subsidies (
  
S

2
). As is well known, EU agri-environmental subsidies 

provide for payments to farmers in return for assuming agri-environmental commitments. 

Farmers are paid for the cost of implementing these commitments as well as for any 

losses in income they might entail. In Spain, however, these measures are relatively 

unimportant compared to other EU countries (Commission of the European 

Communities, 2005).   

To specify the output mean and variance, different functional forms are 

considered.6 Using Pollak and Wales (1991) likelihood dominance criterion for testing 

non-nested hypotheses we settle with a quadratic7 form for the mean output and a Cobb-

Douglas for the output variance. The final model to be estimated is: 

 

                                                 
5 Davis et al. (2000) extend the generalized composite commodity theorem and provide support for 

consistent aggregation of agricultural production in the United States into as few as two categories: crops 

and livestock. 

6 Both the quadratic and cobb-douglas specification were tried for the output mean. Exponential and 

cobb-douglas specifications were considered for the output variance.  

7 Quadratic functional forms allow flexibility of elasticities throughout the range of feasible input levels 

and yield superior results relative to more restrictive forms (Isik and Khanna, 2003).

The parameters that are multiplied by the organic farming dummy variable 

capture differences in technology and risk preferences between organic and conventional 

farms, and allow for a direct test of whether these differences are statistically significant 

or not. Since our sample farms are located in different Spanish Autonomous 

Communities, regional dummy variables are added as shifters of function ( , , )x zf αααα  to 

account for unobserved regional differences in climate, land quality and quantity, farm 

management skills, or agricultural production techniques.  



 16

Technology and risk preference parameters have been jointly estimated in a few 

studies. However, most of these analyses either impose restrictive assumptions on the 

utility and production functions, or they only allow for a single source of risk (Love and 

Buccola, 1991; Saha et al., 1994). The use of flexible technology and utility functions 

that consider both price and output risk complicate the model and its estimation (Love 

and Buccola, 1991). To overcome this limitation a two stage estimation approach can be 

used.  

Our model is estimated using the two-step procedure proposed by Kumbhakar 

(2002). In the first stage, production function parameter estimates (equation 3a) are 

derived by maximum likelihood procedures as proposed by Just and Pope (1978). The 

second step involves estimation of the system of first order conditions (equations 3b and 

3c) conditional on the estimators from the first step by NL3SLS, thus recognizing the 

potential for correlated errors across the set of first-order conditions.8  

The two step estimation procedure used here may involve efficiency problems 

(Isik and Khanna, 2003; Serra et al., 2006). To overcome these problems, we use Monte 

Carlo bootstrapping procedures. More specifically, we generate 1,000 pseudo-samples of 

the same size as the actual sample, drawn with replacement. Parameters are estimated for 

each pseudo-sample of data. Covariance matrices for the parameter estimates are derived 

from the distribution of the replicated estimates generated in the bootstrap. Our non-

                                                 
8 Though we tried to estimate equations 3a, 3b and 3c jointly by NL3SLS, the optimization process failed 

to converge. Model estimation was carried out by using SAS software version 9.1. 

 



 17

parametric bootstrapping approach produces estimates that are robust to various 

misspecification errors, including heteroskedasticity.  

 

6. Results  

 

Table 1 shows that organic farms have per hectare yields that are above 

conventional yields. Table 1 also shows that in order to achieve these yields, organic 

farms incur higher input costs per hectare.9 Differences in input use probably suggest 

differences in the productive orientation between the two groups. An important segment 

of Spanish conventional arable crop farms consists of extensive dryland holdings with 

low added value and low input use. Conversely, our organic sample farms have higher 

gross margins per hectare and use land more intensively. An example is the use of water. 

While conventional farms irrigate, on average, a 10% of their UAA, organic holdings 

irrigate about 20% of their productive area. It is also likely that organic farms are placed 

on better soils than their conventional counterparts. 

Organic farms receive a price premium for their produce of almost 30% relative 

to conventional holdings. From Table 1, it can also be inferred that organic farms have 

per hectare gross margins that are about a 25% higher than conventional profits. 

Subsidies among the two groups also differ, with organic farms receiving higher COP 

compensatory payments per hectare, which is the result of these farms producing 

                                                 
9 A word of caution should however be offered here since a direct comparison between organic and 

conventional input costs cannot be made, as

 not only differ in quantity but also in quality. 



 18

relatively more high-subsidy crops such as oilseeds and protein crops. As expected, 

environmental subsidies per hectare are also higher for organic farms.  

 Parameter estimates representing average production (Table 2) are not statistically 

different between the two groups. At the data means, both organic and conventional 

technologies are characterized by (short-run) decreasing returns to scale. In both cases the 

output mean elasticity of 1x  is substantially higher than the output mean elasticity of 2x  

(around 0.5 and 0.06 respectively for both organic and conventional farms), which shows 

the relevance of seeds, fertilizers and crop protection products for output growth. 

 Most conventional sample farms are located in five Spanish Autonomous 

Communities: Castilla-León, Extremadura, Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha and Aragón. 

Organic farms are mainly located in Andalucía and Aragón. Parameter estimates 

representing regional dummy variables show that there are statistically significant 

differences in output mean between the main producing regions. Farms in Aragón, 

Castilla-La Mancha and Extremadura are found to have higher yields relative to 

Andalucía, which is used as the benchmark region, while yields in Castilla-León are 

found to be smaller relative to the reference region.  

Since parameters ,  1, 2,3oi iβ =  are not statistically significant, estimates for the 

stochastic component of production show that, with the exception of other inputs such as 

water, input use by both conventional and organic farms is essentially risk increasing. 

Hence, an increase in the use of seeds, fertilizers, crop-protection products and labor 

contributes to increased production in already good states of nature. Other direct inputs 

such as water are found to reduce risk. This latter result is not surprising since the use of 

irrigation technologies is expected to reduce output variability. The fact that parameters 



 19

,  1, 2,3oi iβ =  are not statistically different from zero also involves that the output 

variance elasticity of inputs is not statistically different between organic and conventional 

practices. However, since our organic farms have substantially higher levels of input use 

and in spite of a negative and statistically significant correction of 0β  through 0
oβ , output 

variability is higher for organic farms. This is corroborated below.  

Table 3 presents mean predicted values for the output mean and standard 

deviation, as well as the coefficient of variation of output. As can be seen, the coefficient 

of variation for organic farms is higher (0.65 versus 0.54). If organic farms are faced with 

higher output variability, one should expect organic farmers to be less risk averse than 

their conventional counterparts, for given output levels.  

Results show that there are no statistically significant differences between organic 

and conventional farmers’ risk preference parameters. Both groups are risk averse  γ > 0  

(Table 2) and since  θ > 1 , they all exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA). Our 

risk preference results are compatible with previous research (Saha et al., 1994; Bar-Shira 

et al., 1997; Isik and Khanna, 2003). Because DARA preferences involve a degree of risk 

aversion that decreases with wealth and since our organic farms are wealthier than their 

conventional counterparts, organic farms are more willing to assume more risk. These 

findings are consistent with the results derived by Gardebroek (2006) and by Lien et al. 

(2004) and suggest that some people may not adopt organic farming techniques unless 

some risk-reducing mechanisms are available in the market (Chavas, 1994).  

Thus, for our sample of farms, organic farming seems to be an alternative mainly 

benefiting wealthier farmers rather than small poor ones. This is compatible with recent 

trends in the organic sector both in the EU and in the United States, characterized by a 



 20

decline in the number of small and medium-sized family-operated organic farms that 

have been progressively replaced by big farms as corporations, attracted by the economic 

potential of the organic market niche, have entered the business (see, for example, Just 

and Zilberman, 1983; Guthman, 2004).   

 In order to assess farmers’ decision to adopt organic farming, we compare, in a 

simulation exercise, the expected utility under organic and conventional farming under 

different economic scenarios. Specifically, we compute the number of conventional farms 

that would be willing to go organic at different levels of organic produce price premiums 

and environmental subsidies. To do so, we select year 200110 and numerically solve the 

system of first-order conditions for conventional farms and compute optimal utility 

levels. We then compute the optimal under the assumption that the same group of farms 

operates with the organic technology and compare utility levels under different economic 

scenarios to determine the rate of adoption ( V
O > V C ).  

It is important to note that ours is a very simplified exercise that compares utility 

levels before and after adoption, but that does not consider the costs of adoption that are 

unobserved. Also, our analysis ignores, as a result of a lack of information, possible 

constraints affecting adoption such as a shortage of organic inputs. In that ours is a static 

result, it does not allow for erosion in price premiums as organic adoption and the supply 

of organic products increases. By ignoring the drop in price premiums, our simulations 

tend to overestimate adoption. In this regard, our estimates should be interpreted very 

carefully and should not be extrapolated beyond a simple comparison of utility levels 

derived from organic and conventional techniques in a static framework.  

                                                 
10 In 2001 there were 1,321 conventional farms in our sample. 



 21

In a scenario where there are no adoption costs, a price premium of 40% is found 

to lead adoption of about 37% of the farms, while a 90% premium may trigger the 

adoption of almost 70% of conventional farms (table 4). We first define the quickest 

adopters as farms that convert under unfavorable economic conditions (low price 

premiums). Our results show that these correspond to wealthy farms that enter the 

organic sector producing a relatively modest amount of output. Output levels and output 

variance will increase as premiums become more substantial. Poorer farms tend to adopt 

later on when economic conditions are more favorable, which results in a negative 

relationship between premiums and adopters’ wealth (fourth column in table 4). 

For comparison purposes, we also study differential values of organic and 

conventional practices under the assumption of certainty and risk neutrality. We expect 

risk-neutral producers to adopt at a quicker path relative to risk-averse agents. As noted, 

an increase in output price will increase both the wealth mean and variance. While risk-

neutral farmers only consider the improvement in the expected wealth (profit), risk-

averse agents will take into account both the increase in mean and variance. This will 

cause the latter group to adopt more cautiously. As expected, Table 4 shows that adoption 

is quicker under the risk-neutrality hypothesis. For example, while a price premium on 

the order of 40% motivates the adoption of 37% of the farmers under a risk-averse 

scenario, it yields cumulative adoption rates on the order of 48% in a risk-neutral 

environment. Differences between the two scenarios are reduced for high price 

premiums.  

The same exercise is repeated for different levels of environmental subsidies 

(actual subsidy levels received by sample farms are compared with other alternative 



 22

amounts). As noted previously, agri-environmental subsidies are very low in Spain 

compared to the EU-15 aid levels. According to the Commission of the European 

Communities (2005), EU-15’s average premium for organic or in-conversion land is 

around 180 € per hectare, while the average agri-environmental premium is on the order 

of 90 €. We analyze adoption for these as well as for other subsidy levels around EU-15 

averages. In Table 4 one can see that a 90 € subsidy could trigger the conversion of about 

14% of the farms, while a payment of 180 € may induce the conversion of 21% of the 

farms. The same pattern of adoption observed for an increase in price premiums is also 

observed here. First adopters are the wealthier farms and an increase in subsidies 

motivates the adoption of progressively poorer farms. 

We now compare differential values of organic and conventional practices under 

a risk-averse and a risk-neutral scenario with different levels of subsidies. An 

environmental subsidy will increase the expected profit without altering its variance. As a 

result, differences between the two scenarios should be smaller relative to the price 

sensitivity analysis. Table 4 shows that risk neutral adoption rates are higher but, as 

expected, differences between the two scenarios have been reduced relative to the price 

analysis. For example, both a 20% price premium and a subsidy of 90 euros per hectare 

motivate the adoption of 14% of the farms in the sample. If these farms were risk neutral, 

33% would adopt as a result of the price premium, in contrast to a 22% as a result of the 

subsidy. 

Our results, which can only be applied to our sample of Spanish farms, are in 

accord with findings from Isik and Khanna (2003), who suggest that uncertainties and 

risk aversion preferences are possible causes to explain the low observed adoption rates 



 23

of precision farming technologies. They are also compatible with the results derived by 

Marra and Carlson (1990) and Brink and McCarl (1978) who show that risk aversion 

reduces the adoption of double-cropping systems. 

 

7. Concluding Remarks 

 

The literature comparing organic and nonorganic farming has identified several factors 

that affect the decision to go organic. However, the role of differences in risk and risk 

attitudes has not been sufficiently investigated. Given the potential control over 

production variability that can be exercised with the use of inputs and given the 

differences in input use between conventional and organic farms, one should explicitly 

allow for risk differentials between the two practices. Additionally, these differentials 

may also be associated with different attitudes toward risk. We use a model of farmer 

decision-making under risk to analyze the differential values between Spanish arable crop 

organic and conventional farms and to assess the incentives for adoption of organic 

practices.  

 Results show that organic farms have higher output coefficients of variation than 

their conventional counterparts. As for risk preferences and consistently with Gardebroek 

(2006), both groups are found to display DARA preferences. Because DARA preferences 

involve a degree of risk aversion that decreases with wealth and since our organic sample 

farms are wealthier than their conventional counterparts, organic farms are more willing 

to assume more risk. Thus, for our sample of farms, organic farming seems to be an 

alternative mainly benefiting wealthier farmers rather than small poor ones.   



 24

The fact that organic farming is mainly benefiting wealthier farms is important 

and in accord with the recent evolution of the sector characterized by a progressive 

industrialization (Guthman, 2004). Hence, an important part of the EU public subsidies to 

motivate adoption may benefit wealthy farmers. However, to the extent that these 

subsidies aim at compensating farmers for environmental externalities, income 

distribution issues should be less relevant. 

We then simulate conventional farms’ adoption paths at different levels of organic 

produce price premiums and environmental subsidies in a static scenario where adoption 

costs and restrictions are assumed to be zero. Prices are found to be a powerful 

instrument to motivate adoption, with price premiums on the order of 50% triggering the 

adoption of about 46% of the sample. Environmental subsidies at current levels are not a 

significant economic motivation. However, if Spanish farms were to receive EU-average 

subsidy levels, this could motivate the adoption of a substantial number of farms. Of 

interest is the finding that early adopters correspond to wealthy farmers. However, as 

economic conditions for conversion improve, progressively poorer farms shift to organic. 

Obviously, our study should be interpreted with care since we do not observe 

adoption costs. Observation and consideration of these costs is very likely to yield much 

more conservative estimates than the ones derived. More conservative estimates would 

also be obtained if price premiums were allowed to erode as conversion rates increase.  

Our simulation results also show that a scenario that allows for uncertainties and 

risk preferences yields slower adoption rates than the ones related to a risk-neutral 

scenario. These results suggest that insurance schemes may be a useful mechanism to 

induce the adoption of organic farming, given the higher risk it entails and the lower risk 



 25

aversion of early adopters. This idea is consistent with Carlson (1979) and Smith and 

Goodwin (1996) who claim that crop insurance is likely to reduce pesticide use (a claim 

debated by Horowitz and Lichtenberg, 1993). Suggesting that insurance schemes 

protecting organic growers will induce adoption of organic systems does not imply that 

these schemes are necessarily efficient. Thus, studies on such schemes and their 

implications are subjects for future research.
