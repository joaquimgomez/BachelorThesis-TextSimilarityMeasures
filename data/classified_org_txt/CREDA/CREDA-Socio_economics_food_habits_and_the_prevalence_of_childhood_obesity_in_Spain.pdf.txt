Abstract
Background: In 2012, the prevalence of obesity and overweight statuses among children in Spain was 9% and 26%, respectively. Concerns about childhood obesity have increased over the past few years, as obesity developed during childhood can persist throughout an individual’s lifetime (cohort effect). This study aims to develop a better understanding of the factors influencing the prevalence of obesity in Spain.
Methods: Microdata from the last available National Health Survey (2012) are used, and the methodological framework is based on the estimation of a sample selection model.  
Results: Results suggest that the prevalence of obesity increases among children who live in households of a lower socio-economic status and households in which parents are obese. Lower levels of childhood physical activity are positively related to the probability of being obese. Finally, there exists a positive relationship between children’s body mass index (BMI) and an inappropriate intake of fresh fruits, fish, pasta and rice, legumes, sweets and soft drinks.
Conclusions: The methodological framework used in this study is flexible enough to be used in traditional longitudinal studies. Children’s and households’ lifestyles play a pivotal role in the prevalence of obesity. Policies should be oriented toward changing lifestyles, which would require more multidisciplinary research in the future to reduce childhood obesity.

1. Introduction
During the past few decades, farm policies, including farms’ commodity programs and public agricultural research and development, have played a pivotal role in the substantial transformation of food diets (Alston et al., 2008). As Gil et al. (1995) show, declining real food prices have generated not only an increase in total calorie intake but also a shift towards a diet with higher caloric density that is richer in cholesterol and saturated fats. Additionally, an increasingly sedentary lifestyle has caused calorie expenditure to decline. As a result of both trends, food diets in most developed countries are clearly unbalanced and have produced a rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight, obesity and related non-communicable diseases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 1.6 billion overweight adults worldwide and that at least 30% of them are obese (WHO, 2007). By 2015, these figures are expected to rise to 2.3 billion overweight and 700 million obese adults. The increasing obesity problem has now become a public health issue that deserves attention from public authorities to implement policies that impact food consumption, the quality of diet, physical activity and, consequently, body weight. To address such concerns in Spain, the Strategy for Nutrition, Physical Activity and Prevention of Obesity (NAOS) was launched in 2005, bringing obesity and overweight to the forefront of social concerns. In 2011, the Spanish Government launched the new Law of Food Safety and Nutrition under which the Observatory for Nutrition and Obesity Studies was created in 2013. Special attention has been paid to childhood obesity, as some food and lifestyle habits tend to persist throughout an individual’s lifetime (cohort effect). 
Childhood obesity and overweight can cause a significant reduction in quality of life (Tsiros et al., 2009) and increase the risk of teasing, bullying and social isolation (Lobstein et al., 2004). Thus, a better understanding of the factors affecting childhood obesity is needed to provide more accurate information to policy makers on how to orientate their policies. This is precisely the main objective of this paper. Although it is true that genetic factors may explain the magnitude of metabolic complications associated with obesity (Cardon et al, 1994), environmental factors such as dietary behaviors and lifestyles have largely been blamed as the major driving forces behind the epidemic outburst of obesity since the 1970s. 
Analyzing the environmental factors that affect the prevalence of obesity among children is not an easy task[footnoteRef:1]. The literature suggests that socio-demographics (Au and Yu, 2012; Oliver et al. 2012; Vicente-Rodríguez et al., 2008), children’s lifestyles (Rey-Lopez et al., 2008; Devís-Devís et al., 2012), parental socio-economic status (Loureiro and Nayga, 2005, Merten et al., 2009; Sanjay et al., 2000), economic factors (Cawley, 2006), and dietary habits and food consumption (Wolfe and Campbell, 1993) are some of the possible factors. Moreover, most of these factors are interrelated, making it difficult to isolate the effect of each individual factor. This can also explain the mixed results obtained by some studies on the impact of specific factors on childhood obesity. This study will focus on the environmental factors affecting childhood obesity while recognizing that children’s intrinsic characteristics are also important. [1:  See Papoutsi et al. (2013) for an extended literature review on this topic.] 

 From a methodological point of view, most of the literature refers to longitudinal studies conducted on representative samples at regional or national levels. While the data sets are exhaustive, the methodological framework used in these studies is relatively simple and based on simple correlations. Additionally, the role of economic factors is largely neglected. This study will use the most recent microdata from the 2012 Spanish Health Survey. Although we recognize that this dataset may be more limited than longitudinal studies, our main contribution to the current literature is centered on the methodological framework we have adopted. A multivariate approach has been used here to analyze the main factors affecting the prevalence of obesity in Spain, an approach that is based on the specification and estimation of a sample selection model. As we will discuss later, we have assumed that the Body Mass Index (BMI) (the variable used in the National Health Survey to measure the prevalence of obesity) is censored: it takes the value zero if the child has a BMI corresponding to normal weight and the corresponding BMI value otherwise. 

2. Methods
2.1. Data: The National Health Survey
Data from the 2012 Spanish National Health Survey (ENS) are used in this study. The ENS collects information from a sample of 21,508 Spanish households with 21,007 adults (15 years old and over) and 5,495 children (under 15 years old). The survey was divided into three questionnaires: 1) the household questionnaire, 2) the adult questionnaire, and 3) the children’s questionnaire. The household questionnaire collected information about all the members of the household, including some basic demographic variables and the socio-demographic characteristics of the person who contributed most to the household budget. The adult questionnaire collected information on one selected member of the household over 15 years old. If there were children in the home, a minor was randomly selected. Data from the minor were supplied by the mother or the father (or the guardian)[footnoteRef:2]. The latter will be the focus of this study, although some household characteristics will be taken from the other two questionnaires. For the purposes of this study, children between 5 and 14 years old have been considered, as there was very limited information for children under 5. The final sample consisted of 1,055 children. Table 1 shows their main socio-demographic characteristics and some data about the adult completing the questionnaire within the household.  [2:  Information was collected in three phases. First, a letter was sent that informed the head of the household that they had been selected for the purposes of the survey and asked for collaboration. The letter also included some information about confidentiality and the need to provide accurate information. Finally, the letter announced the visit of a trained professional. In the second phase, face-to-face interviews were carried out to collect information for the household questionnaire. In the third phase, answers from the adult and, if applicable, the children questionnaires were collected. MSSSI (2013a) provides details about how non-response and attrition have been handled. ] 

In the ENS, weight status of each child was assessed according to the definitions established by the International Obesity Task Force, taking into account both the weight and the height of the child[footnoteRef:3] to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). Among the population between 2 and 17 years old, the BMI figure has been corrected by age and gender to properly classify the children as overweight or obese (Cole et al., 2000).  [3:  These data were reported by their parents or guardians. Weight and height of the children was obtained by asking: “Can you tell me approximately how much your child weights in kilograms without shoes or clothing?” and “Can you tell me approximately how tall your child is in centimeters, without shoes?”, respectively (Valdés-Pizarro and Royo-Bordonada, 2011). We are aware of the limitations of using a kind of self-reported data but we trust the method that has been used by the Ministry of Health, Social Affairs and Equality.] 

Data from ENS indicate that in 2012, the prevalence of obesity among the adult population was 18%, while 35% were overweight. In our children’s sample, the prevalence of obesity was 9%, while 26% of the sample was overweight. Comparing results with the previous survey available (2006) reveals an increase in the prevalence of overweight among Spanish children. In fact, in 2006, the percentage of children with normal weight was 70% (65% in 2011-12) while the percentage of overweight children was 21%. The prevalence of obesity has not changed (9%).
Table 2 provides some characteristics of the different groups of children taking into account their BMI status. As can be observed, the prevalence of children’s overweight and obesity is positively related to being a boy, younger (between 5 to 11 years old), the number of sleeping hours, the lower practice of physical activity (PA) and not having breakfast at home. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children is also related to household characteristics. Table 2 clearly indicates that the prevalence of obesity is affected by the education level of the head of the household, the size of the household, whether the children live with one single parent or whether the household has green areas available in the neighborhood.  
In relation to social class[footnoteRef:4] and town size, the relationship is less significant. Consistent with the existing literature, in Spain, the prevalence of childhood obesity increases as social class decreases. Finally, the prevalence of childhood overweight is 34% in smaller towns, while this percentage decreases up to 23% in middle sized and 27.3% in larger towns. However, among the last two types to towns, the prevalence of obesity and overweight is higher in larger towns.  [4:  Three segments have been considered: 1) Upper Social Class: Directors and managers of establishments with 5 or more employees, professionals traditionally associated with university degrees, other professional technical support, athletes and artists; 2) Medium Social Class: Intermediate occupations and self-employed, Supervisors and skilled workers in technical occupations; and 3) Lower Social Class: Skilled workers in the primary sector, other semi-skilled and unskilled workers.] 


2.2. Statistical Analysis
The econometric framework used to analyze the main factors affecting the prevalence of childhood obesity and overweight in Spain is mainly determined by how the dependent variable is measured. If BMI is measured as a categorical variable (normal weight, overweight and obesity, as an example), a multinomial logit model is appropriate. However, this model provides information only on how the selected factors contribute to the changes between one category and another; it does not provide information about the changes in BMI values within each category. If BMI is measured as a continuous variable, a simple regression (under any functional form) can be specified. However, in this case, parameter estimates measure the marginal changes in BMI values along the whole sample, independently of whether the children are of a normal weight, overweight or obese (parameters are constant along the full sample). 
In this study, BMI has been measured as a censored variable: if children have a normal weight, their BMI is set to zero; otherwise, BMI is measured as a continuous variable. In this framework, the main contribution of this study is to estimate a Sample Selection Model (SSM) to analyze the main factors affecting childhood BMI. The SSM consists of two equations: 1) the participation equation, a probit model in which factors affecting the probability of children being overweight or obese are considered; and 2) the outcome equation (only for overweight and obese children), which allows us to analyze factors affecting children’s BMI in this specific segment. The set of explanatory variables can be different in the two equations. The two equations can be expressed as follows: 
1. The selection equation in which the dependent variable (d1,i) is a dichotomous variable that equals 1 if the child is overweight or obese (; and 0, otherwise. 



2. The outcome equation in which the dependent (y2,i) variable is the BMI for overweight or obese children (

where  represents the children’s BMI, which is observable if and only if . Taking this into account, the Sample Selection Model is given by:




where =, (j=1, 2) are vectors of independent variables in each of the two equations. ,(j=1, 2) are vectors of the estimates (parameters). The  are the errors terms, following a normal distribution, j=1, 2 with . The sample selection model is estimated by maximum likelihood (Amemiya, 1984).

2.3. Main determinants of childhood overweight and obesity in Spain
To analyze the main factors affecting childhood obesity in Spain, we have taken into account the literature review and the specific characteristics and information contained in the ENS database, which was reported by the children’s father or mother. Explanatory variables have been grouped into the following categories: 1) socio-demographic factors (age and gender), 2) socio-economic status of the parents (social class, parents’ education level, town size, marital status, parents’ BMI, household size), 3) childhood lifestyles (number of hours spent sleeping every day, time spent watching TV on weekdays and weekends, time spent playing videogames or with the computer on weekdays and on weekends, physical activity, availability of green spaces in the area), 4) dietary habits (food consumption and the type of breakfast the children consume), and 5) the Diet Quality Index. 
The last two categories need further consideration as the information provided by ENS is very limited. Parents are asked to complete a self-reported questionnaire related to the frequency of consumption of 12 food groups (fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meat, processed meat, fish, eggs, pasta and rice, legumes, snacks, soft drinks, sweets and fast food). Five frequency levels are defined: i) daily, ii) 3 or more times per week but not daily, iii) one or two times per week, iv) less than once per week, and v) no consumption. For each child, we have compared the frequency of consumption of each type of food category with the recommendations set in the Spanish Healthy Eating Guide (Guía de la Alimentación Saludable en España) developed since 1989 by the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC). If the frequency of consumption matches the recommendations, the child’s consumption of each food category is labelled as appropriate; it is labelled inappropriate otherwise. 
In relation to the construction of the Diet Quality Index, the following procedure has been followed, again using data from ENS and the recommendations from the SENC. In this case, the frequency of consumption of the different food categories has been classified into three categories: if the frequency of consumption matches the SENC’s recommendation, we assign 10 points to the child; if the frequency differs in one category, we assign 5 points (for instance, if the recommendation is 3-4 times per week and the individual consumes this specific product daily or one or two times per week); finally, if the recommended level differs in more than one category, we assign 0 points to this specific child. As we have 12 food categories, the maximum value for this new variable ranges between 0 and 120. Table 3 shows the full set of explanatory variables that have been considered in this study.

3. Results
Table 4 shows the estimated parameters for the two equations. One of the most important coefficients is ρ, which represents the correlation between the errors in the two equations. As can be observed, the value is 0.345, which is different from zero, suggesting that the Sample Selection Model is adequate for the purposes of this study. The first equation, the selection equation, is a probit equation and should be interpreted accordingly. The results from Table 4 indicate that among the socio-demographic factors, age and sex are the most relevant. In fact, being older and male increases the probability of being obese. In relation to the socio-economic status of the households, we have found that the probability of children being overweight or obese increases in larger and smaller towns in relation to middle-sized towns. Additionally, the probability of the prevalence of obesity is higher in lower social classes. Finally, our model indicates that in households where parents are obese, the probability of their children being overweight or obese also increases.
Results also indicate that there is a significant relationship between physical activity (PA) and the probability of being overweight or obese. In fact, lower PA is positively related to the probability of being obese. Sleeping hours and the amount of time spent watching TV are not significant factors in the probability of children being obese. Finally, the time spent playing videogames has two different effects depending on when children play them. During weekdays, there is a negative relationship between the time spent playing videogames and the probability of being overweight (the less time spent playing videogames, the higher is the child’s BMI). However, the effect is just the opposite if children play videogames during weekends.
We have not found any significant relationship between either the Diet Quality Index or the type of breakfast and the probability of children being overweight or obese. In relation to specific food products, results indicate a significant and positive effect of an inappropriate consumption of meat, eggs and fish on the probability of children being obese or overweight.
In relation to the second equation, results indicate that socio-demographic variables are relevant in the two equations. In overweight and obese children, BMI increases with age and in boys, which is also consistent with the existing literature referring to other countries reviewed in Section 2. In fact, BMI increases by 0.07 per year and, on average, the BMI for boys is 0.58 points higher than for girls.
One interesting result is that although the probability of being overweight or obese diminishes in middle-sized towns, once we consider only overweight and obese children, BMI values are higher there than in rural areas. The same trend has been found in larger towns among overweight and obese children. In relation to the social class, we mentioned that the probability of being obese in higher income households is higher than in other social classes; however, the average BMI among overweight and obese children is the same in all social classes. Considering parental marital status, our results indicate that living with both parents decreases the children’s average BMI by 0.41, consistent with the previous literature.
Past literature suggests that children’s lifestyles and food habits are key determinants of childhood obesity. The results in this study suggest that this is true when analyzing the probability of being overweight/obese (selection equation), but it is not relevant in the outcome equation. Households where parents are obese are more likely to have overweight and obese children (selection equation), but once we consider only those children who are overweight and obese, the relationship between children’s average BMI and parents’ BMI is negative in such households. The second relevant lifestyle variable is the time spent playing videogames. During weekdays, children who spend less time playing videogames (less than 1 hour/day) are more likely to be overweight or obese. Notably, for overweight and obese children, the relationship between time playing videogames and BMI is positive and significant. 
Finally, let us discuss results related to food consumption habits. Three important results should be outlined. First, whether children have breakfast does not have any impact on overweight and obese children’s BMI. Second, the Diet Quality Index is significant and negative; that is, among overweight and obese children, a better quality diet reduces their BMI. Third, estimated parameters indicate that an inappropriate intake of some food categories tends to increase children’s BMI. For instance, the BMI of obese and overweight children increases by 0.44 for an inappropriate intake of fresh fruits, 0.28 for fish, 0.41 for pasta and rice, 0.53 for legumes, 0.30 for sweets and 0.46 for soft drinks. 

4. Discussion
The age and sex of the child are variables commonly considered in childhood obesity studies because of the existing differences in the physiology of puberty, such as hormonal changes. In general, boys are more likely to be overweight or obese (Hume et al., 2009). Consistent with previous literature for Spain, among children’s socio-demographic characteristics, being older and male increase the probability of being obese (Moreno et al., 2005; Vicente-Rodríguez et al., 2008). The parents’ economic situation seems to be a key factor in explaining children’s weight status. Our results indicate that there exists a negative correlation between household income and obesity in children (as the household income decreases, the probability of being overweight/obese increases), as in Sanjay et al. (2000), Eagle et al. (2012) or, specifically for Spain, the AVENA study (Vicente-Rodríguez et al., 2008). Town size is also relevant with middle-sized towns showing a lower prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity in relation to larger and smaller towns. The literature has always supported the idea that childhood obesity is relatively more important in rural and smaller towns. In a previous study for Spain using the National Health Survey for 2006, Valdés-Pizarro and Royo-Bordonada (2011) showed that the prevalence of childhood obesity increased as the town size decreased. Our study suggests that from 2006 to 2012, childhood obesity has worsened in larger towns. Since the 2008 global economic crisis income inequality has increased mainly in larger towns (OECD statistics show that the average income of the top 10% as a multiple of the average income of the bottom 10% of the income scale grew from 10 to 12 between 2007 and 2011). Finally, we have found a significant and positive correlation between parental weight status and children obesity, as in Stewart et al. (2004).
A common result found in the literature is that childhood weight status is associated with the child’s sedentary or active lifestyle among which time spent watching TV, playing video games or with their mobile phones, their sleep duration and involvement in some physical activities are most relevant. In this study, lower childhood physical activity is positively related to the probability of being obese, as in Basterfield et al. (2012). Finally, the time spent playing videogames during weekends has a significant and positive association with the prevalence of obesity. The more time spent playing videogames, the higher the children’s BMI. In a previous study in Spain, Vicente-Rodríguez et al. (2008) estimated that each hour watching TV during weekends increases the risk of being overweight by 15.8% among adolescents and that each hour spent playing videogames increases this risk by 9.4%.
Children’s eating patterns (Oliveria et al., 1992), their food preferences (Borah-Giddens and Falciglia, 1993) and the quantity and frequency of consumption of some food items (Ochoa, 2007) are all important elements that can highly influence their weight status. However, in Spain, Moreno and Rodríguez (2007) concluded that there was not enough evidence to clarify the importance of children’s diet on their weight status. In our study, and again with all the limitations derived from how the variable has been measured, we have found that eating habits play a significant role in explaining childhood overweight and obesity. In fact, the Diet Quality Index is significantly negative (the lower the Diet Quality Index, the higher the BMI). Moreover, we have found a positive relationship between an inappropriate intake of some food products and children’s BMI. 
Although we have tried to fill a gap in the existing literature, further research is needed. First, the research that is currently being undertaken in medical research centers could incorporate the methodological approach we have proposed here to gain more insight into their data. Second, to tackle the obesity issue, we need more economic information. In this context, information on prices is very important. In the past five years, price has become one of the most important attributes that consumers take into account when purchasing food products. Finally, our results indicate that children’s and households’ lifestyles also play a pivotal role in the prevalence of obesity. Changing lifestyles is not an easy task. However, past literature has shown that community access to healthy food and places for children to play have a positive impact on the reduction of obesity in children. Additional research from social scientists (sociologists, psychologists etc.) is needed to better understand consumers’ behavior and what type of environmental factors would be most effective in changing children’s lifestyles. 

Key Messages: 
· Concerns about childhood obesity have increased over the past few years, as obesity developed during childhood can persist throughout an individual’s lifetime (cohort effect).
· Existing methodological frameworks used to analyze the factors affecting the prevalence of childhood obesity are rather simple for understanding its complex nature.
· This study provides a useful tool to analyze the impact of socioeconomic factors and food habits on childhood obesity.
· Results suggest that children’s and households’ lifestyles play a pivotal role in the prevalence of obesity.
· Policies should be oriented toward changing lifestyles, which would require more multidisciplinary research into reducing childhood obesity in the future.
