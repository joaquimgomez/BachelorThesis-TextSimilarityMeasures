Abstract
Appropriate technologies must be developed for adoption of improved seeds based on the farmers’ preferences and needs. Our 

research identified the farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) as a key determinant for selecting the improved varieties of maize seeds 
and landraces in Chiapas, Mexico. This work also analyzed the farmers’ observed heterogeneity on the basis of their socio-economic 
characteristics. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire from 200 farmers. A proportional choice experiment 
approach was applied using a proportional choice variable, where farmers were asked to state the percentage of preference for different 
alternative varieties in a choice set. The generalized multinomial logit model in WTP-space approach was used. The results suggest that 
the improved seed varieties are preferred over the Creole alternatives, thereby ensuring higher yields, resistance to diseases, and larger 
ear size. For the preference heterogeneity analyses, a latent class model was applied. Three types of farmers were identified: innovators 
(60.5%), transition farmers (29.4%), and conservative farmers (10%). An understanding of farmers’ preferences is useful in designing 
agricultural policies and creating pricing and marketing strategies for the dissemination of quality seeds.

Introduction

In the early 1970s, Mexico experienced a strong 
increase in food production. However, soon after, 
the country gradually lost its self-sufficiency, leading 
to an increased dependence on imports of food and 
agriculture inputs (FAOSTAT, http://faostat.fao.org). 

In 2015, corn (Zea Mays L.) production in Mexico 
was estimated at 24.9 million tonnes, with 2.95 t/ha and 
an increase of 77% in imports (SIAP, 2016). The low 
level of corn productivity in Mexico became a national 
food security issue because corn has been the main food 
product, especially in rural areas with extreme poverty 
and higher marginalization (CIMMYT, http://www.
cimmyt.org/es/seguridad-alimentaria). The annual 

consumption of corn is estimated at 123 kg per capita, 
well above the worldwide average of 16.8 kg per capita 
(FAOSTAT). 

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
has estimated that corn production will not satisfy the 
global demand by 2050, as a result of climate change, 
shortage of production inputs, and emergence of new 
pests and diseases (Harrison, 2002). Consequently, the 
price of basic grains will increase significantly on the 
international market, making the import of corn into 
Mexico very costly (Nelson et al., 2009). Therefore, 
improving corn productivity is indispensable to meet 
the future food demand.

The potential maize production in Mexico is 52 
million tonnes, of which 28 million tonnes could

be achieved in a short term. This increase can be 
reached without increasing the agricultural land use or 
without using transgenic maize. The use of improved 
technology, highly productive seed varieties, and 
modifying the farming practices would be sufficient 
(Turrent et al., 2012). A further increase in productivity 
is hard to achieve as new farming technology and highly 
productive varieties have been already adopted by large-
scale farmers. The main challenge hinges on small-scale 
farmers adopting innovative farming practices via more 
efficient use of the available resources and capital. Such 
agricultural technologies include the use of improved 
varieties, modern agricultural practices, and sustainable 
use of chemical fertilizers. According to Copeland & 
McDonald (2001), the use of improved varieties is the 
most effective means to increase crop yield and quality. 

Over the years, the federal government of Mexico 
has promoted breeding programs through a variety 
of public and private institutions. However, there is 
a lack of coordination among the formal institutions 
engaged in research and development activities, as well 
as among these institutions, farmers, and private firms 
(Spielman et al., 2011). As a result, the development 
of improved varieties is independent of the preferences 
of farmers, especially in marginal areas (Hellin et al., 
2006), leading to a lower rate of adoption (Luna et al., 
2011). 

An ideal example is the state of Chiapas, which 
is mainly characterized by an agricultural system 
dominated by small farmers and low yields of 1.6 t/
ha (SIAP, 2016). Furthermore, Chiapas has the largest 
demand of corn seed and the highest potential for 
production increase. However, it is still one of the 
states with the lowest implementation of improved 
seeds (30%), due to the farmers’ lower perception of 
advantages in this technology (INEGI, 2015).

Bellon (1991) suggested that the preferences 
and priorities of farmers are highly heterogeneous. 
Therefore, many factors may affect farmers’ choice of 
seeds, including final product attributes, socioeconomic 
variables, opinions and attitudes, risk perception, 
sociocultural environment, and access to information 
(Hellyer et al., 2012). 

Morris & Bellon (2004) noted that plant breeders 
often have weak links to the end users. Plant breeders 
receive rigorous instruction in the theory and practice of 
crop improvement and have little knowledge of survey 
methods to elicit structured feedback from farmers. As 
a result, what a conventional plant breeder considers 
important might not correspond with the preferences 
of the majority of farmers in an agricultural region. 
Consequently, the breeding program may represent a 
non-optimal combination of characteristics (Morris 
& Bellon, 2004). Accordingly, the best strategy to 

increase the adoption of improved seeds is considering 
the preferences of farmers, their production constraints, 
and what really influences their decisions in farming 
activities (Sibiya et al., 2013). 

In recent years, participatory plant breeding programs 
that seek to recover the participation of the farmer in 
breeding programs have become relevant. Notably, the 
inclusion of farmers’ opinions and preferences in the 
design and development of  technological innovations is 
scarce in Mexico (Herrera et al., 2002; Birol et al., 2006, 
2009, 2012; Castillo & Chávez, 2013). Specifically, 
in the State of Chiapas, some research regarding 
preferences toward maize attributes have been carried 
out through a participatory method and following non-
parametric techniques (Bellon & Risopoulos, 2001; 
Hellin et al., 2006; Martínez et al., 2006). 

In this context, the objective of this research was 
twofold: (1) to identify key attributes and factors that 
determine the choice of maize seeds by local farmers, 
and (2) to estimate farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) 
for each descriptor and their heterogeneity on the 
basis of their socio-economic characteristics and 
heterogeneity. 

Furthermore, among the methods available for 
preference analysis, the discrete choice experiment 
(DCE) is the most popular due to its validated economic 
theory. In this study, a variation of the DCE was used. 
The proportional choice experiment (PCE) approach 
was used to measure the WTP for a set of attributes that 
characterize maize seeds. We estimated the generalized 
multinomial logit (GMNL) in WTP space model. 
Furthermore, preference heterogeneity was assessed 
using the latent class (LC) modeling approach. 

Our research provides specific information on 
farmers’ preferences in seed selection in Mexico, 
which will help promote a “social breeding” program 
for small farmers. Second, this paper contributes to 
DCE studies by introducing the PCE as an alternative 
to the traditional approach by using the choice variable 
as a proportional in the modeling approach obtained by 
asking farmers the percentage of the different corn seed 
preferred in a choice set. 

Methods 

The choice experiment

 The current literature provides several tools designed 
to analyze farmers’ preferences for maize crop such as 
participative research (Bellon & Risopoulos, 2001; 
Ferro et al., 2013), conjoint analysis (Makokha et al., 
2007; Hirpa et al., 2012), and the use of descriptive 
analyses (Sibiya et al., 2013).

In the early 1980s, the DCE was introduced as a 

technique for modeling consumer choices (Louviere, 
2001). The DCE relies on the Lancaster’s theory of 
value (Lancaster, 1966), which proposes that the utility 
of a product is decomposed into separable utilities for 
their characteristics. It is also based on the random 
utility theory (Thurstone, 1927), which proposes that 
subjects choose among alternatives according to a 
utility function with two main components: a systematic 
(observable) component and a random error term (non-
observable). The DCE has become the most sought 
after tool for analyzing individual behavior and choice. 
While four main choice modeling alternatives (choice 
experiments, contingent ranking, contingent rating, 
and paired comparisons) are available, only the choice 
experiment provides outcomes consistent with standard 
welfare economics (Hanley et al., 2001). 

The DCE was first used in communication and 
transport studies (Louviere, 1981); however, its use 
gradually spread to other areas such as market research 
(Bastell & Louviere, 1991), environmental evaluation 
(Hanley et al., 1998), identifying attributes of products 
influencing consumers (Lusk et al., 2003), and 
agricultural multifunctionality (Kallas & Gómez-Limón, 
2007). Windle & Rolfe (2005) used this methodology 
to analyze alternatives for agricultural diversification in 
Australia. This method has also found use in organic 
agriculture (Meas et al., 2015), food traceability (Wu et 
al., 2015), maintenance programs for plants and animals 
(Roessler et al., 2008; Asrat et al., 2010; Birol et al., 
2012), and provision of ecosystem services (Villanueva 
et al., 2017). However, empirical applications of DCE 
regarding farming innovations are few. 

Furthermore, Birol & Villalba (2006) noted that a 
successful application of DCE in developing countries 
such as Mexico depends on a careful selection of 
election sets and an effective compilation of field 
data. In Mexico, choice experiments have been used 
in natural reserves (Tudela et al., 2009), trait selection 
of pig breeds (Scarpa et al., 2003), and assessment of 
transgenic corn crops in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, 
and Oaxaca (Birol & Villalba, 2006).

The choice modelling approach aims to identify the 
consumers’ indirect utility function associated with 
the product attributes by examining the trade-offs they 
consider when making choices at a retail outlet. According 
to the random utility theory, the utility of an individual, n, 
choosing an alternative, j , is the sum of both 
components: , which is a function of the characteristics 
of the alternative ( ), individual characteristics (Sn), as 
well as another random component, . Furthermore, the 
individual, n, will choose the alternative, j, if it provides 
a utility that is superior over any other alternative, i, 
available in the choice set.

To predict a subject’s preference for attribute k, 
we need to define the “probability of choice” that 
an individual n chooses the alternative i rather than 
the alternative j (for any i and j within choice set T). 
McFadden (1974) developed an econometric model 
that formalized respondents’ decision-making process. 
This model is often referred to as the multinomial logit 
(MNL) model, which is considered the base model 
for DCE. In this model, the utility to person n from 
choosing alternative j on choice scenario t is given by:

    

[1]

where njtx   is a vector of observed attributes of alternative 
j, β   is a vector of mean attribute utilities, and njtε  is 
the “idiosyncratic” error term that follows independent 
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) type 1 extreme value 
distribution with scale parameter nσ  .

The probability ( )j ntP X   that an individual n will 
choose alternative j among other alternatives in an array 
of choice set T is formulated as follows:

         
 

[2]

where Xnt is the vector of attributes of all alternatives 
1,  ,   j J= … . In the case of estimating a MNL, the scale 

parameter  nσ  is normalized to 1 for identification.
However, this model imposes homogeneity in 

preferences for the observed attributes. Thus, only 
average attributes’ utilities can be estimated. Therefore, 
the MIXL (Mixed Logit Model) has been introduced to 
investigate the unobserved heterogeneity. However, it has 
been argued that much of the preference heterogeneity 
in MIXL can be are better captured by the scale term 
and thus known as “scale heterogeneity” (Louviere 
& Mayer, 2007; Louviere et al., 2008). According to 
Balogh et al. (2016), the scale heterogeneity might 
be interpreted as the variation of randomness in the 
decision-making process over respondents, i.e., the 
variance of the error term (and hence the degree of 
certainty) may differ across individual decision-makers. 
This is especially relevant for the stated preference data, 
where respondents interpret choice situations differently 
and pay varying levels of attention to the task presented 
(Train & Weeks, 2005).

Among the various modeling approaches that include 
scale heterogeneity specification, Fiebig et al. (2010) 
proposed the GMNL model. According to this model, 
the utility of an individual, n, for selecting alternative, j, 
in a choice set, t, is given by

where γ is a mixing parameter between 0 and 1, whose 
value represents the level of independence or interaction 
between the scale term σn and the heterogeneity around 
the attributes’ estimates (nn). Fiebig et al. (2010) 
proposed that nσ  follows a log-normal distribution with 
mean equal to 1 and standard deviation τ . The GMNL 
estimates the τ  term that captures scale heterogeneity 
across respondents. Further details about GMNL 
specification and estimation can be found in Fiebig et 
al. (2010). 

The usual procedure for calculating the WTP is 
estimating the distribution of utility coefficients and 
then deriving the distribution of WTP, which is the ratio 
of coefficients. However, Scarpa et al. (2008) described 
a method to estimate the distribution of WTP directly, 
which fits the data better, reduces the incidence of 
exceedingly large WTP values, and provides the analyst 
with greater control over the distribution of WTP. In 
the present study, we used the GMNL model in the 
WTP-space. In this case, the GMNL is reparametrized 
(Greene & Hensher, 2010) by separating the variable 
price, ρ, and its coefficient, βρ, n. By standardizing the 
price coefficient to 1, the WTP can be directly estimated. 
In this case, the mixing parameter (γ) turns to be a fixed 
parameter.

Finally, the DCE approach is similar to the PCE 
method used in this study (Greene, 2012). The 
only difference is that the choice variable used was 
proportional data rather than individual choice data. 
That is, the choice variable consists of a set of sample 
proportions with values ranging from 0 to 1. This 
variable should sum to 1 over the alternatives in the 
choice set. Observed proportions may be equal to 1 or 
0 for some individuals if they answered 100% for some 
alternatives within the choice set.

Regarding the analysis of preference heterogeneity, 
different techniques can be used. Within the choice 
experiment approach, the socioeconomic variables are 
typically interacted with the attributes. The LC model 
is one of the popular approaches for analyzing observed 
heterogeneity. Besides the relevance of socioeconomic 
variables in describing preferences, this model also 
provides a way to obtain information regarding the 
different segments of the market. To illustrate, the 
model begins by contrasting the “segmentability” of the 
population studied. The LC determines the probability 
of an individual belonging to a certain class and the 
probability of choosing one alternative conditional 
on the preferences within each class. Further details 
regarding this model are available in Greene & Hensher 
(2003). In this study, we used the LC to analyze 

farmers’ preferences. The “best” number of classes to be 
extracted was based on the comparison of the Bayesian 
information indicator (BIC), McFadden pseudo R2, and 
plausibility of the results.

Empirical application

Data 

Data was collected from face to face survey with 
a sample of 200 farmers that was carried out in 
January and March of 2015; the sample was stratified 
by seed variety (creole and improved) and postal 
districts. Also, the interviews were made in a zone 
of potential corn production in the state of Chiapas: 
the towns of Villaflores, Chiapa de Corzo, Villacorzo, 
and La Concordia. In order to determine the sample 
size, information were used regarding the farmers 
who were registered in the Programa de Apoyos 
Directos al Campo (PROCAMPO), a program which 
is intended to promote and finance agriculture in the 
counties mentioned above. Notably, farmers enrolled 
in this program represent 98% of total corn farmers 
(SIAP, 2016). The sample size was calculated as finite 
populations with 95% as significance level NS and an 
error of 6.87%. Table 1 represents the survey technical 
sheet. 

Following Kallas et al. (2010), the questionnaire was 
organized in two sections: the first included questions 
about the characteristics of the farmers (gender, 
education, age, experience), farm structure (location, 
farm size, soil type), farm management (input use 
and crop diversification), exogenous factors (output 
and input prices, market size, subsidies, information 
access, transition costs); the second part included the 
different choice sets to carry out the choice experiment. 
Analyses of the econometric models were performed 
with NLOGIT 5.0 software.

The applied proportional choice experiment (PCE)

The application of the PCE can be summarized 
into the following steps: First, the characterization 
of the decision problem was predefined in terms of 
changes to the existing state, status quo, and base 
reference point. In this study, we placed values on 
the possible changes in the preferences of attributes 
when selecting the maize seeds and WTP for each 
seed type. The status quo in our case was, therefore, 
defined by the supply of improved and creole seeds. 

Next, for the definition of attributes and their 
corresponding levels, we followed different studies 
and sources of information. To begin with, we analyzed

the current farmer preferences when selecting crop 
seeds. The attributes that the farmers took into account 
when selecting a new variety are the corn ear shape 
(Ferro et al., 2008), number of grains per row (Ferro 
et al., 2008, 2013), corn ear filling arrangement (Ferro 
et al., 2013), grain color (Soleri & Cleveland, 2001; 
Benz et al., 2007), ear size (Ferro et al., 2013; Sibiya 
et al., 2013), ear height (Ferro et al., 2008), ear weight 
(Ferro et al., 2008; Sibiya et al., 2013), resistance to 
disease (Ferro et al., 2008), ear diameter (Ferro et al., 
2008), ear tightness (Ferro et al., 2008), stem thickness 
(Ferro et al., 2008), number of rows per cob (Sibiya et 
al., 2013; Ferro et al., 2013), color of straw (Ferro et al., 
2008), plant height (Ferro et al., 2008, 2013), number 
of corn ears (Ferro et al., 2008; Sibiya et al., 2013), cob 
diameter (Herrera et al., 2002), early maturity (Sibiya 
et al., 2013), yield (Birol et al., 2012; Ferro et al., 2013; 
Sibiya et al., 2013), grain size (Bellon & Risopoulos, 
2001; Sibiya et al., 2013), flavor (Sibiya et al., 2013), 
tolerance to drought (Bellon et al., 2006; Sibiya et 
al., 2013), tolerance to excessive rain (Bellon et al., 
2006; Sibiya et al., 2013), resistance to putrefaction of 
the corn ear (Bellon et al., 2006; Sibiya et al., 2013), 
duration (cycle of growth) (Bellon et al., 2006; Sibiya et 
al., 2013), plague resistance (Bellon et al., 2006; Sibiya 
et al., 2013), resistance to storage plagues (Bellon et al., 
2006; Sibiya et al., 2013), and dough yield (Bellon et al., 
2006). The product price is another important extrinsic 
attribute affecting the purchase decision (Lockshin et 
al., 2006). 

The second step was to conduct a discussion 
group with researchers from the Instituto Nacional 
de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias 

(INIFAP, Mexico)1  to reduce the primary information 
obtained. Also, this group evaluated and verified 
the suitability of attributes. Subsequently, a pilot 
questionnaire was applied to test the validity of the 
attributes and to determine the level of the price 
vector. 

Regarding the cost attributes and levels, the price 
vector was based on the average prices for a bag of 20 
kg of seed, provided by the INIFAP and the Secretaría 
de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca 
y Alimentación2. The price levels in the choice sets 
were selected to cover the central 90% of the observed 
values. However, the price was correlated with the 
type of seeds used. We used a labeled choice design 
to solve this problem, where each alternative choice 
was defined by the type of seed used. In Table 2, the 
main attributes and their levels are presented. 

For the experimental design, forced and labeled 
choice sets representing the different varieties of 
maize seed were used. An efficient block design was 
used (ChoiceMetrics, 2014), leading to 27 choice sets 
classified into three groups. Respondents were asked 
to set their preferences for the different alternatives. 
No evidence was found in the pilot or main survey 
preferring to reject all corn types in a choice set. 

Before beginning the survey, the choice experiment 
was explained orally and in writing. Respondents 
were asked to set the percentage of preference for the 
different varieties of seed for maize cultivation this 
year; thus, the dependent variable in this study was a 
proportion of two mutually exclusive alternatives in 
each choice set. An example of a choice set is shown 
in Fig. S1 [suppl].

Farmers’ preferences on improved seeds

 Table 3 represents a summary of the major 
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents. 
The proportion of each stratum is similar across the 
population of farmers in the geographical area surveyed.

Results of the GMNL model in the WTP-space are 
shown in Table 4. The model showed a goodness-of-fit 
with an acceptable value of McFadden pseudo R2 that 
is equal to 0.169, similar to other studies that analyzed 
farmers’ preferences through choice experiments (Birol 
& Villalba, 2006; Kallas & Gómez-Limón, 2007; Ortega 
et al., 2016). The log likelihood ratio was also highly 
significant at 99%. Results showed that the estimated 
coefficients of the majority of the levels of attributes are 
statistically significant. This result confirms that most 
of the attributes and levels considered in the model 
are significant and essential in predicting farmers’ 
preferences. 

The estimated parameters directly provide 
information about the WTP. These estimates should be 
multiplied by 100 as the price variable was divided by 
100 during the estimation. Farmers showed a positive 
WTP for crop yield. The same trend occurred among 
the attributes of resistance to disease and ear length. 
Corn growers were willing to pay $15.80 for a 20 kg 

bag of improved corn seed to gain one centimeter in 
corn ear length. These results are in agreement with the 
findings of Kassie et al. (2017). Maize varieties with 
medium- and large-sized cobs are preferred as the cob 
size has a lot to do with grain yield and marketability.

Furthermore, farmers were willing to pay $2.90 more 
to gain 1% of resistance to disease in the maize crop, 
and $39.89 more per bag to increase the crop yield by 
1 ton. However, unexpectedly, the respondents did not 
give importance to the attribute “height of the corn,”, 
despite the problems that this characteristic can cause. 
Nevertheless, in conformity with the finding of Hellin 
& Bellon (2007), farmers gave more importance to corn 
stems for making fences and leaves as forage. Therefore, 
any corn type can be grown for forage, but the ones with 
a higher yield of biomass are the tall varieties. On the 
other hand, improved varieties have a little bud sport 
and usually produce less forage per unit of area (Estrada 
et al., 2015); thus, farmers are willing to accept a tall 
plant as long as it has a high yield and wind-resistant 
stalk. 

In addition, the estimated coefficient of the alternative 
specific constant (ASC) of the improved corn was not 
significant. This result shows that the attributes and 
levels that were not included in describing corn may not 
be relevant.

Our results are consistent with other studies that 
considered high yields, resistance to diseases, and lower 
price as main drivers for selecting improved seeds

(Asrat et al., 2010; Sibiya et al., 2013; Waldman et al., 
2017). 

According to Ajambo et al. (2010), corn farmers 
in Uganda preferred drought-resilient varieties, with 
a short growth cycle and higher resistance to pests 
and diseases. Those farmers were willing to pay Ush 
200–5,000/kg for a variety with such characteristics (1 
US$ = 2,200 Ugandan USh). Comparatively, Kassie et 
al. (2014) pointed out that Zimbabwean farmers were 
willing to pay 1.75 times more to ensure tolerance to 
drought and a harvest of one more ton of crop. It was 
also found that producers were willing to pay 8.3 times 
the value to get a change in size from a small corn ear 
to a bigger one. Furthermore, the seed cost was also an 
important factor describing preferences. Our results 
are similar to those of other studies where the cost of 
seed is a main determining factor when choosing a 
variety (Kyeyune & Turner, 2016). Kassie et al. (2017) 
indicated that the trait-based promotion and marketing 
of varieties constitutes a suitable strategy for the 
adoption of improved corn seeds.

Finally, regarding the scale factor, the estimate was 
high and significant, which confirmed a high level of 
unobserved heterogeneity and uncertainty in selecting 
the varieties. The results of our study show that the 
farmers demonstrate a high level of product uncertainty 
and randomness when choosing corn seed (Fleming et 
al., 2016). 

Farmers’ observed heterogeneity toward corn 
seed preference

A LC model was used to analyze farmers’ observed 
heterogeneity. This model allowed us to classify corn 
growers into three types according to their preferences. 
The optimal number of segments, the BIC, the pseudo 
R2, and probability of the result of each segment were 
computed (Hu et al., 2004). Therefore, the LC model 
with three classes was selected as the best fit. Out of  200 
farmers surveyed, we found that 60.5% are innovators, 
29.4% are transition farmers, and 10% are conservative 
(Table 5).

The first latent class was innovators who gave much 

importance to seed yield, resistance to diseases, and 
price. This segment is the most price-sensitive. The 
second latent class, transition farmers, considered yield 
as the most important attribute, followed by a lower 
preference for intensive seed type. Our results were 
similar to those of Ortega et al. (2016) who reported that 
Malawian farmers have a strong positive preference for 
maize grain yield. The third latent class, conservative 
farmers, considered improved seeds as unimportant; 
instead, they preferred creole seeds and gave importance 
to a large corn ear and seed price. 

For classes 1 and 2, the ASCs were positive, but 
the ASC of class 3 were negative, which could have 
been due to the residual utility associated with the 
non-observed attributes. Farmers belonging to class 
3 exhibited a negative utility for the improved seed. 
Farmers belonging to either class 1 or class 2 had a 
strong preference for improved seeds if these met the 
preferred attributes. 

Finally, the price had negative effects; that is, the 
lower the price, the higher is the utility for farmers, 
and so a normal demand was consistent. It is important 
to stress how important fertilizers are when using 
improved seeds, because fertilizers are necessary to 
obtain better yields. The amount of fertilizer used is 
considerably higher when using improved seeds than 

when growing creole varieties (Bernard et al., 2010). In 
this respect, Gecho & Punjabi (2011) pointed out that the 
price of fertilizer lowers the probability of the adoption 
of improved corn. Furthermore, Salgado & Miranda 
(2010) stressed that the increase in corn productivity in 
Mexico in the coming years will be subject to the price 
of fertilizers.

Profile of corn farmer segments

Knowing the types of farmers who belong to each 
segment can help in the establishment of well-defined 
agricultural policies and local intervention strategies. 
To do so, we first described each segment using the 
sociodemographic characteristics. These characteristics 
included the farmer’s age, number of generations in 
agriculture, number of generations in corn farming, year 
responsible for managing the exploitation, and year when 
corn farming began. Besides these sociodemographic 
variables, we also collected data relating to land 
management such as seed being used, corn sales, total 
surface, yield, total sales, distance from home to the 
exploitation field, and soil quality. In our study, soil quality 
was determined using a 11-point scale, where 0 suggested 
that the farmer considers the soil to be of bad quality, and 
10 suggested that the farmer considers the soil to be of 
excellent quality.

Attitudes, opinions, and perceptions toward 

risk also play an important role in determining the 
adoption of seed varieties (Howley et al., 2015). 
Thus, in our profiling analysis, we also included the 
perception towards improved seed and risk attitude. 
Risk attitudes and opinions toward improved seeds 
were assessed via two principal component analyses 
(PCA) following the previous studies (Asrat et al., 
2010; Birol et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Valdivia et 
al., 2015). Table 6 shows the profiles of different 
segments. 

According to our analyses, innovators were 56 
years on average. They started cultivating corn in 
1980 and showed acceptance of improved seeds. 
These farmers mainly cultivated improved seeds 
with a higher yield per hectare and achieved higher 
sales. These farmers own more land, consistent with 
Kalinda et al. (2014) finding that improved corn 
seed use is directly related to the size of land owned. 
However, these farmers are risk acceptors, as they 
had more resources to mitigate the effects of risks 
when adopting new technologies. Transaction costs 
per surface unit were lower than that for farmers 
owning small areas, consistent with the findings of 
Paredes & Martin (2007) study.

In contrast, transition farmers were aged 55 on 
average and were the fourth generation to grow corn. 
They gave less importance to soil quality, compared 
to other classes. They were, on average, risk takers 
and cultivated improved and creole seeds, depending 
on accessibility. They tried to use improved seeds on 
an experimental scale in their farms.

Finally, conservative farmers were 67 years 
on average and had more experience in crop 
management (they have been growing corn since 
1971). This group of farmers used 89.9% of corn 
production for sales and the remainder for their 
own consumption. Most of them used creole seeds 
with lower yield, implemented smaller crops, and 
traveled a longer distance from their homes to their 
fields. These farmers were risk-averse, wherein 
their family members represented the main source 
of farming information. Thus, access to information 
can reduce uncertainty about the possible results of 
using new technology, as also noted by Honra et al. 
(2007). For this reason, it is important that research, 
extension, and agricultural education work together 
to allow farmers to understand and appreciate the 
characteristics of new varieties (Rivera & Romero, 
2003). 

Our results were similar to those of Villanueva 
et al. (2017), who compared the characteristics of 
three groups of olive farmers in Andalusia, Spain 
(protesters, very high takers, and participants).

Conclusions

The increase of corn productivity is the fundamental 
challenge for growers who work non-irrigated land in 
Mexico. Improved seeds, together with technological 
innovations at the farm level, can substantially improve 
productivity that may help satisfy the national demand, 
as well as improve living conditions and sustainability for 
farmers in rural areas. Therefore, it is essential to increase 
the adoption rate of improved corn seeds. The low adoption 
rate of improved seeds in the area is mainly due to the high 
cost of the seeds and the fact that improved varieties are 
designed without the farmers’ opinions and real needs 
taken into consideration. This negligence can lead to 
varieties that lack the attributes preferred by farmers. 

Our results confirmed that the decision to adopt 
improved corn varieties is mainly based on WTP for 
several different attributes; thus, it is important to first 
define farmer preference and WTP for corn attributes and 
then design varieties that meet their requirements. 

The application of the DCE and the GMNL in the WTP-
space approach showed that farmers in the analyzed area 
preferred a high-yield variety, resistance to diseases, and 
corn with bigger cob size. Farmers are willing to adopt 
a variety only if it includes attributes that represent their 
preferences. Results also implied that the improvement 
of crops and the adoption of the improved varieties in 
these communities might be feasible. This improvement 
can be done through farmers’ participation in the process 
of generation and selection of seeds to ensure that their 
priorities and needs are incorporated into the existing local 
varieties, or the creation of new ones. 

Regarding the preference heterogeneity analysis, results 
showed that farmers in Chiapas are grouped into three 
segments and differentiated according to their preferences 
for improved seeds. The advanced age of the conservative 
producers, combined with a low level of education and the 
small area available for planting, are limiting factors for the 
adoption of technological innovations and the productive 
growth of corn. The conservative and transitional regional 
producers are still unaware of the economic benefits of 
improved varieties, their availability, and accessibility. 
For this reason, we highlight the importance of redirecting 
extensions in Mexico to make it more efficient and 
effective in order to publicize the benefits. 

A more intensive program of demonstrations and tests 
at the farm level is justifiable for farmers in transition and 
conservative categories. On the other hand, for the group 
of innovators, it is necessary to focus on improving the 
availability of better seeds. Although in the last twenty 
years there have been many changes and institutional 
innovations in the system of agricultural research and 
extension in Mexico, these have not been sufficient. Our 
analysis clearly indicates that most farmers have had

limited contact with the extension system. This limitation 
contributes to a negative perception of the use of improved 
seeds. Furthermore, we found that farmers are only familiar 
with improved seed distributed through transnational 
corporations. In our sample of farmers, none were 
aware of the possibility of purchasing improved seeds 
produced by government institutions. 

Similarly, it is important to mention that our 
conclusions relate only to the case study analyzed 
in the state of Chiapas. To be able to reach further 
conclusions, we recommend extending these 
analyses to other corn- producing states. These 
analyses would provide comparisons that would be 
helpful in understanding the variation of demand 
for corn attributes, as well as the heterogeneity of 
social preferences. Future research should consider 
a deeper evaluation of the attitudes towards risk and 
a detailed assessment of the system's expansion in 
Mexico. Additional research is also needed to assess 
impact evaluations of programs of improvement of 
maize in Mexico. 

Our results confirm the need to design differentiated 
agricultural policies, at the local level, that take 
into account the different groups and preferences. 
However, the lack of such policies regarding the 
adoption of agricultural technologies and improved 
varieties in Mexico represent one of the challenging 
issues for agricultural authorities. In this way, our 
study contributes to the planning of further research, 
validation, transference, and adoption of future 
technologies. In all cases, it is worth mentioning 
that the results should be taken with caution because 
of the sample characteristics and the relatively low 
goodness of fit of the model to data.

Moreover, future application of the choice 
experiment to the design and targeting of modern 
crop varieties should carefully consider sample 
composition and size to permit the estimation of 
relevant sub-models for desired farmer segments. 
The reduction of investment in agricultural research 
in Mexico is likely to worsen the disparity between 
rural and urban life. Agricultural research can 
potentially improve rural livelihoods, uniquely 
addressing farmers’ problems and allowing for a 
generation of more efficient technologies.
