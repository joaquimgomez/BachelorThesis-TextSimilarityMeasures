In this paper we analyze consumers’ preferences for Gilthead Sea bream in Catalonia by means of the Choice Experiment (CE) 
methodology. Data were obtained from a structured questionnaire applied to 160 Gilthead Sea bream consumers. Results show that 
consumers’ preferences for this species are heterogeneous. Heterogeneity has been analyzed by means of the Latent Class Model, 
identified three groups of consumers.

Justification  

The second farmed fish traded in Catalonia is the Gilthead Sea bream. It is also the first farmed fish 
produced in the region (DAAM, 2014). In Mercabarna, the main wholesale market in Catalonia (which 
commercializes around 45.0% of the fish that is sold in the region), the Gilthead Sea bream reached 
24.5% of the sales of fresh farmed fish (MERCABARNA, statistics 2010). In the last years, its 
consumption trend was decreasing. However, in the more recent years, a recovering is been shown 
(MAGRAMA, 2014). 

Gilthead Sea bream can be found in several presentation formats in Catalonia, being the most common 
the whole fresh fish. However, other presentations are being introduced such as frozen, filleted vacuum 
packaged and pre-cooked, amongst others.  In this context, it is relevant to explore consumer’s expected 
preferences and heterogeneity towards Gilthead Sea bream in Catalonia. By this way we will be able to 
better reach this market segment and their preferences for the major characteristic of the product. With 
this purpose, our work considers the following descriptors of the Gilthead Sea bream:  

(1) Sea bream’s Presentation, considering it fresh as a whole piece or in fillets, and frozen in fillets. 

(2) Origin, which will help to determine the necessity of promoting a regional label for product 
differentiation. For this attribute three origins were chosen, including Catalonia, Andalusia and 
Greece, as a foreign origin; and 

 (3) Production system, which will allow assessing the promotion of a farmed product as a desirable 
attribute, 

(4) Price 

To reach our goal, the choice experiment (CE) will be used as a suitable method to asses a complex food 
product.  

Methodology  

The CE belong to the stated preference type of methods and are based on the creation of a hypothetical 
market for the analyzed goods and services. The conceptual foundations of CE rely on Lancaster’s 
Theory of Value (Lancaster, 1966), which proposes that utilities for goods can be decomposed into 
separable utilities for their characteristics or attributes, and Random Utility Theory (Thurstone, 1927).  

In this sense, the CE involve the characterization of the object of study through a series of descriptors 
(attributes and levels). These are combined by means of experimental design to create different products, 
which are frequently called alternatives. The alternatives are grouped constructing “choice sets” which 
represent changing in one or more attributes. One of the attributes is usually defined in monetary terms 
(frequently the price) allowing the researcher to obtain the monetary values associated with attributes and 
attribute levels.  

The application of the CE implies the presentation of an array of choice sets representing different 
possible states of the good of interest. Individuals are asked to select which alternative they prefer and 



whether they would buy it, while implicitly making a trade-off between descriptors. An example of a 
choice set can be seen in Figure 1. 

 
 

Figure 1. Example of a choice set 
 
A structured questionnaire was designed and 160 Gilthead Sea bream consumers were interviewed. To 
make the analysis affordable, an orthogonal fractional factorial design was carried out which considered 
only all attributes’ main effects. This enabled to reduce the number of the 34x34 (6,561) possible 
combinations (choice sets) to 9 (Dawes and Corrigan, 1974). 

Of the probabilistic choice models, the basic Conditional Logit Model (CLM) (McFadden 1974) is the 
most frequently used for dealing with CE data. However, the CLM only allows to estimate preferences at 
the aggregated level and, thus, heterogeneity is unobserved. Therefore, in this analysis we also applied the 
Latent Class model (LCM), which allows identifying latent segments (or clusters) on the basis of the 
individuals’ utilities of the attributes and levels. Later, these segments can be characterized by their 
individual variables through ANOVA and Ҳ2 tests. 

 
Results and Discussion  

Consumers in Catalonia reveal no preference for the production method, i.e. aquaculture or wild capture. 
The most significant attributes for consumers’ welfare are presentation and price (Table 1). Catalonian 
consumers have a high preference for a fresh product rather than frozen. If the product is fresh, both 
presentations (filleted and the whole piece) are equally liked. For the origin, Catalonian consumers have a 
high preference for a national Gilthead Sea bream, especially Andalucian.  

Table 1. Results of the Conditional Logit Model 

The heterogeneity analysis identified three latent classes (table 2): 

The first latent class groups older female consumers who do prefer traditional presentations and, thus, 
they choose for a fresh whole piece. A regional origin (Catalan) is their favorite. Furthermore, they state 
that they would pay a premium price for it. Unfortunately for the Catalan aquaculture sector this group 
only represents a minority of the population (9.6 % of the sample). We have named this group as “Older 
Housewives”. 

The second group, identified as “Out of Duty Fish Consumers”, consumes fish mainly because it is 
related to health and diet issues. Therefore, there is not so much pleasure elicited from fish consumption. 
They are younger consumers and prefer a convenience product, such as filleted Gilthead Sea bream 
(ready to cook). They represent the major consumers group (59.0% of the sample). 

The third group identified is used to eating fish since they were little (at home). Therefore, fish 
consumption is a habit and they enjoy it. They consume Gilthead Sea Bream in all ways (fresh, frozen, 



filleted, national, foreign…) not showing any preference for a determined level of an attribute. They are 
the heaviest users and we have named them as “Traditionally Consumers”.

In order to conclude, it is noteworthy to highlight that aquaculture products are well introduced in 
Catalonia and accepted by the consumer. None of the identified groups is influenced by the production 
method when buying Gilt head Sea Bream. Even the group “Older housewives”, which could be expected 
to be more reluctant, shows acceptance towards aquaculture.
