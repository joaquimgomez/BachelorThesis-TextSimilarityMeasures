Introduction

Preference elicitation methods have been extensi-
vely used by economists and market researchers to de-
termine consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for spe-
cific product attributes. Discrete choice modeling is a
preference elicitation method that has been widely used
in previous research (Lusk & Shroeder, 2004; Ding
et al., 2005; among many others). Initially almost all
researchers applying discrete choice models assume
that error variances are homogeneous over individuals
by the application of Multinomial Logit (MNL), Con-
ditional Logit (CL), and Nested Logit (NL). However,

evidence of preference heterogeneity in both revealed
preference data (Hensher, 2008) and stated preference
data (Hess & Rose, 2009) is increasing. Failure to
account for preference heterogeneity may not only
result in poor model performance (i.e., generating an
incorrect standard error and biased parameter esti-
mates) but also affect elasticities, WTP measures and
substitution patterns, all of which could lead to pro-
blems in the reliability of model results (Hynes et al.,
2008; Hess et al., 2010).

Therefore, methods that account for preference
heterogeneity have received a significant amount of
attention in recent literature (Campbell et al., 2010;

Revealing additional preference heterogeneity with an extended

Abstract

Methods that account for preference heterogeneity have received a significant amount of attention in recent literature.
Most of them have focused on preference heterogeneity around the mean of the random parameters, which has been
specified as a function of socio-demographic characteristics. This paper aims at analyzing consumers’ preferences
towards extra-virgin olive oil in Catalonia using a methodological framework with two novelties over past studies:
1) it accounts for both preference heterogeneity around the mean and the variance; and 2) it considers both socio-
demographic characteristics of consumers as well as their attitudinal factors. Estimated coefficients and moments of
willingness to pay (WTP) distributions are compared with those obtained from alternative Random Parameter Logit
(RPL) models. Results suggest that the proposed framework increases the goodness-of-fit and provides more useful
insights for policy analysis. The most important attributes affecting consumers’ preferences towards extra virgin olive
oil are the price and the product’s origin. The consumers perceive the organic olive oil attribute negatively, as they
think that it is not worth paying a premium for a product that is healthy in nature.

Additional key words: preference heterogeneity; attitudinal factors; discrete choice model; extra-vigin olive oil;
willingness to pay.

Greene & Hensher, 2013). Among the most relevant
we can cite: 1) the use of segmentation strategies
(Shen, 2010); 2) the inclusion of interaction effects to
explain sources of heterogeneity (Mtimet & Albisu,
2006); 3) the use of random parameter estimates,
assuming preference coeff icients to be randomly
distributed across individuals (Revelt & Train, 1998);
and 4) the combination of interaction effects and ran-
dom parameters (Hensher & Greene, 2003), or seg-
mentation strategies and random parameters (Greene
& Hensher, 2013). 

Among these approaches, the estimation of a Ran-
dom Parameter Logit Model (RPL) (Revelt & Train,
1998) to obtain WTP estimates for food attributes has
become increasingly popular. The RPL model relies
on the relaxation of the three main limitations of con-
ventional logit models: 1) it allows for random prefe-
rence variation across individuals through the distribu-
tion of random parameters; 2) it relaxes the assumption
of independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA), and
3) it allows for correlation among unobserved factors
over time (Train, 2003). 

However, the RPL also has some limitations. Indeed,
although the RPL model uses continuous (i.e., normal,
log-normal or triangular) distributions for individual
tastes to account for preference heterogeneity, it does
not identify the heterogeneity source. Additionally, the
RPL estimated parameters (βki = βk + σkϑki), depend on
the so-called individual specific heterogeneities (ϑki)
which follows a normal distribution with zero mean and
a standard deviation of one (Hensher & Greene, 2003),
and σk, the standard deviation of the distribution of the
estimated parameter around its mean. Therefore, if the
product σkϑkiis small, the estimated parameters across
individuals will be very similar. Furthermore, Lenk &
DeSarbo (2000) and Scarpa & Thiene (2005) have
shown that although the RPL model provides an
interesting way to account for preference heterogeneity,
it might be inadequate if different groups of individuals
with different group-specif ic preferences exist1. To
overcome such limitations, Greene et al. (2006)
extended the Random Parameter Logit model (GHR-
RPL) to account for heterogeneity around both the mean
and the variance of the parameter distributions and
illustrated the implications on the moments of the WTP. 

The traditional approach to identify the preference
heterogeneity is to directly include the individual ob-
servable socio-demographic characteristics in the uti-
lity function. However, Morey & Rossmann (2003)
showed that this procedure could be very restrictive as
it assumes that some segments, which seem to have the
same characteristics, have the same preferences. Although
improving the model goodness-of-fit, Scarpa & Thiene
(2011) also argued that this approach was relatively poor
in giving some insight about the source of heteroge-
neity. McFadden (1986) and Ben-Akiva et al. (2002)
discussed the important role of attitudes and beliefs to
understand and estimate individuals’ preferences, and
to what extent they were conceptually important in
choice decision protocols. However, in spite of the
potential benefit of introducing attitudinal factors to
explain individuals’ preferences heterogeneity, up to
our knowledge, only a few papers have addressed this
issue (Moore, 2008; Stolz et al., 2011a,b). 

The aim of this paper is to assess consumer’s prefe-
rences heterogeneity for extra-virgin olive oil2 in Ca-
talonia (North-East Spain). Spain is the first producer
and exporter country of extra-virgin olive world-wide.
Additionally, olive oil constitutes a fundamental com-
ponent of the Spanish diet. As a consequence, the vast
majority of Spanish consumers are knowledgeable
about this product, and all of them are aware of market
prices and product characteristics. Catalonia is the se-
cond region within Spain in terms of total olive oil con-
sumption (the Catalonian per capita consumption was
9.93 liter in 2011). Moreover, Catalonia has a quite
heterogeneous population with an adequate combina-
tion of urban (Barcelona is the second largest town in
Spain) and rural environments which seems to be ade-
quate for the purpose of this study. 

To tackle with this objective, the methodological
framework adopted is based on the estimation of the
GHR-RPL model. More precisely, we intend to ac-
count for preference heterogeneity in two ways: (i)
by identifying further behavioral information asso-
ciated with the mean of the random parameter dis-
tributions by the parameterization of its heteroge-
neity through attitudinal factors such as health
awareness, environment awareness, organic olive oil
trust, subjective norms, organic olive oil purchasing

1 The use of the Latent class model (LCM) could also lead to inefficient estimates because it might oversimplify the population’s
preferences, especially when a small number of classes are defined and the distribution of preferences is continuous within classes
(Allenby & Rossi, 1998).
2 Extra-virgin indicates that the olive oil has been produced by using mechanical means only, without any chemical treatment and
contains no more than 0.8% free acidity. It is considered as the highest quality olive oil.

intention and knowledge, and (ii) by providing more
information about the variance, allowing it to be
expressed as a function of individual specif ic obser-
ved characteristics. The performance of the GHR-
RPL with attitudinal factors is evaluated against
three alternative RPL models: 1) the conventional
RPL model without accounting for heterogeneity
around the mean (RPL1); 2) the RPL model taking
into account the heterogeneity around the mean of
the random parameters as a function of socio-demo-
graphic characteristics (RPL2); 3) same than RPL2
but in this case heterogeneity is a function of attitu-
dinal factors (RPL3). The paper also illustrates the
implications of each model on the moments of the
WTP distribution. 

Methodology

The extended random parameter logit model
(GHR-RPL)

The choice information used in Random Utility Mo-
deling (RUM) can come from the observations of ac-
tual choices in a real setting (revealed preferences) or
from choices made in hypothetical settings (stated pre-
ferences) (Louviere & Hensher, 1982; Louviere, 2001).
From the latter type of choice information, choice ex-
periments (CE) are derived. The CE is in accordance with
both the Random Utility Theory (RUT) (McFadden,
1974) and the Lancaster’s consumer theory (Lancaster,
1966). The RUT assumes that decision makers are
rational and that individuals make choices to maximize
their utility, taking into account budget constraints. In
parallel, Lancaster’s consumer theory presumes that
the utility of a defined good can be segregated into
product attribute utilities and proposes that consumers
make choices based on attribute preferences. There-
fore, the utility is derived from the attributes and attri-
bute levels. The respondents are asked to make repea-
ted choices between hypothetical alternatives described
by combinations of attributes and their levels and are
asked to choose their preferred alternative.

McFadden (1974) proposed an econometric frame-
work to estimate discrete choice models based on
random utility models. The individual utility of a par-
ticular option can be expressed as follows: 

Uij = Vij + εij [1]

where Vij is a deterministic or observed component that
is a function of alternative product characteristics (Xij)
and εij is the stochastic or non-observed component.
Individual i will choose alternative j if it provides him
a higher utility than any kth available alternative. The
probability of consumer i choosing alternative j out of
the total set of options is expressed as follows: 

[2]

where is the choice set and the observed component
Vij is expressed as follows:

[3]

where β0 is an alternative-specific constant for alterna-
tive j, βk the marginal utility of attribute Xkj and βprice
is the marginal utility of the price Pj of alternative j for
consumer i.

Different assumptions about the stochastic compo-
nent generate different models. If the stochastic com-
ponent εij has a type I extreme value distribution, we
obtain the familiar Multinomial Logit model as a con-
ditional logit model, where the probability of consumer i
choosing option j from a specific choice set (Cn) is ex-
pressed as follows:

[4]

This model is based on the following quite restric-
tive assumptions: 1) the consumers are assumed to be
homogeneous, which implies that all coefficients for
all attributes considered in the utility function are assu-
med to be the same across the sample; 2) the property
of independent of IIA holds; and 3) errors are inde-
pendent over time (Hensher et al., 2005; Van Loo et al.,
2011).

To overcome some of these restrictive assumptions,
several alternatives have been proposed in the litera-
ture. One of the most used in the literature is the RPL
model. The RPL model is based on the assumption that
parameters in Eq. [2] are distributed across individuals
according to a statistical distribution. This model ac-
counts for preference heterogeneity among individuals
and it is flexible enough to accommodate alternative
specifications, although it does not explain the source
of this heterogeneity (Train, 2003). 

Under the RPL model, the probability that an
individual i chooses alternative j in a particular choice
set Cn is expressed as follows:

[5]

where ƒ(βi / θ)is the density function of the βi coeffi-
cients; θ refers to the moments of the parameter distri-
butions (the mean and the standard deviation of βi) and

[6]

As mentioned above, the model is flexible enough to
specify any distribution for the estimated parameters
(such as normal, log-normal, triangular, uniform, etc.).

When the ith individual (i = 1...N) faces a choice
among J alternatives (j = 1...J) in each of the T choice
sets (t = 1...T), the utility of individual i associated
with each alternative in each choice situation can be
expressed as follows (Train, 2003):

[7]

The simplest specification treats the coefficients as
varying among the individuals but being constant for
the choice situation of each person. Under the RPL
model, the individual parameter estimates βij are
expressed as follows: 

[8]

where βj is the sample mean for alternative j, σj is the
standard deviation of the distribution of the partworth
around the mean and ϑij are individual specific hetero-
geneities with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
of one (Hensher & Greene, 2003). The product charac-
teristics (X) are observable, and we can estimate βj and
σj and test (Hensher et al., 2005) which alternative
parametric distribution for βj and σj (e.g., normal, log-
normal, uniform or triangular) provides the best appro-
ximation of sample preferences. 

Greene et al. (2006) suggested extending the RPL
model to capture additional alternative unobserved va-
riation, by first estimating deep parameters to account
for heterogeneity around the mean of the distribution
and, second, adding further behavioral information
associated with the variance of the random parameter
distribution, through the parameterization of its hete-
roscedasticity. Hence, Eq. [8] can be re-written as
follows:

[9]

where the vector Zi is a set of choice-invariant charac-
teristics that produce individual heterogeneity in the
mean of the randomly distributed coefficients; δj are
parameters that capture the mean shift; σij is specified
as σij = σi exp[ωj hri], where ωj are parameters that
capture the variance heterogeneity of the random para-
meters in the systematic utility; and hri are individual
specific characteristics.

The individual choice probabilities can be approxi-
mated using the three-step procedure suggested by
Train (2003): 1) for any given value of θ, draw a value
of βi from ƒ(βi / θ) and label it βir with r = 1...R3;
2) calculate the logit formula Lij(βir) with this draw;
and 3) repeat steps 1) and 2) many times and average
the results. This average is the simulated probability:

[10]

where R is the number of draws. The simulated proba-
bilities are inserted into the log-likelihood function to
obtain a simulated log-likelihood (SLL):

[11]

where dij = 1 if the individual i chooses j and zero other-
wise. The simulated maximum likelihood estimator
(SML) is the value of θ that maximizes SLL. 

The WTP for product attributes is the price change
associated with a unit increase in a given attribute and
can be calculated as the negative ratio of the partial
derivative of the utility function with respect to the
attribute of interest, divided by the derivative of the
utility function with respect to the variable “Price”
(Van Loo et al., 2011):

[12]

The mean and standard deviations of the WTP are
derived by generating a distribution of 1000 WTP esti-
mates using the parametric bootstrapping method pro-
posed by Krinsky & Robb (1986). This approach signi-
ficantly reduces the problem related to potential changes
of sign caused by the extreme values of the behavioral
WTPs distributions. In other words, we are increasing

the probability of prices to be randomly distributed
across the individuals following an unconstrained
distribution. 

To test for differences in WTP distributions derived
from the different estimated RPL models, the nonpara-
metric combinatorial test mentioned in Poe et al.
(2005) will be used. This test consists of calculating
all differences between the WTPs estimated from two
RPL models for all possible combinations of the boot-
strapped values. The proportion differences that are
negative are considered as the p-value associated with
the one side test that the WTP estimated from the first
model overestimate the WTP estimated from the
second model.

Empirical application

Data for this study were collected from a survey
carried out on a random sample among Catalonian con-
sumers of olive oil with quotas by postal code4. A total
of 425 persons participated in face-to-face interviews,
401 of which participated in the choice experiment.
The data collection was conducted in September 2009
during different shopping hours and at different types
of food retail stores. Two filter questions were included
at the beginning of the questionnaire to guarantee that
the sample represented our objective population. The
first one was about if the respondent was responsible
for food shopping within the household. The second
was if the respondent had bought olive oil during the
previous three months. Only respondents who answe-
red yes to the two questions were selected for the
survey. 

The questionnaire used was divided into four sec-
tions. The first section was designed to elicit informa-
tion on respondents’ buying and consumption habits
concerning different types of olive oil. The second
section was designed to obtain information about
different attributes considered by respondents when
buying extra-virgin olive oil, with special attention
paid to attitudes towards the organic attribute. The third
section addressed the choice experiment. The last
section was designed to obtain information about the
socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyles of the

respondents. Attitudes were measured using eleven-
point Likert scales (from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates
total disagreement and 10 indicates total agreement)5.

The choice experiment design

To implement the choice experiment, attributes and
attribute levels were f irst selected on the basis of a
three-step process: 1) a literature review of consumers’
extra-virgin olive oil purchase and consumption habits;
2) two focus groups (of 8 people each) to identify main
consumption patterns and attitudes toward extra-virgin
olive oil, with special focus on the organic attribute;
and 3) observation in retail outlets of real prices and
informal interviews with consumers about their rea-
sons for choosing a specific olive oil. As a result, four
main attributes were identified: price, production sys-
tem, origin of the product, and origin of the brand (see
Table 1). To avoid the level effect between attributes
(De Wilde et al., 2009), each attribute was defined as
having three levels.

Taking into account the number of attribute levels,
a total of 81 (34) hypothetical bottles of extra-virgin
olive oil were obtained. This led to a large number of
choice sets affecting respondents’ decisions and a con-
sequent decrease in response reliability (Chung et al.,

4 In this study, the objective population is assumed to be geographically distributed as the global Catalonian population. To avoid
misrepresentation of the smaller provinces, 40% of the sample is assigned to Barcelona while 20% is assigned to each of the three
remaining provinces. 
5 This scale is very comprehensive for respondents in Spain as it coincides with the traditional grading system at schools.

2010). To reduce the number of combinations that par-
ticipants had to evaluate, an orthogonal factorial design
was generated, resulting in 9 product profiles and 9
choice sets. Each choice set consisted of three alterna-
tives plus the “none of them” option. We employed the
strategy proposed by Street & Burgess (2007) to obtain
a 100% efficient main effects design. Fig. 1 shows one
of the choice sets offered to respondents. 

The empirical models

As mentioned in the introduction, the methodological
approach followed in this paper has been the estimation
of the Greene et al. (2006) GHR-RPL model that ac-
counts for heterogeneity around both the mean and the
variance of the distributions of the estimated parameters.
Results from this model are going to be compared with
three alternative RPL models: RPL1, RPL2 and RPL3,
already mentioned in the introduction. Likelihood ratio
tests will be used to compare the goodness-of-fit per-
formance of alternative models. However, the compari-
son between RPL2 and the GHR-RPL is not straight-
forward as both models are non-nested. The Vuong’s
(1989) test has been used for this purpose.

Suppl. Table S1 [pdf online] shows the description
of the deterministic components of respondents’ utility

that are common for the four models. Except for the
price, which is assumed to be continuous, the rest of
the variables are considered categorical and coded as
either dichotomous of effect-coded dummy variables. 

RPL models allow a higher level of flexibility in
specifying some coefficients to be fixed or randomly
distributed across respondents. In this study, and based
on the Wald test statistic, four parameter estimates
associated to PDO, ORG, CAT, and PRICE are defined
to be random and following unconstrained6 normal
distributions7. In contrast to the approach taken by
Revelt & Train (1998), the price coeff icient is not
assumed to be invariant across individuals. As noted
by Train & Weeks (2005), assuming a f ixed price
coeff icient implies that the standard deviations of
unobserved utility are the same for all observations.
Therefore, estimation practices that ignore this source
of variation may lead to erroneous interpretation and
policy conclusions (Scarpa et al., 2008). 

Suppl Table S1 [pdf online] also includes the main
respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics that
are considered to generate potential sources of
heterogeneity (gender, age, education level, town size,
and olive oil purchasing frequency). Finally, six attitu-
dinal factors related to consumers’ perceptions about
organic olive oil (health awareness, environment awa-
reness, trust, subjective norms, organic olive oil pur-

6 Greene et al. (2006) commented that the impact of accommodating heterogeneity around the mean and variance of random
parameter distributions does not guarantee an advantage to using any constrained distributions.

60% came from elsewhere in the Catalan region. Ap-
proximately 80% of respondents were women, con-
sistent with Gil et al. (2002), as the objective popula-
tion was made up of those responsible for shopping
within households. The average age of the respondents
was 49 years old (with a standard deviation [SD] of
15.39). With respect to the education level, 27.3% of
the respondents had completed only primary studies,
46.8% had completed secondary studies or professio-
nal education, and nearly 25.6% had obtained a univer-
sity degree. Finally, 70% of the respondents were
married, and the average household size was approxi-
mately 3 members. All respondents bought olive oil
regularly. In fact, most of the respondents used to pur-
chase olive oil weekly or every two weeks and nearly
30% purchased it monthly or quarterly. Olive oil and
conventional extra-virgin olive oil are oil types most
commonly bought; only 9.25% of respondents buy
extra-virgin olive oil with a protected denomination of
origin designation and less than 1% buys organic olive
oil. Finally, the mean price paid for one liter of
conventional extra-virgin olive oil was 3.42 euro
(SD = 0.80). 

Empirical results

The four models mentioned above were estimated
by the SML method. Table 3 shows the estimated para-
meters for the four models as well as their relevant
goodness-of-f it measures. As can be observed, the
GHR-RPL model provides the best goodness-of-fit in
terms of the McFadden R-square and the Akaike Infor-

mation Criterion (AIC). Likelihood ratio tests (Ta-
ble 4), partially corroborate such results as the GHR-
RPL outperforms both RPL1 and RPL3 models. When
comparing RPL2 and GHR-RPL, the result from the
Vuong’s test indicates that the difference in goodness-
of-f it measures between these two models is not
statistically signif icant8. Finally, Fig. 2 shows the
estimated marginal utilities from the four RPL models9.
The four utility distributions have very similar shapes.
That is, the introduction of additional sources of hete-
rogeneity, even in the GHR-RPL model, makes both
the mean and the standard deviation to change but not
the global shape of the distribution.

As regards the estimated parameters for the four
RPL models10, in all cases, the no-option coefficient
is negative and significant, indicating that most of the
respondents tried to participate in the choice experi-
ment by choosing one of the proposed olive oil alterna-
tives instead of the no-option alternative. Table 4 also
shows that all parameter estimates associated with the
attribute levels considered in the utility function are
statistically signif icant and with the expected sign,
with the only exception of the estimated parameters
associated to the levels of the attribute Origin of Brand:
“BCAT” (Catalonian Manufacturer Label), which is
not significant in any of the four models, and “PRIV”
(Private Label), which is only significant in RPL3 and
GHR-RPL, where heterogeneity around the mean is
defined as a function of attitudinal factors. 

Table 5 presents the moments of the WTP distri-
butions derived from the four estimated models, as well
as their confidence intervals. Results for the GHR-RPL
model indicate that Catalonian consumers are willing
to pay a 60% premium for a Catalan olive oil over an
olive oil from another Spanish region and a 30% for a
PDO extra virgin olive oil over the conventional coun-
terpart. In contrast, the mean WTP for the organic attri-
bute and imported olive oil are both negative. That is,
consumers reveal that they have to be rewarded to shift
from the conventional to organic olive oil, as well as,
from purchasing olive oil of national origin to imported
olive oil. 

Additionally, results displayed in Table 6 from the
non-parametric combinatorial test reveal that it is not

8 In any case, this result has to be interpreted with caution as the Vuong’s test has low power in finite samples (Desmarais & Harden,
2013).
9 A kernel density function has been used to graph the non-parametrically distribution of the marginal utility of the respondents in
both models.

possible to reject at the 5% level of significance that
the estimated WTPs obtained from the four models are
statistically similar for all attribute levels except for
the organic attribute level in the RPL2. The WTP value
for such attribute is also negative but lower than in the
other three models. This result indicates that when
heterogeneity around the mean and the variance is
explicitly considered, although the goodness-of-fit of
estimated models improve, no significant differences
are found in relation to WTP measures. This could be
used as an argument in favor of the use of using simpler
models especially when the main reason for using the
CE is to assess consumers’ WTP.

Discussion

As mentioned above, accounting for mean and va-
riance heterogeneity of random parameters estimates

has been proved to be relevant as the GHR-RPL model
clearly outperforms the other models being significant
a large number of specific parameters associated with
mean and variance heterogeneity. Therefore, in the next
paragraphs we concentrate in discussing results obtai-
ned from such model. 

Results from Table 3 suggest that the organic pro-
duction system does not seem to influence consumer
preferences. The negative utility of organic olive oil is
noticeable. This result can be explained by the fact that
in Spain, olive oil is already perceived as a healthy pro-
duct by Spanish consumers, as it occupies a promi-
nent position in the Mediterranean diet. In line with
Calatrava (2002), the organic attribute does not add
any additional value to Spanish consumers, especially
when Spanish consumers are not sufficiently concer-
ned about environmental issues. In fact, environmental
concerns do not seem to be a key factor in explaining
consumer’s olive oil choices (Vega-Zamora et al.,

2011). This finding contradicts results reported in other
studies such as: Gracia & Magistris (2008), for Italy;
Soler et al. (2002) and Vega-Zamora et al. (2013), for
Spain; or Tsakiridou et al. (2006), for Greece. Howe-
ver, in all mentioned studies, consumers only had to
choose between organic olive oil and its conventional
counterpart, whereas in our study, we have considered
the trade-offs not only with other olive oil attributes
but with other attribute levels within the production
system, such as the PDO (Protected Designation of
Origin). 

In line with Gracia & Magistris (2007), consumer’s
preferences in Catalonia towards the organic olive oil
are positively affected by their more positive attitude
towards environmental benefits provided by the orga-
nic production system. Equally important is the effect
of subjective norms associated with the consumption
of organic olive oil in mitigating the disutility related
to its consumption (Chen, 2007). An interesting result
that arises from this study is that consumer’s attitudes
towards health benefits provided by organic olive oil
(HL) and trust (TRT) do not seem to have a significant
effect on consumers’ marginal utilities towards the or-
ganic olive oil. This may be related to the consumer’s
positive perception about the healthiness of the extra
virgin olive oil regardless the type of production sys-
tem (PDO, organic, or conventional) (Calatrava, 2002;
Vega-Zamora et al., 2011). In any case, results also
suggest that more information on the properties of the
organic olive oil could be relevant to increase the con-
sumers knowledge about this product and then to in-
crease the probability to buy it (the coefficient of the
interaction ORG-KNW is positive and significant), in
line with the results found in of Gracia & Magistris
(2008). Moreover, the negative and significant coeffi-
cient of the interaction ORG-AGE to explain variance
heterogeneity suggests this information should be
mainly address to younger consumers. 

Contrary to the organic attribute, Catalonian consu-
mers show a strong preference for PDO extra virgin

olive oil. Scarpa & Del Guidice (2004) arrived to the
same conclusion in Italy. This result is consistent with
prior expectations as results from the survey indicated
that 9.26% of Catalonian consumers use to buy PDO
extra virgin olive oil while less than 1% buy occasiona-
lly organic olive oil. PDO extra virgin olive oil is very
knowledgeable among Catalonian and Spanish consu-
mers. There exist 28 PDO brands in Spain; five of them
are located in Catalonia. Additionally, the production
of this type of olive oil continues to grow being the
domestic market its main destination and, to a lesser
extent, the EU (Ruiz-Castillo, 2008). In any case, such
positive preference is not homogeneous among Catalo-
nian consumers. PDO olive oil is highly preferred by
the older population with higher education levels and
showing a higher purchasing frequency of olive oil.
Results from Table 3 also show that the interaction
terms PDO-ENV, PDO-KNW, and PDO-SBN are
negative and statistically significant. Therefore, the
results reveal that consumer’s preferences in Catalonia
towards PDO olive oil are negatively correlated with
factors affecting attitudes towards organic olive oil
such as subjective norms, consumers’ concerns about
the environmental benef its of organic olive oil and
knowledge. 

The price coefficient (–0.987) is significant and has
a negative sign, becoming the most restrictive factor
for purchasing extra virgin olive oil (Scarpa & Del
Giudice, 2004; Parras-Rosa et al., 2008; Menapace
et al., 2011). Moreover, the corresponding standard
deviation is significant indicating relevant Catalonian
consumers’ preferences heterogeneity. However, this
negative utility is mitigated, to a certain extent, in con-
sumers who are more likely to purchase organic olive
oil (i.e. the interaction term PRICE-PINT is statisti-
cally significant and positive). Furthermore, the statis-
tically significance of the variance heterogeneity coef-
ficients show that price heterogeneity within the model
varies taking into account the effect of some socio-
demographic factors such as the university education

level (UNIV), age (AGE) and town size (TS). However,
while the effect of two first variables is positive that
of the last one is negative, indicating that older, more
educated consumers and those living in rural areas are
less sensitive with respect to price.

Apart from price, the origin is one of the most im-
portant attributes affecting consumers’ preferences to-
ward extra-virgin olive oil. In fact, the estimated para-
meters associated to the origin levels (IMP and CAT)
(–0.621 and 0.581, respectively) are relatively high,
only below those associated to PRICE and ORG
(–0.781). This finding is consistent with previous stu-
dies on the importance of geographical origin in consu-
mer decision making (Scarpa & Del Guidice, 2004;
Scarpa & Thiene, 2005; Schnettler et al., 2008; Mena-
pace et al., 2011). Catalan olive oils are preferred over
other Spanish or imported oils, while olive oil produ-
ced in other Spanish regions is preferred over imported
olive oil. The positive preference associated with the
Catalan olive oil increases for consumers who are more
likely to buy organic olive oil. This result was also
found by Cicia et al. (2002) who evaluated the prefe-
rences of regular consumers of organic food towards
the purchasing intention of extra virgin olive oil. They
concluded that regular organic food consumers pay
more attention to the origin of the product which is ta-
ken as a proxy of organic olive oil quality. Further-
more, and consistent with the results we discussed abo-
ve about marginal utilities associated to PDO olive oil,
older consumers with higher education level have a
stronger preference for the local origin as well as for
respondents who buy extra-virgin olive oil less fre-
quently. In fact, results from the survey indicated that
this consumer segment used to buy olive oil in large
quantities from local cooperatives. 

The lack of significance associated with the local
brand attribute level (BCAT) indicates that in the case
of extra-virgin olive oil, respondents are more interes-
ted in the origin of the product than in the origin of the
brand, although this result could be related to the fact
that many consumers do not acknowledge the origin
of the brand (that is, whether the manufacturer is loca-
ted or not in Catalonia). Results also show that, on ave-
rage, consumers do not value private labels for this
specific product. 

Finally, it is worth mentioning that this study has
been based on the use of generic alternatives and hypo-
thetical responses to choice experiment questions. Lusk
& Schroeder (2004) showed that hypothetical choices
could overestimate the marginal willingness to pay for

extra-virgin olive oil. Therefore, results from this study
could be extended to non-hypothetical environments in
which consumers face choices involving real products
and real money in a series of choice scenarios.
