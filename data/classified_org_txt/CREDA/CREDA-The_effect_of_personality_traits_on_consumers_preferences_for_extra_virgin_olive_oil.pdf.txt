The effect of personality traits on consumers’ preferences for extra virgin olive oil 23 

 24 

1. Introduction  25 

Olive oil is a food product consumed in most Mediterranean countries and is an 26 

essential component of the Mediterranean diet (Garcia-Closas et al., 2006). Its 27 

importance in the daily lives of consumers reflects its ancient traditions, its social and 28 

agro-environmental dimensions, as well as its health and nutritional benefits. The 29 

European Union produces 73 percent of the world’s olive oil and consumes about 66 30 

per cent  (International Olive Oil Council, 2013). As Figure 1 shows, the main olive oil 31 

producers and consumers are Spain and Italy. However, an important expansion of olive 32 

oil consumption may be observed outside the traditional Mediterranean countries 33 

(United States International Trade Commission, 2013). The Mintel Global New 34 

Products Database (GNPD) database reveals that 1,116 new olive oils were launched 35 

from 2011 to 2013 all around the world. Of these, stores in the USA stocked about 15 36 

percent, followed by Brazilian stores with about 13 percent (see Table 1).   37 

Olive oil characteristics are regulated within the EU by Regulation (EEC) N° 38 

2568/91, which establishes a list of physical, chemical, and organoleptic characteristics, 39 

as well as methods for their measurement. However, continuous research and 40 

development (R&D) in this sector has produced a large variety of olive oil types and 41 

specifications, making consumers more dependent on displayed information to make 42 

their purchasing decisions. Olive oil quality attributes are mainly communicated on the 43 

product label, which builds pre-consumption confidence among consumers (Scarpa and 44 

Del Giudice, 2004). Olive oil labels typically fall within the category of “credence 45 

attributes,” including organic production certifications and protected denomination of 46 

origin (PDO), which consumers cannot directly value through  consumption of the oil 47 

(Nocella et al., 2012).  48 

Understanding oil consumption requires accounting for new olive oil varieties and 49 

trademarks developed worldwide and for the increasing public awareness of the health 50 

and environmental benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet and PDO products. 51 

However, different consumers may focus on different information cues, and therefore 52 

may develop specific behavioral criteria when making purchasing decisions (Menapace 53 



4 

 

et al., 2011; Philippidis et al., 2002). Hence, better understanding of how consumers 54 
evaluate olive oil is essential to help producers succeed in an increasingly competitive 55 

market.  56 

More understanding of how consumers construct their evaluations and their 57 

consequent purchasing decisions with respect to marketed olive oils is also important to 58 

EU policy makers and regulators.  It is extremely likely that olive oil consumption will 59 

increase at world level. The current orientation of EU olive oil policy, as stated in the 60 

European Commission web page,1 is “to maintain and strengthen its position in world 61 

markets by encouraging production of a high quality product for the benefit of growers, 62 

processors, traders and consumers.” However, this is not an easy task, as an individual’s 63 

preferences depend not only on the extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of the products to be 64 

purchased but also on factors unrelated to food (Chen, 2007; Nocella et al., 2012). 65 

This paper aims to identify the effect of consumers’ specific characteristics, 66 

namely the role of food-related personality traits, lifestyle orientations, and purchase 67 

habits in shaping their purchase intentions regarding olive oil. To achieve this objective, 68 

data from a survey carried out from a representative sample of Catalonian (north-eastern 69 

Spain) consumers have been employed. The methodological framework is based on a 70 

discrete-choice modeling approach, named the hybrid choice model (HCM). This model 71 

specifically accounts for preference heterogeneity in examining the effects of individual 72 

personality traits, lifestyles, and habits. 73 

Traditionally, the HCM model has involved two steps.2 In the first step, latent 74 

variables (i.e., food-related personality traits, lifestyles or purchase habits, among 75 

others) are derived from observed indicators via a “multiple-indicator, multiple cause” 76 

model (MIMIC), used to relate latent individual traits to observable determinants. In the 77 

second step, the predicted latent variables are incorporated into the discrete-choice 78 

model as explanatory variables to estimate a multinomial logit model. 79

2 Alternatively, the HCM can be seen as resulting in both efficient and consistent estimates (Ben-Akiva et 
al., 2002; Kløjgaard and Hess, 2011; Rungie et al., 2012). However, this approach usually results in 
convergence and identification problems, as the number of latent variables increases (Ashok et al., 2002). 
In this study, due to the high number of latent variables introduced, the sequential estimation method of 
the HCM based on the mixed logit model is used.

Our paper extends the existing literature in at least two ways. First, it does not 80 

merely estimate latent variables from observed indicators, but also estimates the 81 

hierarchical relationships between latent variables using a structural equation model 82 

(SEM), providing better insight into the consumers’ cognitive decision-making 83 

processes. Second, this study employs an HCM in a panel-data context constructed from 84 

the repeated-choice data set while considering sample heterogeneity. It estimates a 85 

random parameter logit (RPL) model, considering the latent variables as random 86 

parameters (Yáñez et al., 2010) and solving the HCM problem of integrating the 87 

variation of the latent variables within the basic framework of multinomial choice 88 

models (Ashok et al., 2002).  89 

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the methodological 90 

framework used—the HCM. The design of the empirical application is shown in 91 

Section 3. Specifically, we will concentrate on how the SEM model has been specified 92 

and how the choice experiment has been designed. The main results are outlined in 93 

Section 4. The final section contains some concluding remarks. 94 

 95 

2. Methodological framework: the HCM 96 

The discrete-choice model approach has received a significant amount of attention 97 

in recent literature (Campbell et al., 2010; Greene and Hensher, 2013). Moreover, 98 

evidence of preference heterogeneity in both revealed and stated preference data is 99 

increasing. Failure to account for preference heterogeneity may result in poor model 100 

performance, which could lead to reliability problems in the model results (Hynes et al., 101 

2008). Different methodological approaches have been suggested in the literature: 1) the 102 

use of latent class models (McFadden, 1986; Boxall and Adamowicz, 2002); 2) the 103 

inclusion of interaction effects to explain sources of heterogeneity (Montgomery, 2001); 104 

3) the use of random parameter estimates, assuming preference coefficients to be 105 

randomly distributed across individuals (Revelt and Train, 1998; Walker and Ben-106 

Akiva, 2002); and 4) the combination of interaction effects and random parameters 107 

(Hensher and Greene, 2003) or latent class and random parameters (Bujosa el al., 2010; 108 

Greene and Hensher, 2013).In all cases, individuals' utilities and the heterogeneity of 109 

their preferences are assumed to be a function of the observed variables. However, these 110 



6 

 

observable product attributes and covariates can only explain part of the utility, and fail 111 

to capture the true inner process of a decision maker. 112 

Ben-Akiva et al. (2002) extended the traditional discrete-choice model by 113 

introducing the HCM. The HCM model defines an individual’s utility as a function of 114 
observed explanatory variables, such as product attributes and respondents’ socio-115 

economic characteristics, while including latent variables that can reflect consumers’ 116 

psychological factors, personality traits, or attitudes. Previous empirical applications of 117 

the HCM have been mainly in the field of transport economics (Bolduc et al., 2008; 118 

Yáñez et al., 2010), and recently in sociology (Rungie et al., 2011, 2012) and health 119 

economics (Kløjgaard and Hess, 2011). They have shown that: 1) the inclusion of latent 120 

variables significantly improves the goodness-of-fit of the model; and 2) psychological 121 

factors better contribute to capturing a consumer’s preference heterogeneity. One of the 122 

main contributions of this study is that it constitutes one of the first attempts to apply 123 

the HCM approach to food marketing.  124 

The application of the HCM implies the design of a choice experiment, which is 125 

based on both random utility theory (RUT) (McFadden, 1974) and Lancaster consumer 126 

theory (Lancaster, 1966). The RUT assumes that the utility provided by alternative j 127 

(j=1,...,J) from choice set s (s=1,....,S) to individual i  (i=1,…N) is given by the 128 

following:  129 

𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  (1) 130 

where Vijs is a deterministic component and εijs is the stochastic or non-observed 131 

component. In a traditional model, the deterministic component, Vijs, can be represented 132 

as a function of alternative attributes as follows: 133 

𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (2) 134 

where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the vector of attributes related to alternative j; 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the vector of 135 

marginal utilities of the individual i related to the k attributes in alternative j from the 136 

choice set s. 137 

In the HCM, latent variables are incorporated in the deterministic component of an 138 

individual’s utility 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 as follows: 139 

𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  (3) 140 



7 

 

where 𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the vector of endogenous latent characteristics (l=1,....L), 𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the 141 

corresponding vector of exogenous latent characteristics (q=1,…,Q); and 𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝛽𝛽𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 142 

are the vectors of the marginal effects of 𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 on the utility function of the i-th 143 

individual when choosing alternative j from the choice set s. 144 

However, these latent variables are immaterial constructs that cannot be directly 145 

observed: the usual approaches to identifying them rely on MIMIC or SEM models. 146 

Both require additional information about these latent variables (i.e. personality traits, 147 

purchase habits, or lifestyles). The MIMIC model considers only a group of latent 148 

variables that are explained by a set of observable determinants. The SEM also takes 149 

into account the structural relationships that can exist among latent variables.  150 

The SEM consists of two sets of equations. The first, a set of measurement 151 

equations, describes the relationship between latent (exogenous 𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 152 

endogenous  𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )
3  and observed variables (𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  and  𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), after performing a 153 

confirmatory factor analysis (Equations 4 and 5) (Jöreskov and Sörbomm, 1996). The 154 

second, a set of structural equations, describes the relationship between endogenous and 155 

exogenous latent variables, and permits the evaluation of the causal effects among these 156 

variables (Equation 6) (Jöreskov and Sörbomm, 1996). 157 

𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛬𝛬𝑚𝑚𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  (4) 158 

𝑤𝑤𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛬𝛬𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛤𝛤𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (5) 159 

𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜁𝜁𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (6) 160 

where the indices m, p, l, q, i, j, and s refer to indicators that describe exogenous latent 161 

variables, indicators that describe endogenous latent variables, endogenous latent 162 

variables, exogenous latent variables, respondents, alternatives, and choice sets, 163 

respectively. 𝛬𝛬𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛬𝛬𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  , 𝛼𝛼𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and 𝜃𝜃𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖are the parameters to be jointly estimated. 164 

𝛿𝛿𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝛤𝛤𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, and 𝜁𝜁𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  represent the error terms that are typically considered normally 165 

distributed with mean zero and standard deviation to be estimated, and assumed to be 166 

                                                           

3 The term “exogenous latent variable” means that it is not dependent on any other variable in the 
model.  Usually one or more variables in the model are dependent on this variable. Endogenous latent 
variables refer to latent variables that are dependent on one or more variables in the model.  Note that an 
endogenous variable may be dependent on another endogenous variable.

uncorrelated with  𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and both 𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , in Equations 4, 5, and 6, 167 

respectively. The Full SEM model is estimated with Robust Maximum Likelihood 168 

(RML), due to a potential lack of normality.  169 

Now, the probability of consumer i choosing the alternative j from the choice set s, 170 

assuming that the stochastic component 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 follows the type I Extreme Value 171 

distribution, is defined as follows:  172 

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =
𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝�𝜇𝜇𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�

∑ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝(𝜇𝜇𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)
𝐽𝐽
𝑖𝑖=1

   (7) 173 

The sequential estimation method of the HCM requires integrating over the 174 

variation of latent variables within the basic framework of multinomial choice models 175 

(Ashok et al., 2002). Yañez et al. (2010) showed that this integration could be attained 176 

by estimating an RPL model that considers the latent variables as random parameters.  177 

Under the RPL model, the probability that individual “i” chooses alternative “j” 178 

from a particular choice set s is given by the following: 179 

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∫ 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝑓𝑓(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖|𝜃𝜃)𝑑𝑑𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖  (8) 180 

where 𝑓𝑓(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖|𝜃𝜃) is the density function of the 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 coefficients, and 𝜃𝜃 refers to the moments 181 

of the parameter distributions, which can take any specified form, such as normal, 182 

lognormal, triangular, uniform, etc. Moreover, 183 

𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖� =
𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝 �𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖��

∑ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝 �𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝜂𝜂𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝜉𝜉𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖��
𝐽𝐽
𝑖𝑖=1

  (9) 184 

The parameter estimates 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , are defined to capture additional non-observed 185 

variations and to better explain preference heterogeneity between individuals, as follows 186 

(Hensher et al., 2005): 187 

𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜗𝜗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  (10) 188 

where 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the sample-mean for the alternative j from the choice set s; 𝜗𝜗𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  is the 189 

individual specific heterogeneity, with mean zero and standard deviation equal to 1 190 

(Hensher and Greene, 2003); and 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖  is a set of choice invariant characteristics that 191 

produce individual heterogeneity in the means of the randomly distributed coefficients, 192 

such as individual specific characteristics. 193 



9 

 

Because the resulting model is specified to include both fixed and random 194 

coefficients, the simulated maximum likelihood (SML) technique provides a faster and 195 

easier way to estimate the individual choice probabilities (Ben-Akiva et al., 2002). 196 

According to Train (2003), the simulation proceeds in three steps for any given value of 197 

𝜃𝜃. First, a value of 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is drawn from 𝑓𝑓(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖|𝜃𝜃) (𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖
𝑟𝑟 with r = 1… R4). Second, the logit 198 

𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖
𝑟𝑟), is calculated from this draw. Finally, Steps 1 and 2 are repeated, and the 199 

obtained results are averaged. This average is the simulated probability: 200 

𝑃𝑃𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝑖𝑖� =
1
𝑅𝑅
∑ 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖

𝑟𝑟)𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟=1   (11) 201 

where R is the number of draws. The simulated probabilities are inserted into the log-202 

likelihood function to give a simulated log-likelihood (SLL): 203 

𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = ∑ ∑ 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝐽𝐽
𝑖𝑖=1

𝐼𝐼
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑃𝑃𝚤𝚤𝚤𝚤𝑖𝑖�  (12) 204 

where 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 if i chooses j from the choice set s and 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=0 otherwise. The maximum 205 

simulated likelihood estimator, (MSLE), is the value of 𝜃𝜃 that maximizes SLL. 206 

 207 

3. The experiment design  208 
3.1. The survey  209 

The data used in this study were obtained from a survey carried out on a 210 

representative sample of the Catalonian (north-east Spain) population with quotas by 211 

postal code. The survey was addressed to those responsible for shopping within the 212 

household. The Spanish market was selected because Spain is top-ranked together with 213 

Italy among those countries producing and exporting olive oil, in terms of both quantity 214 

and value (International Olive Oil Council, 2013). Additionally, olive oil constitutes a 215 

fundamental component of the Spanish diet. 216 

As a consequence, many Spanish consumers are knowledgeable about this product, 217 

and most of them are aware of market prices and product characteristics. In Spain, the 218 

market value for organic olive oil was 5.4 million Euros in 2012 (MAGRAMA, 2013). 219 

                                                           

4Halton draws were used because they have been shown to provide more efficient distributions for 
numerical integration compared to random draws (Bhat, 2003). 



10 

 

Catalonia is second among Spanish regions in terms of total olive oil consumption, 220 

with a per capita consumption of 9.93 liters in 2011. It also occupies the second position 221 

in relation to the consumption of organic olive oil (13 percent of the Spanish total 222 

consumption in value) after Madrid. The population in Catalonia is quite heterogeneous, 223 

with a combination of urban (Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain) and rural 224 

environments.  225 

Information was gathered from 401 persons. Participants were recruited using two 226 

filters: 1) they had to have bought extra-virgin olive oil in the last three months; and 2) 227 

they were responsible for shopping within the household. Face-to-face interviews were 228 

conducted in September 2009 at different shopping hours and different types of food 229 

retail stores. The questionnaire consisted of four major blocks. The first block was 230 

designed to elicit information on respondents’ purchasing and consumption habits with 231 

regard to different types of olive oil. The second and third blocks were reserved to 232 

obtain the latent variables and to collect information about socio-demographic 233 

characteristics and consumers’ personality traits and lifestyles. All indicators were 234 

measured using eleven-point Likert scales (from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates total 235 

disagreement and 10 is total agreement).5 The last block included the choice experiment 236 

task. 237 

 238 

3.2. A conceptual model for organic olive oil purchasing intention  239 

The first step in the HCM consists of defining the latent variables that will be 240 

introduced later in the discrete-choice model. In this paper, latent variables have been 241 

measured through a set of observable indicators, and the hierarchical relationships 242 

between the latent variables have been estimated using an SEM. In this section, the 243 

conceptual model on which the SEM is based is presented. Based on previous literature, 244 

we will define the main latent variables used for the purpose of this paper as well as the 245 

expected relationships between them.  246 

                                                           

5 Respondents can easily understand this scale, as the grading system at Spanish schools is based on a 
similar system.  



11 

 

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of attitudes and perceptions in 247 

understanding the decision-making process during purchase (Ajzen, 2005; Ben-Akiva et 248 

al., 2002; Eertmans et al., 2005; Johansson et al., 2006; Scarpa and Thiene, 2011). 249 

Several studies have found that a relationship exists between an individual’s personality 250 

traits, psychological characteristics, or attitudes to nutrition (Chen, 2007; Nocella et al., 251 

2012). 252 

In view of these results, the conceptual model we use draws on the Theory of 253 

Planned Behavior (TPB) (Jöreskov and Sörbomm, 1996) to define the behavioral latent 254 

variables to be introduced in the discrete-choice model (Ashok et al., 2002). As Ajzen 255 

(1991) has stated, the TPB was designed to predict and explain human behavior in 256 

specific contexts based on the relation between intention and behavior, so that intentions 257 

to perform a behavior (such as purchasing olive oil) are assumed to capture the 258 

motivational factors that influence such behavior. The TPB considers that human 259 

intentions to perform a behavior are guided by three types of consideration: 1) the 260 

“attitude” toward the behavior, or to what extent a person evaluates, either positively or 261 

negatively, the behavior in question; in the case of organic food, a positive attitude 262 

toward organic food is believed to be positively related to the intention to purchase 263 

organic food (Chen, 2007); 2) “subjective norms” or perceived social pressure, such as 264 

from family, friends, etc. to perform or not to perform the behavior (Ajzen, 1991, Al-265 

Swidi et al. 2014); and 3) beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or 266 

impede the performance of the behavior. The power of these control beliefs determines 267 

the “Perceived Behavioral Control” or perceived ease or difficulty of performing the 268 

behavior. In the framework of organic food, perceived control would include the effects 269 

of both external (such as time spent, availability, recognition by labeling, confidence, 270 

etc.) and internal variables (such as skills, knowledge, abilities, habits, etc.) that 271 

consumers believe can influence their judgment of risks and benefits associated with 272 

these products (Ajzen, 2005; Chen, 2007). 273 

In the specific case of purchasing organic olive oil we can test the hypothesis that 274 

attitudes toward organic olive oil, subjective norms regarding olive oil, and the 275 

Perceived Behavioral Control in purchasing olive oil lead to the formation of a final 276 

behavioral intention to purchase. Figure 2 shows the conceptual model used in this 277 

study. Our model extends the TPB in two ways: identifying which personality traits 278 



12 

 

have an effect on shaping individuals’ attitudes toward the behavior; and testing if 279 

extrinsic product features, such as available information, quality evaluation, and price 280 

can have an effect on facilitating the perception of control toward the behavior.  281 

Chen (2007) showed that food-related personality traits, defined as food 282 

involvement or the level of importance that food has in a person’s life (and 283 

operationalized as the extent to which people enjoy talking about food, entertain 284 

thoughts about food during the day, and engage in food-related activities: Goody, 1982), 285 

exert a positive effect on a consumer’s attitude toward organic food. Bell and Marshall 286 

(2003) argued that the level of food involvement was a significant discriminating factor 287 

between food items in sensory evaluations. Eertmans et al. (2005) argued that both food 288 

intake and following a healthy diet appeared to vary with level of food involvement. 289 

Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  290 

Hypothesis 1a. Consumers who show a higher level of food involvement are 291 

expected to have a more positive attitude toward organic olive oil than consumers who 292 

give less importance to food. 293 

Food-related personality traits link people to food-related activities, such as food 294 

procurement, preparation, cooking, etc. (Goody, 1982). The recent literature shows that 295 

cooking skills play a significant role in dietary changes to promote healthy eating (Van 296 

den Horsk et al., 2010). Due to the importance of olive oil in the Mediterranean diet, 297 

cooking skills are hypothesized to affect the attitude toward organic olive oil positively. 298 

Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:  299 

Hypothesis 1b. Consumers with better cooking skills are expected to have a more 300 

positive attitude toward organic olive oil than consumers with fewer cooking skills.  301 

Another factor that has been emphasized as an important psychological variable in 302 

describing consumer food choice is lifestyle. Different lifestyles sort individuals into 303 

groups on the basis of the things they like to do, how they like to spend their leisure 304 

time, and how they choose to spend their disposable income (Moore, 1963; Krishnan, 305 

2011). Lifestyle describes how people seek to express their identity in many areas, such 306 

as activities, interests, and opinions (Wells and Tigert, 1971). In a consumption 307 

environment, a person chooses a product or brand that seems to match with his/her life 308 

style/identity (Krishnan, 2011). An individual’s lifestyle is reflected in his/her 309 



13 

 

personality and self-concepts, which are determined by his/her interests, opinions, 310 

activities, etc.  311 

Moreover, attitudes, behavioral tendencies, and habits are derived from differences 312 

in lifestyles across consumers (Chen, 2009). Shaharudin et al. (2010) showed that 313 

consumers’ lifestyles were related to their attitude toward the purchasing of organic 314 

food. Krishnan (2011) confirmed that consumers’ lifestyles were strongly related to 315 

their purchased brands. Our model aims to identify two types of consumer lifestyle: 316 

healthy lifestyle and orderly lifestyle. The former emphasizes physical health-related 317 

activities, such as natural food consumption, health care, etc. (Gil et al., 2000). 318 

Eertmans et al (2005) argue that a healthy lifestyle should be advocated to render the 319 

consumer’s attitude toward organic foods more positive. The orderly and methodical 320 

lifestyle can be expressed through activities such as disposing garbage in different 321 

containers, reducing stress, keeping equilibrium between working and personal life, et 322 

cetera. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 323 

Hypothesis 1c: Consumers with orderly lifestyles can more easily follow 324 

environmentally friendly behaviors and therefore have a more positive attitude toward 325 

organic food than consumers who have less orderly lifestyles. 326 

Over the last decade, food scares (BSE, dioxins, foot-and-mouth disease, etc.) have 327 

reshaped consumer behavior to a certain extent. Consumers are now more concerned 328 

about food safety issues (Chen, 2007). Moreover, according to Chen (2009), a healthy 329 

consumption lifestyle, attitudes toward organic food, and the intention to purchase 330 

organic food appear to correlate significantly. Therefore, the following hypothesis is 331 

proposed: 332 

Hypothesis 1d. The healthier the consumers’ lifestyle, the more positive their 333 

attitudes toward organic foods will be.  334 

As stated before, extrinsic product features, such as available information, and 335 

purchasing habits such as quality and price valuation, can have an effect on facilitating 336 

the perception of control toward behavior. Indeed, Ajzen (2005) stated that the more 337 

resources and opportunities individuals believe they possess, and the fewer obstacles or 338 

impediments they anticipate, the greater should be their perceived control over the 339 

behavior. Therefore, the following hypothesis can be proposed: 340 



14 

 

Hypothesis 2a. With more information that consumers have regarding a product, 341 

such as its certification (labels), the greater should be the control they perceive to have 342 

regarding the specific acquisition.  343 

Repetitive purchasing habits can simplify behavior, as many decisions become 344 

routine and can be adopted with minimal conscious control. In other words, individuals 345 

tend to persist in doing what they have are accustomed to doing. In this study, we have 346 

assessed the effect of “purchasing habits” by considering two latent variables, “Price 347 

Involvement” and “Quality Involvement,” which have been considered by other authors 348 

to be relevant in explaining consumer buying behavior (Mann et al., 2012; Menapace et 349 

al., 2011). The first variable involves the relevance of price and price promotions in a 350 

specific purchasing decision. As shown by Avitia et al. (2015) the price has a highly 351 

relevant role in defining consumers’ willingness to purchase sustainable food, and it can 352 

be considered as a limit for current consumption of sustainable food. Their work 353 

indicated that consumers value sustainable attributes and are willing to pay a premium 354 

for them, but this premium is still lower than the market price for such products. The 355 

same can be said in relation to quality standards. Therefore, the following hypotheses 356 

can be proposed: 357 

Hypothesis 2b. As consumers become less sensitive to price and price promotions, 358 

their perceived behavioral control increases. 359 

Hypothesis 2c. As food quality plays a more important role in consumers’ food 360 

habits, their perceived behavioral control increases. 361 

 362 

3.3. The choice experiment 363 

Four attributes (price, production system, the origin of the product, and the origin 364 

of the brand) with three levels each were used in the experiment design (Table 2). The 365 

attribute and attribute levels were selected based on a three-step qualitative study: 1) a 366 

literature review of consumer behavior relating to organic and/or extra virgin olive oil; 367 

2) four focus groups of eight people each were conducted to identify the main 368 

consumption patterns and attitudes toward extra virgin olive oil, with special attention 369 

to the organic attribute; and 3) observation in retail outlets to identify real prices and 370 



15 

 

informal interviews in the same retail outlets about reasons for choosing a specific 371 

product.  372 

Considering the number of attributes and their levels in Table 2, a full factorial 373 

design of 81 (3*3*3*3 = 34) combinations was generated. Presenting respondents with 374 

one-liter bottles of olive oil with 81 combinations of attributes, however, could place a 375 

high level of cognitive burden on respondents. To reduce the number of combinations 376 

that participants had to evaluate, we followed Street and Burgess (2007) and generated 377 

an orthogonal fractional factorial design of nine combinations. These nine combinations 378 

were considered as the first option in each choice set. Since participants were provided 379 

with choice sets of three options each (plus a no-choice option), the other two options 380 

were obtained using the following generators (1212) and (2121) (Street and Burgess, 381 

2007). This resulted in a 100 percent efficient main-effects design. 382 

 383 

4. Results and discussion 384 
4.1. Sample characteristics  385 

As mentioned above, a total of 401 respondents completed the survey. About 80 386 

percent were women, consistent with statistics reported by the Spanish ministry about 387 

shopping responsibility within the household (MAGRAMA, 2008). Approximately 70 388 

percent of the respondents were married, and their average age was 49 years (with a 389 

standard deviation of 15.39). The average household size was three. Furthermore, 35 390 

percent were households with one or more members younger than 18 years old, and 391 

only 14 percent had children under six years old. Regarding education level, 27.3 392 

percent of respondents had only completed primary school, while 46.8 percent had 393 

completed secondary studies or professional education. Finally, regarding the 394 

geographic distribution of the sample, 40 percent came from Barcelona (the Catalonian 395 

capital), while 60 percent came from the rest of the Catalonian region.  396 

Consistent with Jiménez-Guerrero et al. (2012), results from the survey suggest 397 

that most respondents usually purchase extra virgin olive oil, but only 9.25 percent of 398 

the respondents search for PDO extra virgin olive oil. Olive oil is normally purchased 399 

weekly or every two weeks, although a significant percentage of respondents (nearly 30 400 

percent) purchase it monthly or quarterly (in many cases directly from a 401 



16 

 

farmer/producer or a cooperative). The consumption of organic olive oil is marginal 402 

(less than 0.6 percent of respondents buy it regularly). Respondent’s reasons for not 403 

buying organic olive oil included the high price, the lack of availability in the 404 

supermarket where they buy food, or lack of information about organic food. 405 

4.2. The SEM: Consumer’s purchasing intentions 406 

Following the traditional procedure for estimating the SEM (Kline, 2005), a 407 

confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was first carried out for the entire set of constructs. 408 

Six “personality latent variables” (orderly life style, healthy life style, price 409 

involvement, food quality involvement, food involvement, and cooking skills) and five 410 

“behavioral latent factors” (attitude, behavioral control perception, purchase intention, 411 

knowledge, and subjective norms) were obtained (Tables A1 and A2, in the Annex). 412 

Standardized factor loading estimates were all significant and above the recommended 413 

value of 0.7 (Hair et al., 1999). The main parameters to test the robustness of the 414 

construct, following Kline (2005), appear to show good results for almost all constructs. 415 

The internal consistency of reliability of each construct reached an acceptable Cronbach 416 

alpha of over 0.7, and the composite reliabilities were greater than 0.7, except for the 417 

factor “Healthy Life Style”, which was 0.6. Nevertheless, we chose to retain this factor 418 

in our model. 419 

The SEM was estimated in the second step. Table 3 summarizes the estimation 420 

results and the main goodness-of-fit measures. The model meets the accepted goodness-421 

of-fit criteria according to Hair et al. (1999) and Kline (2005): 1) the normed Chi-422 

squared (NC) is less than 3; 2) the value for the root mean square error of 423 

approximation (RMSEA) is 0.065 (less than 0.8); 3) regarding the incremental fit-index, 424 

the comparative-fit-index (CFI) is 0.952, which exceeds the value guidelines in the 425 

literature (0.90); 4) the normed-fit-index (NFI), non-normed-fit-index (NNFI) and 426 

relative fit-index (RFI) are all above 0.9, indicating that the conceptual model 427 

adequately fits the data; and 5) the adjusted R2 values are reasonably high for this type 428 

of model.  429 

Results from Table 3 indicate that both consumers’ social pressure (subjective 430 

norms) and their Perceived Behavior Control positively affect consumers’ intentions to 431 

purchase organic olive oil, consistent with Chen (2007). However attitudes toward 432 

organic olive oil are negatively related to organic olive oil purchasing intention. This 433 



17 

 

result is not surprising. There are two arguments supporting it. First, Avitia et al. (2015) 434 

showed that although Spanish consumers valued the sustainable food attribute they were 435 

not willing to pay a premium for this attribute. Second, in the specific case of olive oil, 436 

Spanish consumers do associate extra virgin olive oil with health and sustainable 437 

characteristic irrespective of the type of production system (organic or conventional) 438 

(Calatrava, 2002 and Vega-Zamora et al., 2011), making differentiation between the 439 

two types of olive oil more difficult.  440 

Furthermore, only the variables “Food Involvement” and “Orderly Lifestyle” 441 

positively affect attitudes, which supports Hypotheses 1a and 1c., corroborating Chen 442 

(2007) and Bell and Marshall (2003), who state that consumers with higher food 443 

involvement personality traits have a more positive attitude toward organic food and are 444 

better able to discern healthier foods. Additionally, results reveal that an orderly 445 

lifestyle seems to enhance an individual’s attitude toward organic olive oil. Gracia and 446 

Magistris (2008) obtained similar results, suggesting that consumers trying to follow an 447 

orderly life are more likely to develop environmentally friendly attitudes and follow a 448 

healthier diet in which olive oil plays an important role. 449 

On the other hand, the relationships between attitudes, cooking skills, and healthy 450 

lifestyles are not significant (Hypotheses 1b and 1d are not supported). In both cases, 451 

this result is related to the perception of conventional olive oil as a healthy product, 452 

which already plays an important role in the Mediterranean diet. Organic olive oil is not 453 

perceived as healthier than its conventional counterpart, as mentioned above.  454 

“Knowledge,”  “Food Quality Involvement,” and “Price Involvement” 455 

significantly and positively affect consumer’s Perceived Behavioral Control, which 456 

supports Hypotheses 2a and 2c but rejects Hypothesis 2b. Although the standardized 457 

factor loading of “Price Involvement” was significantly different from zero, its positive 458 

coefficient led us to reject its associated hypothesis (2b). This finding is consistent with 459 

Eertmans et al. (2005), who stated that price was negatively related to healthy diet.  460 

4.3. The choice model: consumer’s preferences for olive oil attributes 461 

The second step in the HCM consists of estimating an RPL model that incorporates 462 

latent variables (LV) obtained from the SEM. The estimated utility function includes all 463 

attribute levels defined as effect-coded, except the price attribute, which is introduced as 464 



18 

 

a continuous variable as well as LVs. Socio-demographic variables, such as gender 465 

(GEND), age (AGE) and town size (TS), are defined as dummy variables (1 466 

representing women, age less than 50 years, and town size over 10000 inhabitants, 467 

respectively). The education level includes three categories: university degree (UNIV), 468 

completed secondary school (SECOND) and primary school. Thus, two effect-coded 469 

dummy variables were defined. The first one was university degree (UNIV), which took 470 

the value 1 if the respondent had a university degree, 0 if the respondent has completed 471 

secondary school, and -1, otherwise. The second education dummy was having 472 

completed secondary school (SECOND), which took the value 1 if the respondents had 473 

completed secondary school, 0 if the respondent had a university degree, and -1, 474 

otherwise. Finally, all random parameters were assumed to be normally distributed.  475 

Table 4 shows the estimated parameters from the RPL model. The no-option 476 

coefficient is negative and significant, which indicates that most of the respondents 477 

participated in the choice experiment by choosing one of the proposed olive oil 478 

alternatives instead of the no-option. The results also reveal that the organic attribute 479 

generates a disutility to consumers, while the most preferred olive oil is the one 480 

produced under a PDO. In line with Calatrava (2002), the organic attribute does not 481 

represent any additional value to Spanish consumers.  482 

This finding contradicts the results reported in other studies, such as Gracia and 483 

Magistris (2008) for Italy, Soler et al. (2002), and Vega-Zamora et al. (2011) for Spain, 484 

or Tsakiridou et al. (2006) for Greece. However in these studies, consumers were only 485 

required to choose between organic olive oil and its conventional counterpart, whereas 486 

we have considered the trade-offs not only with other olive oil attributes but also with 487 

other attribute levels within the production system (i.e., PDO) in our study. Moreover,  488 

environmental concerns are not a key factor in a consumer’s food choices, especially in 489 

the case of olive oil (Vega-Zamora et al., 2011). ` 490 

Contrary to the organic attribute, Catalonian consumers show a strong preference 491 

for PDO extra virgin olive oil. PDO extra virgin olive oil is well known among 492 

Catalonian and Spanish consumers. Twenty-eight PDO brands exist in Spain, and five 493 

of them are located in Catalonia. Additionally, the production of this type of olive oil 494 

continues to grow; the domestic market and, to a lesser extent, the EU are its main 495 

destinations (Ruiz-Castillo, 2008).  496 



19 

 

The results further reveal that the price parameter is negative and significant 497 

(Menapace et al., 2011; Vega-Zamora et al., 2011). The local origin of olive oil plays an 498 

important role in shaping consumer’s preferences in Catalonia. Catalan olive oils are 499 

preferred over other Spanish or imported oils, while olive oil produced in other Spanish 500 

regions is preferred over imported olive oil, as in Jiménez-Guerrero et al. (2012). In 501 

contrast, the specific brand did not significantly impact consumers’ utilities, which 502 

indicates that respondents are more interested in the origin of extra-virgin olive oil than 503 

in the origin of the brand. This result could be related to the fact that many consumers 504 

do not recognize the origin of the brand (that is, whether the manufacturer is located or 505 

not in Catalonia). The results also show that consumers do not value private labels for 506 

this specific product in general.  507 

Interestingly, almost all personal trait LVs (except orderly lifestyle) significantly 508 

affected the respondents’ preferences for extra virgin olive oil (Table 4). In line with 509 

previous results, we note that the sign of the variable “Healthy Lifestyle” is negative 510 

and significant. Consistent with previous results about the organic attribute, a healthy 511 

lifestyle is not related to the selection of olive oil, although healthy lifestyles may be 512 

conducive to healthier food choices (Losasso et al., 2012). In Catalonia, olive oil is 513 

perceived as a key feature of the traditional Mediterranean diet, and is widely used by 514 

consumers independently from their particular cooking habits or diets. This fact also can 515 

explain the negative sign of the coefficient related to the variable “Cooking Skills”.  516 

The other three variables, “Food Involvement”, “Price Involvement”, and “Quality 517 

Involvement” positively affect consumers’ preferences for extra virgin olive oil (Table 518 

4). A large number of extra virgin olive oil options are available in Catalonian markets, 519 

which can accommodate a broad range of preferences. People looking for good prices 520 

can easily meet their preference either by buying directly from the producer or 521 

cooperative (30 percent of our sample) or by choosing a promoted product at a retail 522 

outlet. Those looking for quality can also easily fit their preference.  523 

Table 4 (middle part) shows that the standard deviations of all relevant attributes 524 

and personal traits are significant, which indicates heterogeneity in the preferences of 525 

Catalonian consumers. The negative effect of healthy lifestyles on consumers’ 526 

preferences is not homogeneous across the sample. In fact, the negative coefficient 527 

becomes positive for women and younger people. The negative effect is mitigated for 528 



20 

 

respondents that have completed secondary school, but increases for people living in 529 

larger towns. The negative effect of cooking skills is mitigated in the case of women 530 

and well-educated people.  531 

The positive effect of food involvement on consumer’s utility increases for women 532 

and the highest educated population, but it becomes negative for younger respondents. 533 

The positive effect of “Price Involvement” is mitigated for women and the better-534 

educated population, but significantly increases for people living in larger towns. The 535 

positive effect on the consumer’s quality involvement when shopping is mitigated in 536 

larger towns and, practically disappears in the case of women.  537 

Finally, behavioral LVs affect the utility assigned to the organic attribute. 538 

However, this attribute negatively affects the utility of consumers, as mentioned above. 539 

The interaction parameters found at the lower part of Table 4 indicate that this negative 540 

effect is partially mitigated in consumers affected by subjective norms or with a positive 541 

attitude toward organic food. Nevertheless, the organic attribute does not seem to play a 542 

significant role in the extra virgin olive oil market. 543 

 544 

5. Conclusions 545 

The use of limited information models, such as conventional choice models, could 546 

be problematic if the decision-making process is strongly conditioned by consumers’ 547 

personality traits and lifestyles. In this paper, an HCM was applied to understand the 548 

consumer’s behavioral process related to the purchase of extra-virgin olive oil in 549 

Catalonia. Special attention was paid to the organic attribute of the oil. This approach 550 

has been proven to be flexible enough to investigate the effect of consumers’ food-551 

related personality traits, lifestyles, and purchasing habits on their purchase intentions 552 

regarding organic olive oil as well as to ascertain the main determinants of consumer 553 

choice when buying extra-virgin olive oil. 554 

The results from this study suggest that almost all personal trait LVs significantly 555 

affect respondents’ utilities toward extra virgin olive oil. “Healthy lifestyle” is 556 

significantly but negatively associated with extra virgin olive oil utility, which shows 557 

that olive oil preferences in Catalonia respond more to dietary traditions than to healthy 558 

food choices. Nevertheless, this result was not homogeneous across the sample. In fact, 559 



21 

 

the negative effect of “Healthy Lifestyle” was mitigated in women. This result shows 560 

that this population segment cares more about diet and the impact of food on health and 561 

thus bases its food choices on health reasons.  562 

Food-related activities (cooking skills) are more related to social and personal 563 

activities than to healthy food measures. Extra virgin olive oil is normally used in 564 

Catalonia for salads, boiled vegetables, or grilled food. People with superior cooking 565 

skills attempt to use alternative products to traditional olive oil.  566 

The variables “Price Involvement” and “Quality Involvement” also significantly 567 

and positively affect the respondents’ attitudes toward extra virgin olive oil. These 568 

factors are both associated with the “Perceived Behavioral Control” construct, 569 

expressing the importance of available resources and opportunities in reinforcing 570 

consumers’ perceptions. However, the effect of these two variables is not homogeneous. 571 

Significant differences were found for people living in larger towns. While the overall 572 

positive effect of “Price Involvement” increases in larger towns, the positive effect of 573 

“Quality Involvement” is significantly mitigated.  574 

The results also suggest that Catalan consumers perceive a disutility from the 575 

organic attribute compared to other production system alternatives (conventional and 576 

PDO). The price is not a relevant factor to explain this result, as organic olive oils are 577 

cheaper than PDO olive oils on average. Environmental or health concerns seem not to 578 

be relevant to consumers’ choices related to olive oil. The organic attribute is not 579 

perceived as a significant quality cue, whereas people looking for quality select PDO 580 

extra virgin olive oil. This result suggests that traditional marketing strategies that have 581 

been used in Catalonia to promote the consumption of olive oils based on environmental 582 

or health issues are not effective.  583 

The results also indicate that the role of policy makers in the Spanish olive oil 584 

sector should be re-assessed. In June 2012, the Commission launched an action plan for 585 

the EU olive oil sector, which established six main areas among which quality control 586 

and promotion were included. During the last few years in Spain there has been a 587 

“premiumization” of olive oil, with the introduction of significant innovations in 588 

varieties, packaging, etcetera. These innovations have been the focus of promotional 589 

campaigns jointly financed by producer organizations and public institutions to increase 590 

consumers’ awareness of the health benefits of olive oil. These campaigns have been 591 



22 

 

proven to be effective in export markets but have not been a commercial success in the 592 

domestic market.  593 

This study has shown the relevance of behavioral control on shaping consumers 594 

intentions toward olive oil. Policy actions on improving consumers’ perception of 595 

control on the olive oil market seem to be needed in Spain. Olive oil is part of the 596 

Spanish culture, but this does not mean that consumers have a good knowledge of types 597 

of olive oil, quality grades, etc. Public institutions should provide more information in 598 

an increasingly differentiated market. If policy makers aim at promoting sustainable 599 

production of olive oil for the domestic market the attributes “Organic” and “Local” 600 

should be reinforced with appropriate information campaigns about the characteristics 601 

of these attributes and adequate control mechanisms should be in place to strengthen 602 

authenticity and protect consumers.  603 

The results of this study reinforce the need to include the psychological 604 

characteristics of consumers, such as attitudes, food-related personality traits, purchase 605 

habits, and lifestyle orientation, to explain how individuals make food choices and to 606 

understand their decision-making processes. These findings are likely to encourage a 607 

more widespread application of the HCM in the agro-food marketing field. From a 608 

methodological point of view, more research should be addressed to providing new 609 

tools to estimate the HCM while considering heterogeneity across individuals.  610
