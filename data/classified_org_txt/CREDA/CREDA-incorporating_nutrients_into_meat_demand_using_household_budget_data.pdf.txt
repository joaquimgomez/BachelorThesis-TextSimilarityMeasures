Abstract 
 
The objective of this paper is to analyze the Spanish demand for meat taking into account the 

consumer’s concern about the relationship between food diet and health. This concern is 

forcing food demand analysts to assume that consumer utility is a function of nutrients 

instead of simply the food products themselves. Nevertheless, these utility function 

arguments are not produced in the marketplace but rather at home. As a consequence, in this 

paper household production theory is followed in order to analyze Spanish demand for meat 

using the Quarterly National Expenditure Survey for 1999. Demands for several meat 

products (the input in the model) are derived from the translog cost function. Censored 

regression models are used in the estimation process, since many zero responses are reported. 

Five broad categories, eight nutrients and the most relevant socio-economic variables are 

considered. Finally, a set of elasticities is calculated with respect to all the variables included 

in the analysis.

1. Introduction 

In recent years there has been a general concern about the relationship between health 

and food diet. In most developed economies the incidence of cancer, cardiovascular disease 

and other mortal diseases is growing at an alarming rate. Willet (1994) has pointed out that an 

unbalanced food diet could explain this trend. 

 

In the last twenty years a number of papers have analyzed this relationship. Capps and 

Schmitz (1991), Burton and Young (1996), Kinnucan et al. (1997), Kim and Chern (1999), 

and Ben Kaabia et al. (2001), among others, incorporate so-called “health information 

indexes” into food demand systems in order to take into account the effect of the consumer’s 

knowledge about the relation between nutrients and health. As regards cross-sectional data 

analyzes, most of the literature incorporating nutritional information measures the impact of 

income, prices and socio-demographic variables on nutrient intakes. Two different 

measurement techniques are typically used. ‘Direct’ measurements are obtained through a 

regression of nutrient intake on relevant variables (Adrian and Daniel, 1976; Nayga, 1994; 

Ramezani, 1995; Subramanian and Deaton, 1996; Chesher, 1998; among others). 

Alternatively, ‘indirect’ measurements are made in two steps. First, the relevant variable 

effects on the demand for food products are calculated by estimating a demand system. Then, 

nutrient intake effects are obtained by applying nutrient conversion factors to these food 

effects (Xiao and Taylor, 1995; Ramezani et al., 1995; and Huang, 1999). 

 

Nevertheless, most studies that use cross-sectional data analyze the demand for 

nutrients more than the demand for food. The applicability of such results is limited, since 

nutrients are not directly available in the market. It would be more useful to incorporate the 

new nutrient intake awareness into a demand model that enables us to make conclusions 

about food demand (in terms of changes in quantities consumed of different products) rather 

than nutrient demand. 

 

The aim of this paper is to use such an approach to analyze the Spanish demand for 

meat. Apart from other nutritional characteristics, meat products, together with eggs, cow’s 

milk and fish, are often referred as high-quality protein providers for human health. Although 

from the standpoint of nutrition, the human body does not require proteins per se, it requires 

essential amino acids that are present in dietary proteins. They are called essential as they 



 3

cannot be synthesized by mammals, at least in the amounts needed, and are therefore 

essential constituents of a balanced diet for humans.1 

 

From the methodological point of view it is assumed that the consumer utility 

function is a function of nutrients and not of the goods themselves. It is not unrealistic to 

assume that consumers are starting to think more in terms of food nutrients than in terms of 

food products, while also taking into account prices and disposable income. Also, it is 

assumed that these utility function arguments are best obtained through a household 

production technology, using the consumed food products as the main inputs. Once a 

functional form for the obtained cost function is adjusted, the analysis of food demand can be 

carried out as an analysis of input demand. Finally, the model is improved incorporating 

certain socio-economic variables. The model is estimated using the Quarterly National 

Expenditure Survey for 1999. Since a large number of zero purchases are reported, several 

models taking this problem into account are estimated and tested. 

 

The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents some descriptive data on 

meat demand in Spain. Afterwards, the theoretical model is explained. Next, the data are 

described and then the main results are presented. The paper ends with some concluding 

remarks. 

 

 

2. The demand for meat in Spain 

 

Spanish food demand structure has stabilized in the last few years. According to data 

from the Quarterly Household National Expenditure Survey for 1999, the average budget 

shares of different types of meat, fish and eggs in relation to total food expenditure were: 

beef, 9.12%; pork, 6.42%; poultry, 6.71%; fish, 11.54%; and, finally, eggs, 2.66%.2 

However, important family differences appear in relation to certain household characteristics, 

as shown in Table 1. Fish has the largest share for all categories of household listed, except 

when the education level is ‘secondary school’, when the age of the household head is under 

30 and when the percentage of members between 14 and 29 years old exceeds 75%; in each 

of these cases the share of beef is the largest. Pork has the second largest share only in rural 

areas and the egg expenditure share is the lowest for all products. As the level of education of 

the head of the household increases, fish expenditure shares increase, while pork, poultry and 



 4

egg shares decrease. Similarly, as the size of the town of residence increases, beef and fish 

expenditure shares increase and the pork share decreases. As regards household size, it is 

observed that while in the cases of pork, poultry and eggs the highest expenditure share 

corresponds to relatively large households (5 or more members), in the cases of beef and fish 

it corresponds to smaller households (4 and 2 members for beef and fish, respectively). 

Finally, regarding age, it is observed that as the percentage of members under 14 years old 

increases, more of the food budget is spent on pork and poultry. 

 

 (Insert Table 1) 

 

Table 2 presents information on the contribution of meat products to total nutrient 

intake. Nutrients have been aggregated into the following eight broad categories: energy, 

proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, fibre, calcium and other minerals. Jointly 

considered, meats, fish and eggs provide 16% of the total energy intake, 44% of the total 

protein intake, 27% of the lipid intake as well as an important percentage of other minerals 

and vitamins.  

 

(Insert Table 2) 

 

 

3. Methodology 

 

The basic assumption of the model is that, at least in more developed countries, 

nutrient intake is becoming a more important determinant of food demand. In this paper it is 

assumed that the consumer's preferences are influenced by food characteristics. This 

approach is in line with the consumer goods characteristics model introduced by Ladd and 

Suvannunt (1976) and the hedonic model discussed by Nerlove (1995)3. In this scheme, 

consumers have complete quasi-ordering over the set of all possible characteristic collections, 

which requires that preference ordering is transitive and complete. Furthermore, continuity 

and strict convexity assumptions are also satisfied.4 Nevertheless, in this framework, 

assumptions of non-satiation and positive desire of all characteristics cannot be satisfied in all 

cases.5 That is, there is nothing to guarantee that consumers’ reaction to all characteristics are 

always positive, in the sense that everyone prefers more rather than less of each 

characteristic, other things being equal. Due to this fact, in this approach, it is necessary to 



 5

determine how to deal with ‘negative’ characteristics. Following Lancaster (1971), the 

appropriate strategy depends on the universality of such ‘negative’ reactions. That is, if the 

reaction to a characteristic is universally negative (everyone prefers less of a certain 

characteristic), the general structure of the analysis is preserved by simply taking the negative 

of that characteristic. But it may be the case that some individuals can react to the same 

characteristic positively while others react negatively, or even that a particular individual can 

react positively at certain levels and negatively at others. In such cases, the efficiency criteria 

are no longer universal. Whether to adopt the sign change technique when there are divided 

reactions to a given characteristic is a matter of choice on an ad hoc basis. If the distribution 

of preferences were such that most consumers viewed the characteristics negatively, it would 

presumably be convenient to change its sign; otherwise, it would be better to preserve it.  

 

Following household production theory (Becker, 1965; Lancaster, 1971), we assume 

that the vector a = [a1,...,ar, ar+1,...,ap ] represents the levels of r nutrients and p-r 

characteristics provided by food products (taste, smell, appearance, etc.). Of course, the 

components of a are not directly sold in the market but they must be obtained using different 

types of inputs. Furthermore, let q=[q1,...,qn, l1,...,ls] represent the total set of inputs needed in 

the production process which can be decomposed into a vector of n food inputs (qf, f=1,...,n) 

and s labour inputs (lb, b=1,...,s) which can be bought in the market at prices p=[p1,...,pn, 

s1,...,ss ]. Correspondingly, pf represents the prices of food inputs and sb the wages of labour 

inputs. In this study, the vector a represents the new argument of the consumer utility 

function.  

 

Households purchase market goods in quantities q with the purpose of jointly 

producing non-market commodities a which yield utility according to U = U (a), where U ( ) 

is assumed to be quasi-concave. Let the joint production function be F(q, a) = 0.6 It is 

assumed that F ( ) is ‘neoclassical’; that is, given q, the production possibility frontier in a is 

concave, and the isoquants in q given a are convex. In addition, the traditional budget 

constraint y = p’q holds. This optimisation problem can be solved in two stages:  

 

 In the first stage, the household tries to minimise the cost (C = p’q) of producing any 

given bundle a. From the Lagrangian: l1= p’q + π (F (q,a)), the following cost function is 

obtained, which represents the minimal short-run cost of obtaining a bundle a at given prices 



 6

p: 

C = C (p, a).                                                                     (1) 

  

 In the second stage of the procedure, the household tries to maximize the utility 

function U = U (a) subject to the constraint y = C (p, a). Solving the first order conditions 

derived from the Lagrangian, l2= U (a) + λ ( y - C (p, a) ), demand functions for the 

commodities included in bundle a are obtained:  

ak = ak (y, π)                   k=1,..., p,                                     (2) 

where y is the total budget and π =(π�, ...,  πp) is the vector of the shadow prices. 

 

Once the theoretical foundation is established, and taking into account that the main 

interest of this study is to present the final conclusions in terms of products available in the 

market, we will only concentrate on the first stage of the procedure. This will enable us to 

form conclusions about food products, considered as the main necessary inputs that enable 

food consumers to get those commodities they consider valuable.  

 

To attain this objective, a functional form for (1) has to be chosen. The translog cost 

function is adopted, since it has been widely used in related literature. Formally, this cost 

function can be written as: 

kii k ikhkk h kh

Differentiating (3) with respect to each of the input prices and applying Shephard’s 

lemma, input budget share equations can be derived as follows: 

 

kk ikjj ijiii

where wi  = qi pi /C is the i
th input budget share. 

 

 The α  and θ  parameters show the effect of changes in p and a on factor shares, 

respectively. If ikθ equals zero for all i and k, the household production technology is 



 7

homothetic, meaning that the input shares are not affected by the levels of various nutrients or 

food characteristics. 

 

 Finally, differences in the expenditure allocation explained by the relevant socio-

economic household characteristics are gathered through the introduction of all these 

variables (denoted by SEg, g = 1,...,z), thought the independent term. Then, in (4) iα  is 

substituted by (Pollak and Wales, 1981):

4. Data and preliminary analyzes 

 

 Data come from the Spanish Quarterly Household National Expenditure Survey, 

which provides quarterly information on the expenditure and quantity of various classes of 

food products consumed by a stratified random sample of 3,200 households. Each quarter, 

information is collected from each household during one week. Theoretically, one household 

stays in the survey for eight quarters. However, in practice, only a few households stay in the 

sample for the maximum period. So, for this study, we only include those households that 

participated throughout the year in question, 1999. This strategy leads to a final sample of 

1657 households. Consumption is aggregated in order to obtain yearly food consumption.  

 

 The survey gathers information on a limited number of household characteristics 

including the level of education and main activity of the head of the household, household 

income, household size, age and sex of family members and town size, among others. 

Nevertheless, no information is provided either in relation to labour inputs in meal 

preparation or with respect to the wage paid to meal preparers. As a consequence, the labour 

variables and the wages are deleted from vectors q and p, respectively. In a similar way, 

while it is possible to measure nutrient intakes by applying conversion factors to the 

consumed quantities, it is impossible to measure the rest of the perceived food characteristics 

such as taste, smell or appearance. To be consistent with previous literature7, we assume that 

differences in tastes and in other non-observable attributes are mainly represented by, and are 

determined by, the differences in household characteristics gathered in (5).

Using this household information and the model defined in the previous section, we 

must now isolate meat demand from other food groups. If weak separability of preferences 

applies, then multistage budgeting would allow us to focus only on meat products without 

considering the rest, thereby obtaining conditioned demand elasticities. If not, another 

solution must be found.  

 

Let us consider this question. As the model stands, the consumer utility function 

depends on attributes obtained from goods instead of depending on the goods themselves. 

Using this scheme, we suppose that, in general, a food group will be analyzed separately from 

other types of goods such as clothes, footwear, etc., due to the fact that the marginal 

substitution relationship between any pair of nutrients (or any other characteristic) will be, in 

general terms, independent from any type of attribute, as might characterize clothes, 

footwear, etc.8 Nevertheless, does the same statement apply in comparing different food 

groups such as cereals, meat, fats, vegetables...? In other words, is the marginal substitution 

relationship between calories and proteins coming from cereals independent from calories 

coming from meat, for instance? In our view the answer is generally ‘no’, because a rational 

consumer tries to get a nutritionally balanced diet without considering the origin of the 

nutrients. That is, consumers do not distribute their purchases in order to obtain a concrete 

percentage of total nutrients from a certain food group. They are interested in total nutrient 

intake. Hence, we can conclude that the second stage of multistage budgeting does not apply 

to the case under study.  

 

Taking into account the habits of Spanish food consumers as mentioned in Section 2, 

we analyze the different types of meat for which data are available -beef, pork and poultry- as 

well as fish and eggs. One of the following two alternatives must be chosen: 1) specify a food 

demand system with various classes of food products (different types of cereals, meat, fats, 

vegetables...); or 2) specify a system that includes the meat categories under study together 

with one last category that covers the rest of the food groups. Although this last category 

represents a quite heterogeneous aggregate, its equation could be the one deleted from the 

system to avoid the singularity of the residual matrix due to the adding-up condition of a 

demand system. The first strategy, although theoretically accurate, results in a less 

parsimonious model. In addition, the second alternative allows us to concentrate our attention 

on the demand for animal products. Hence, the second alternative is preferred, although 



 9

separability tests will be carried out to check whether this decision is supported by the data. 

 

Many concepts of separability have been used, including the distinction as to whether 

there is weak or strong separability, separability of the utility function (direct), separability of 

the indirect utility function (indirect), separability of the cost or distance function (quasi), 

separability of an implicit representation of the direct utility function (direct pseudo), and, 

finally, separability of an implicit representation of the indirect utility function (indirect 

pseudo). Pudney (1981) provides a formal definition of each and uses them to impose and test 

separability in a simple constant elasticity model. Although each definition requires a 

different set of parametric restrictions, Pudney shows that the various definitions available 

make little difference to the empirical results. Consequently, following Hayes et al. (1990), 

only the quasi-separability of our cost function will be tested. 

  

Generally, preferences are quasi-separable if the cost function defined in (1) can also 

be written as:  

 

( ) [ ]),(,...,),(, 11 apgapgGapC dd= ,                    (6) 
 

where goods are portioned into d  groups with the price subvector dpp ,...,1 , G is interpreted 

as a macro cost function and dg is interpreted as a price index for group d . 

  

Following Deaton and Muellbauer (1980a, p. 134), the group budget shares

where deα is the estimated cross-price parameter between groups d and e , which can be 

estimated from an aggregate model that has shares dCw  and eCw  as dependent variables. 

Hence, the restriction that is implied by the quasi-separability of the cost function may be 

written in terms of known shares and estimated parameters as: 

dejeididje ww αα = .                                                           (11) 

 

In other words, two groups, d  and e , may be considered separable if the 

compensated cross-price effects between the share of good i  in group d  and the price of 

good j  in group e ( de ≠ ), satisfy the restriction in (11).  

 

In order to implement this procedure, we must first decide which explanatory 

variables to include in the system. Taking equations (4) and (5) into account, the following 

variables are included: 1) the logarithm of the prices of the types of meat under consideration 

as well as the logarithm of a price for the rest of the food groups;9 2) the logarithm of total 

nutrient intake (kilocalories, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, proteins, fibre, calcium and other 

minerals); and finally, 3) the following socio-economic characteristics of households to 

capture differences in non-observable food attributes: total per capita food expenditure (as an 



 11

approximation of per capita income), the size of the town in which the household lives, the 

level of education of the head of the household, the household size and the percentage of 

household members within several age intervals. The categories considered for the last three 

variables are those indicated in Table 1. Of these variables, total per capita food expenditure 

and/or nutrient intakes may not be exogenous10. Furthermore, regarding consumers’ reaction 

to nutrients, it is supposed that although there could be divided reactions to some of them 

(mainly kilocalories and lipids), reactions are far from being universal.11 Therefore, following 

Lancaster, the sign change technique is not adopted in any case.  

 

Next, separability tests are carried out in order to determine whether our previous 

assumptions are confirmed by the data. The sequential procedure is straightforward. To test 

the null hypothesis of quasi-separability between meat (beef, pork and poultry) and fish, the 

following procedure has been followed. First, an estimate of deα  is obtained by using a two-

good model to explain the shares of meat and fish. A second model is then estimated in which 

individual meat and fish group shares are dependent variables. The predicted shares of the 

individual meats are multiplied by deα  to obtain a set of parametric restrictions that are then 

placed on the cross-price terms between each meat price and the fish group price. A 

likelihood ratio test is then performed to determine if the restrictions are accepted by the data. 

The calculated likelihood ratio is 26.42, which is higher than the critical value at the 5% level 

of significance, 81.7)3(2 =χ . Hence, at mean values, the null of separability is rejected and, 

as a consequence, the different types of meat and fish must be incorporated into a single 

system. Taking this into account, we next determine whether these meat products and eggs 

can be jointly considered in the system. Following an analogous procedure, we obtain a 

likelihood ratio of 51.73, which also is greater than the critical one at the 5% level, 

48.9)4(2 =χ . Hence, beef, pork, poultry, fish and eggs form part of the same demand 

system. Finally, the analogous procedure is carried out to check the separability of previous 

products and the aggregate ‘rest of food products’. In this case, the likelihood ratio takes a 

value of 62.96, higher than the critical value of 07.11)5(2 =χ , at the 5% level. Hence, we 

conclude that the chosen alternative to meet our objective of analysing the demand for 

different meat products is not rejected by the data.  

 

 

5. Estimation results 



 12

 

Zero expenditure problem 

 

When cross-sectional data are used for the demand analyzes of specific products, a 

large number of zero purchases can be reported during short survey periods. For instance, for 

the Spanish data we are using, households have recorded their consumption during only one 

week.12 For this kind of data, an ordinary least squares estimation that is either based on all, 

or on only the positive responses, generates biased parameter estimates (Amemiya, 1984). In 

addition, excluding the null responses also causes efficiency losses and, in most cases, 

inconsistency. Therefore, a model that takes into account the censored nature of the data must 

be specified.  

 

In early studies, the Tobit model was widely used, but this is only appropriate if the 

zero observation is a corner solution (it assumes that all households potentially consume the 

product). In recent studies, other models that take into account different explanations for zero 

purchases have been used. Generally, there are three reasons for a zero expenditure: 1) the 

survey period is too short to allow consumers to report the purchase of a specific product 

(infrequency of purchase), 2) consumers are not willing to buy the product (abstention) and, 

3) consumers do not purchase the product at current prices and income levels (corner 

solution). 

 

 Censored demand models can be classified into two broad categories: 1) double-

hurdle models and 2) infrequency models. One advantage of these models is that both 

decisions, whether to buy and how much to buy, may depend on different sets of explanatory 

variables. In addition, these decisions can be jointly or independently modelled, deriving, 

respectively, the simultaneous and the independent versions of the models. Let ui and vi be the 

error terms corresponding to the decisions to buy and how much to buy, respectively. The 

joint distribution of both error terms in the simultaneous versions of the two broad model 

categories is given by:

where BVN denotes bivariate normal and ρ  is a correlation coefficient. 

 



 13

 On the other hand if ui and vi are assumed to be independent (that is, 0=ρ ) and ui  ∼ 

N(0,1), and vi ∼N(0,σ
2), the independent versions of two model categories is obtained. 

 

 Behind the Double-Hurdle Model (DH) is the idea that a consumer has to overcome 

two hurdles before making a purchase: 1) to decide to participate in the market (potential 

consumer); and 2) to actually buy. A zero expenditure is recorded in those cases where 

consumers either decide not to participate in the market, or having decided to participate, they 

eventually do not buy. In the first decision, any value of the explanatory variables (price, 

income, etc.) is irrelevant, so non-purchase is due to conscientious abstention. In the second 

one, potential consumers do not buy the product due to the existing levels of the explanatory 

variables. Therefore, the DH specification is appropriate when zero expenditures result from 

true non-purchase responses that are based either on conscientious abstentions or economic 

factors. 

 

The Infrequent Purchase Model also assumes that a consumer faces two decisions 

before a positive expenditure is recorded. The first decision is whether to purchase or not 

(purchase decision), and the second decision, to actually buy. As regards zero expenditures, 

in this model a zero expenditure results from one of two following situations. On one hand, 

consumers have not purchased because as a habit the item is purchased infrequently (and not 

because of conscious abstention as in the DH model). On the other, there are consumers who, 

having decided to purchase, do not buy, basing their decision on economic factors (corner 

solution). In these cases the interpretation is similar to that in the DH model. This is called 

the Tobit-Infrequency of Purchase (TIP) model. 

 

There is a particular case in which, having decided to purchase, consumers always 

buy a positive amount of product (there are no corner solutions). Then the 

simultaneous/independent TIP model reduces to the simultaneous/independent Infrequency of 

Purchase Model (IP) defined by Blundell and Meghir (1987).  

 

Many versions of these models have been used in recent years (Blundell and Meghir, 

1987; Gao et al., 1995; Burton et al., 1996; Su and Yen, 1996; Yen and Jones, 1997; and 

Angulo et al., 2001, among others).

Model selection 

 

First, the three models defined above, in both versions, simultaneous and independent, 

are estimated for the five main categories (beef, pork, poultry, fish and eggs) using Time 

Series Processor software (TSP International, 2005).13 The maximum likelihood procedure 

and Newton’s estimation method for parameter covariance matrices are followed. Since 

heteroscedasticity is likely to be present in the different models, models with heteroscedastic 

errors are estimated by allowing the standard deviation, σi, to vary across observations. In 

particular, σi has been reparametrized as follows: 

                          )( exp = γσ ii H ,                                                             (13) 

 

where Hi represents the set of variables that generates the heteroscedastic problem. The 

exponential specification has the desired property that the standard deviation, σi, is strictly 

positive. In Table 3 we present the maximum likelihood estimation results for the different 

models, together with likelihood ratio values for testing the null hypotheses of homoscedastic 

errors.14 As can be observed, in all cases the null hypothesis is rejected and, consequently, 

heteroscedasticity is introduced in all models. 

 

(Insert Table 3) 

 

Second, a statistical test for non-nested models (Vuong, 1989) is implemented in 

order to determine which model best fits the actual consumer purchasing decisions. Results 

are shown in Table 4. The model selection process is divided in three steps. First, the 

independent versus the dependent version of each type of model is tested for all products. In 

all cases, the independent versions of the models seems to better fit the data. In a second step, 

the ITIP model is tested against the IIP one, since, as mentioned above, IIP is a special case 

of ITIP. As can be observed, in all cases the ITIP model is preferred. Finally, the ITIP models 

are tested against the IDH models. The last two rows of Table 4 summarise the results. While 

for beef, poultry and fish both models yield similar results, in the case of pork and eggs the 

ITIP models outperforms the IDH models.  

 

(Insert Table 4) 



 15

 

As the Voung test cannot distinguish between ITIP and IDH models for three out of 

five products, the test for non-nested models proposed by Clarke (2003) is implemented. 

Results are shown in Table 5 and indicate that the ITIP model outperforms the IDH model for 

all products but beef for which, as for the Voung test, ITIP and IDH models are not 

significantly different. 

 

(Insert Table 5) 

 

Third, we test whether total per capita food expenditure and/or nutrient intakes can be 

considered independent from the error term (exogeneity) using the Hausman test (Hausman, 

1978). An instrument for total per capita food expenditure frequently used in literature is per 

capita income, which is not available here. In addition, nutrient intakes are also quite difficult 

to instrument. We have decided to follow Wald (1940), and define each instrument as a 

dummy variable, which equals 1 when the value of the respective variable is over its mean, 

and 0 otherwise. The Hausman tests yield the following values: beef, 23.20; pork, 15.91; 

poultry, 25.42; fish, 41.78; and eggs, 19.56. As all these values are less than the critical value 

at the 5% level of significance [χ2(57)= 75.62], the null hypothesis of exogeneity cannot be 

rejected. 

 

Finally, the homotheticity hypothesis is tested applying a likelihood ratio test for each 

equation. The null hypothesis is clearly rejected since all the obtained values (309.29 for 

beef; 161.34 for pork; 454.21 for poultry; 242.60 for fish; and 122.96 for eggs) are well 

above the critical value at the 5% level of significance [ 51.15)8(2 =χ ]. Hence, we conclude 

that the levels of nutrients considered in this study do affect input shares. 

 

Summing up, two main conclusions are obtained from these tests. First, the Spanish 

meat consumer makes two independent decisions: to purchase or not, and how much to 

purchase. Independency is an important economic conclusion since it implies that consumers 

decide whether to buy a product without considering how much they are going to purchase. 

Second, since the ITIP model is never dominated, we conclude that Spanish zero expenditure 

responses are due to a decision of no consumption based on main economic determinants 

(income or prices) or purchasing habits (some goods are bought monthly or every fifteen days 



 16

and, then, it is possible that no record has been registered by the household during the week it 

was surveyed).15

The models are estimated by Maximum Likelihood. Estimated parameters (Table 6) 

have the expected signs and most of them are significant at the 5% level. In any case, and for 



 17

interpretation purposes, the most interesting indicators are the different demand elasticities 

that can be obtained from estimated parameters. 

 

(Insert Table 6) 

 

The first such elasticity is the so-called elasticity of participation. It measures the 

effect that a percentage change in one explanatory variable has on the likelihood of 

participating in the market. 16 The second elasticity relates to the probability of consumption. 

It reflects the effect that a percentage change in one explanatory variable has on the 

probability of consumption. Next, we have the elasticity of the conditional level of 

consumption, which measures the effect that a percentage change in a variable has on 

consumption once the decision to consume has been made. Finally, we calculate the elasticity 

of the unconditional level of consumption or total elasticity, which provides an overall 

assessment of the effect changes in one variable on consumption. All elasticities with respect 

to all continuous variables, together with their respective standard errors, are calculated for 

all products at sample means. Results are presented in Table 7.  

 

(Insert Table 7) 

 

Price and Income effects 

Although all own-price elasticities are negative, magnitudes differ considerably for 

the different types of elasticities. The elasticities of participation are much lower than the 

elasticities of the unconditional level of consumption. In other words, changes in own prices 

do not affect very much the decision to participate in the market. They mainly affect the 

quantity purchased. In this case, the demand for pork and poultry are the most elastic. 

  

With regard to cross-price effects, Table 7 shows that most of the elasticities of 

participation are insignificant.  The main exceptions are the positive relationships between 

changes in fish and pork prices and the probability of purchasing beef. The elasticities of the 

unconditional level of consumption show that fish and eggs are complementary goods 

whereas some substitutability exists between poultry with respect to beef and fish, as well as 

fish with respect to beef. 

 

 The elasticity of participation with respect to total food expenditure is positive for all 



 18

products, reflecting the fact that when total food expenditure increases (decreases), the 

probability of purchase also increases (decreases). Considering now the elasticity of the 

unconditional level of consumption, beef and fish can be considered luxury products; the 

expenditure elasticity for pork is around unity; and finally, poultry and eggs are necessities. 

The decomposition of the elasticities of the unconditional level of consumption into its two 

components shows that changes in total food expenditure affect consumption mainly through 

the conditional level and not through the probability of consumption. That is, an increase in 

total food expenditure is not likely to induce many marginal consumers to consume meat, but 

additional sales will likely come from existing consumers.  

 

Nutritive value effects 

Table 7 shows that the probabilities of purchasing all considered products generally 

increase (decrease) when total protein, lipid and vitamin intake also increases (decreases). 

The opposite takes place with respect to total energy intake. In general terms, most of the 

elasticities are rather small, indicating that increasing total nutrient intake has a rather small 

impact on the probability of buying meat products. For the elasticities of the unconditional 

level of consumption, results are as expected. As mentioned in the introduction, meat 

products are the main suppliers of a higher-quality protein intake. Thus, the highest positive 

elasticity corresponds to protein. From this point of view an increase in the total protein 

intake will mainly benefit beef and poultry. 

 

Analyzing the two components of this elasticity we can conclude that the increasing 

consumption of meat products due to an increase of the total protein intake will mainly come 

from existing consumers but also a significant increase of marginal consumers will take 

place. The elasticities of calcium and other minerals intake are negative, indicating that when 

the total intake of such nutrients increases consumers buy food products with a higher content 

of calcium and other minerals, and decrease meat consumption. Negative elasticities do not 

mean that meat products are undesirable. On the contrary, it means that other food products 

are more important suppliers of these specific nutrients, inducing consumers to increase the 

consumption of these products.  

 

Demographic effects 

 The elasticities of participation are positive with respect to the size of the household 

for all products. Moreover, as the number of members within a household increases, the 



 19

unconditional level of beef consumption also increases, while the consumption of the rest of 

the products do not significantly react to household size changes. As regards the elasticities 

of family composition (measured as the percentages of household members in several age 

categories), Table 7 shows that as the percentage of members between 14 and 59 increases, 

the probability of purchasing poultry also increases, while the probability of purchasing fish 

decreases. Similarly, the older the members of a household are, the lower the level of pork 

consumption and the higher the level of fish consumption. 

 

Finally, the effects of the level of education and town size are analyzed. Since dummy 

variables have been defined to take these effects into account, marginal effects are calculated. 

The principal results from these analyzes are shown in Table 8. The level of education is 

positively related to the probability of purchasing beef and negatively related to the 

probability of purchasing pork. Households with higher level of education consume larger 

quantities of beef and fish, and less pork, poultry and eggs. Results also indicate that those 

living in the smallest towns (less than 50,000 inhabitants) are the least likely to purchase 

beef. Beef and fish consumption is higher in large towns (between 50,001 and 500,000 

inhabitants) while more pork, poultry and eggs are consumed in smaller towns.   

(Insert Table 8) 

 

Implicit prices 

 
 As a final step in our study, and following Nerlove (1995), we derive implicit prices 

that Spanish consumers attach to the marginal unit of the different nutrients contained in the 

different products. Using calculated total price and nutrient elasticities together with sample 

mean values for per capita nutrient intake and prices, implicit prices adopt the following 

expression17:

 Results are shown in Table 9. Not that negative marginal prices are consistent with 

the Consumer Goods Characteristic Model as some products attributes may be undesirable 

(Ladd and Suvannunt, 1976). Adding more of one of these characteristics to a specific 

product may reduce its value to consumers. In any case, in this study most negative values are 

close to zero and are related to nutrients, which are only contained marginally in meat 

products. As mentioned in the introduction, meat products are main providers of high quality 

proteins. From this point of view, Spanish consumers perceive beef as the highest quality 

meat in terms of protein intake and eggs as the lowest quality protein source. Implicit prices 

for proteins are similar for the other meat products. 

 

(Insert Table 9) 

 

 Finally, to measure to what extent the demand elasticities are affected by the inclusion 

of nutrient values, we estimate a traditional Almost Ideal System (AIDS) model (Deaton and 

Muellbauer, 1980b), in the form of a ITIP model for comparison purposes, only including 

income, prices and household characteristics as main food demand determinants. Table 10 

shows obtained results of the elasticity of participation and the elasticity of the unconditional 

level of consumption. Several tests have been performed in order to check if significant 

differences exist between these elasticities and those shown in Table 7. As can be observed in 

Table 11, the differences are significant in most cases. From the comparison of magnitudes 

obtained for both types of elasticities, it can be observed that greatest differences are 

observed with respect to expenditure elasticities. The elasticity of participation with respect 

to total food expenditure is substantially lower when nutrient values are included. Finally, the 

elasticity of the unconditional level of consumption increases for beef and fish when nutrients 

are included and decreases for the other products.  

 

(Insert Tables 10 and 11) 

 

6. Concluding remarks 

 

In this paper, the demand for meat is analyzed taking into account its nutritional 

characteristics based on the assumption that, at least in more developed countries, nutrient 

intake is an increasingly important determinant of food demand. The model is constructed so 

that the consumer’s utility function does not depend on meat quantities but is a function of 



 21

nutrient intakes and other prepared food characteristics. Since these new utility function 

arguments are not directly available in the market, they are derived from several inputs using 

household production theory. Finally, non-observable characteristics such as taste or smell 

are indirectly considered in the final model by introducing the most relevant household 

socioeconomic characteristics. 

 

In order to validate the model obtained, the Spanish demand for meat is analyzed 

using micro level data. Since a large number of zero responses were obtained, several 

censored regression models are used and formal tests have been carried out to select the 

model that best fits the data. From the estimated parameters, meat demand elasticities with 

respect to price, nutrient content, expenditure and the rest of the included demographic 

variables are derived.  

 

Two main sets of results are obtained. First, from the selected models, we deduce that 

zero responses are mainly due to a rational decision not to consume, based either on 

economic factors or on purchasing habits. Second, from the calculated elasticities, the 

following principal implications are obtained: i) changes in own prices mainly affect the 

quantity of meat purchased and not the decision to purchase or not; ii) the probability of 

purchasing beef is positively related to changes in fish and pork prices; iii) fish and eggs are 

complementary goods while some substitutability exists between poultry with respect to beef 

and fish, as well as between fish and beef; iv) as regards nutrient intake, the highest positive 

unconditional elasticity corresponds to total protein intake; v) all considered products are 

more likely to be purchased as total food expenditure increases; vi) beef, fish and, less 

clearly, pork are luxuries while poultry and eggs are necessities; vii) the probability of 

purchasing all products as well as beef consumption increase with household size; viii) fish 

consumption increases as the members of a household get older; ix) there is a positive 

relationship between the education level of the head of household and the probability of 

purchasing beef as well as the consumption of beef and fish; and finally, x) households living 

in large towns tend to consume more beef and fish.  

 

 The approach we employ can provide new insights into food consumption behavior. 

Moreover, it is important to note that the main advantage of the model that we propose, in 

comparison with alternatives presented in the literature, is not the possibility to obtain 

nutrient intake elasticities but to offer a new framework in which demand elasticities (income 



 22

and prices) are determined by nutrient content. As demonstrated in last section, estimated 

demand elasticities differ substantially depending on whether or not nutrient variables are 

introduced. 

  

 Future research could be directed towards refining some of the econometric issues 

raised here. One of these issues concerns the exogeneity of the total expenditure and nutrient 

intake variables. Although in this paper the null of exogeneity is not rejected, it is not entirely 

clear that appropriate instruments have been used. Other instruments could be designed in the 

form of indexes to better cope with this problem.

NOTES 

                                                 
1 The FAO suggests that the protein contribution to total energy intake should lie between 12 and 15%. 

2 Food expenditure at home represents 91.2% of total food expenditure. Fish and eggs expenditure shares are 
included in the same system because they are assumed to be close substitutes for meat when preparing meals, 
since they are also an important source of protein in Spain. 

3 Furthermore, with respect to meats, the model proposed by Gao at al. (1997a) captures the essence of the 
present model. 

4 The assumptions considered up until now summarize consumer‘s preferences in terms of a utility function 
whose contours (indifference curves) are strictly convex towards the origin. 

5 These two latest assumptions, together with the previous ones, guarantee that the consumer’s preferences can 
be expressed in terms of an ordinal utility function of the neoclassical type. 

6 Capital stocks are considered fixed in the short-run. 

7 See the discussion on this topic in Gao at al. (1997a). 

8 We say “in general” because there are some specific segments of population for which this may not be 
absolutely true, for instance those engaging in sports.  

9 As prices are recorded, unit values are taken as proxies for market prices after adjusting them by quality effects. 
This adjustment results from the estimation of a hedonic equation that relates unit values to product qualities. 
Cowling and Raynor (1970), Cox and Wohlgenant (1986), Gao et al. (1995) and Gao et al. (1997b) use similar 
price adjustments. 

10 Since total nutrient intakes are calculated by applying conversion factors to the consumed quantities, it could 
be a problem of econometric endogeneity. 

11 In Spain, obesity is not as worrisome problem as in other countries (the United States, for instance) while, 
perhaps, the opposite disease, anorexia, is becoming a more important problem. 

12 Shares of zero responses are: beef, 20.9%; pork, 22.6%; poultry, 10.8%; fish, 8.1%; and eggs, 10.9%.  

13 Due to the heterogeneity of the ‘other food’ category, results for this group are not presented in this paper. 

14 Heteroscedasticity tests are calculated under the hypotheses that total per capita food expenditure, energy 
intake, lipids intake and proteins intakes are the main source of the heteroscedastic problem. 

15 In the case of beef, zero responses could also be explained by subjective factors (appearance, taste...). 
16 Mathematical expressions of these elasticities are presented in the Appendix. 
17 We thank to an anonymous referee for this suggestion.
