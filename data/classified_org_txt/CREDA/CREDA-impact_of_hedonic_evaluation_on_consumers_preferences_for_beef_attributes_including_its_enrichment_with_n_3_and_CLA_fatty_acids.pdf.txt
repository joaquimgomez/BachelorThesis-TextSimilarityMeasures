Abstract 15 
 16 
The impact of hedonic evaluation on the expected consumers‘ preferences towards beef attributes 17 

including its enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFA) was evaluated. Six hundred and 18 

forty seven Spanish consumers were divided into two groups differentiated by the information 19 

received. Consumers assessed five beef attributes (origin, animal diet, amount of visible fat, meat 20 

colour and price) by conducting a discrete choice experiments (DCE) using the Generalized 21 

Multinomial Logit model (G-MNL). Subsequently, after a blind tasting of beef samples, consumers 22 

repeated the DCE. Results showed that the hedonic evaluation had a significant impact on 23 

consumer beef preferences, in particular, for the animal diet attribute. After tasting, the scale 24 

heterogeneity, which is the variation of the degree of randomness in the decision-making process 25 

and hence the degree of individuals‘ certainty, have decreased significantly. Results showed 26 

higher consumers‘ overall acceptability scores for beef enriched with PFA, and the information 27 

offered to consumers had no significant impact on their acceptability scores. 28

1. Introduction 32 

 33 
When health claims are presented on food package, purchase intentions are favourably 34 

influenced and consumers risks perception of certain diseases decrease (Kozup, et al., 2003). 35 

Consumers are more aware of the contribution of food to their health (Siró et al. 2008) and thus, 36 

health concerns are becoming a main determinant factor for food consumption. To meet today's 37 

health and wellness concerns, food/beverage demands has evolved towards new range of 38 

products often related to health-promotion and disease prevention. In United States, health 39 

influenced the food purchase decisions of 64% of consumers in 2013, up from 61% in 2012 40 

(IFIC, 2013). However, consumer perception and purchase behaviour of functional ingredients is 41 

not one-dimensional, and the final food result from a variety of factors such as sensory, 42 

socioeconomic, attitudinal, risk perception, cultural and information issues among others (Hellyer 43 

et al, 2012; Siró et al., 2008; Urala and Lähteenmäki, 2004). 44 

 45 

Cultural and attitudinal factors plays an important role in food choice. Siró et al. (2008) stated 46 

that there is a clear difference between western and eastern valuation of functional food. 47 

Western perception of maintenance of original food characteristics is more important for 48 

Europeans than North Americans. The Mediterranean consumers are the ones more concerned 49 

with the ―natural‖ characteristic of food. Therefore, the balance between the valuation of health 50 

effects/benefits of specific functional ingredients and the preservation of the original food 51 

characteristics are key points for the acceptability of functional food. In this context, Franchi 52 

(2012) mentioned that beliefs and identity are influence preferences by indicating to individuals 53 

what foods are ‗good‘ and ‗right‘. 54 

 55 

Sensory attributes are also decisive factors for acceptance of food especially those dealing with 56 

health claims and well-being enhancement (Verbeke, 2005; Urala and Lähteenmäki, 2003 & 57 

2004). Gabrielyan, et al. (2014) mentioned that the intrinsic cues such as taste are a primary 58 

basis for consumers‘ expectations of quality and decisions about whether to make repeat 59 

purchases of a product. Asioli et al. (2014) found that flavour and odour are the most important 60 

in driving consumers' choice for organic food. Annett et al. (2008) and Hobbs et al. (2006) 61 

verified that health and nutrition information together with sensory evaluation and eating 62 

experience are all relevant for a positive valuation of specific functional food (organic 63 

bread/functional meat). Combris et al. (2009) noticed that personal experience, derived from a 64 

blind tasting, was significantly more important than label information regarding ―appellation of 65 



3 

origin‖ of wines. That is, experience plays a very important role in defining individuals‘ perception 66 

and willingness to pay. Lange et al. (2002) and Noussair et al., (2004) compared hedonic ratings 67 

and experimental auctions to evaluate food preferences, stating that hedonic ratings provided 68 

similar aggregate results. Poole et al. (2006) employed an experimental auction to test fruit 69 

quality perceptions by evaluating consumers‘ willingness to pay (WTP) after three alternative 70 

sensory experiments (visual appearance, touching and peeling, and tasting). The authors 71 

concluded that ―experience‖ modifies product quality perceptions and scoring behaviour, as well 72 

as it is likely to affect repurchase decisions. Lange et al. (1998) compared consumers‘ behaviour 73 

using two scenarios: just packaging exposure and packaging exposure and taste. The authors 74 

reported that tasting had an important role on consumers‘ purchase decisions. Respondents do 75 

consider different food attributes after tasting than before tasting with a modification on their 76 

purchase decisions.  77 

 78 

Many studies have analysed consumers‘ preferences, attitudes and acceptance towards beef 79 

(Carpenter et al., 2001; Resurreccion, 2004; Verbeke et al., 2010; Font-i-Furnols & Guerrero, 80 

2014 among others). However, literature that analyses the impact of hedonic valuation on 81 

consumers‘ purchasing decisions toward new developed meat products is still scarce and 82 

remains untreated for beef enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly in Spain. In this 83 

context, we applied a methodological approach that attempts to mimic consumers‘ behaviour 84 

towards a novel product (enriched beef with beneficial fatty acids), which can be summarized in 85 

3 main subsequent steps:  86 

a) When consumers face a new product on the shelf stores, they generate expectations 87 

(expected or pre-sensory preferences) on the basis of their past experiences and 88 

available information related to the characteristics of the product or to similar products 89 

(Deliza & MacFie, 1996). 90 

b) Tasting the new product (hedonic evaluation test) allow constructing a set of current 91 

experience information that is useful to decide for a repeated choice or not. 92 

c) After tasting the new product, consumers‘ acceptance may result in agreement or 93 

disagreement with what they expected. These changes play an important role in the 94 

acceptance or rejection of the new product (Font-i-Furnols & Guerrero, 2014), and may 95 

affect the final choice of the consumers (final or post-sensory preferences). 96 

 97 

In this context, the main objective of this paper was to analyse the impact of hedonic evaluation, 98 

for both informed and non-informed groups of consumers, on the expected preferences for beef 99

4 

attributes including its enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 and the conjugated 100 

linoleic acid, CLA). The analysis of the hedonic evaluation impact is carried out by comparing the 101 

consumers‘ preferences before and after the tasting experience. In addition, we analysed if the 102 

health information delivered to consumers had influenced the overall acceptability scores for 103 

beef. From one hand, empirically, this is the first paper that analysed the sensory impact on the 104 

expected preferences towards the enriched beef meat with polyunsaturated fatty acid. On the 105 

other hand, methodologically, this paper contribute to the literature of the Discrete Choice 106 

Modelling (DCM) using the recently developed Generalised Multinomial Logit Model (G-MNL) of 107 

Fiebig et al., (2010) allowing for both preference and scale heterogeneity. To our knowledge, 108 

this is the first application, in the literature of food and meat preferences studies that analyse the 109 

impact of sensory experience on consumers‘ preferences using the G-MNL and that analyses 110 

how the scale heterogeneity is affected. 111 

 112 
2. Materials and methods 113 

In accordance to the main objective, our methodological framework consisted of three main 114 

steps:  115 

a) The first part focussed on analysing the expected consumers‘ preferences using discrete 116 

choice experiments (DCE) towards beef meat attributes and its enrichment with n-3 and 117 

CLA (expected or pre-sensory preferences step). In this initial step, consumers were divided 118 

into two groups. While the first one received information about the enrichment process and 119 

the health benefits of CLA and n-3 fatty acids, the second group did not receive any 120 

additional information. 121 

b) The second part was based on a blind tasting of four types of beef samples (conventional, 122 

enriched with n-3, enriched with CLA and enriched with both n-3 and CLA) from animals fed 123 

one of four different diets (hedonic evaluation test step). In this second stage, consumers‘ 124 

overall acceptability was assessed using a 9-point hedonic scale (1 = dislike extremely to 9 125 

= like extremely). After tasting of samples, all consumers were told what type of beef they 126 

have tasted in order to associate their score with the different types of beef meat. 127 

c) In the third phase, we repeated the DCE carried out in the first step in order to analyse the 128 

potential impact of sensory evaluation on the expected consumers‘ preferences for beef 129 

attributes including its enrichment with n-3 and CLA (final or post sensory preferences step). 130 

 131 

A summarized scheme of the methodological framework is presented in Figure 1. As can be 132 

seen, this approach allowed first to analyse the impact of health information on the expected 133 



5 

preferences (point 1) that has been reported by Kallas et al. (2014). It also permitted analysing 134 

the hedonic evaluation regarding beef attributes in particular the n-3 and CLA attributes (point 2) 135 

that has been presented and discussed by Realini et al. (2014). Finally, the hedonic evaluation 136 

impact on the expected preferences of informed and non-informed consumers is assessed in 137 

this study. 138 

 139 

3.1. Theoretical foundation of the Discrete Choice Experiments 140 

The preference analysis is based on the DCE that aims to identify the individual‘s indirect utility 141 

function associated with attributes of products by examining the trade-offs they make when 142 

making choice decisions. Thus, several alternatives that are described by several attributes with 143 

varying levels are presented to respondents in choice sets. The respondent is then asked to select 144 

its preferred alternative within each choice set, thereby revealing his/her preference for certain 145 

attributes and levels. Subsequently, the relative importance of the attributes can be indirectly 146 

recovered from respondents‘ choices. 147 

DCE rely on Lancaster‘s Theory of Value (Lancaster, 1966) which proposes that utility of a product 148 

is decomposed into separable utilities for their characteristics or attributes. It is also based on the 149 

Random Utility Theory (RUT) laid out by Thurstone (1927). This theory propose that subjects 150 

choose among alternatives according to a utility function with two main components: a systematic 151 

(observable) component and a random error term (non-observable): 152 

( , )
jn jn j n jn

U V X S          (1) 153 

where jnU  is the utility of alternative j  to subject n , jnV  is the systematic component of the utility, 154 

j
X  is the vector of attributes of alternative j , nS  is the vector of socio-economic characteristics of 155 

the subject n  and jn  is the random term. 156 

 157 
3.2. Choice Experiments modelling 158 

To predict the subjects‘ preferences for attributes (k), we need to define the ―probability of choice‖ 159 

that an individual n chooses the alternative i rather than the alternative j  (for any i  and j  within 160 

choice sets, T ). McFadden (1974) developed an econometric model that formalized respondents‘ 161 

decision making process. This model is often referred to as the multinomial logit (MNL) model, 162 

which is considered the base model for DCE. According to MNL model the utility to person n from 163 

choosing alternative j on choice scenario t is given by: 164

njt njt njt n

n N j J tU x T            (2) 165 

Where, njtx is a vector of observed attributes of alternative j,   is a vector of mean attribute 166 

utilities (utility weights) and njt is the ―idiosyncratic‖ error term that follows independent and 167 

identically distributed (i.i.d.) Type 1 extreme value distribution with scale parameter 
n

 . 168 

 169 

The probability ( )
j nt

P X  that an individual n will choose alternative j  among other alternative of 170 

an array of choice set T  is formulated as follows: 171

 173 

Where 
nt

X is the vector of attributes of all alternatives 1,  ,   j J  . In the case of estimating a 174 

MNL, the scale parameter 
n

 is normalized to one for identification. 175 

The MNL impose homogeneity in preferences for observed attribute. Thus, only average attributes‘ 176 

utilities are estimated which is often unrealistic as consumers‘ preferences are, by nature, 177 

heterogeneous. Therefore, the mixed or heterogeneous logit models (MIXL) (in the literature is 178 

also referred to as Random Parameter Logit model, RPL) have been introduced to investigate 179 

such heterogeneity. This model extend the MNL allowing for unobserved heterogeneity by 180 

allowing random coefficients on attributes (Ben-Akiva et al., 1997).  181 

In MIXL the utility to person n from choosing alternative j in choice set t is given by:  182

Where, 
n n

     and where ( )
n

 is the vector of person n specific deviations from the mean 184 

value of the  s. The 
n

  is described by an underlying continuous distribution for the attributes 185 

defined by the researcher. In most applications the multivariate normal distribution is the most 186 

used, MVN (0,). In this case, 
n

  is also assumed to be one for identification. This model has 187 

been used in the analysis regarding the information impact on expected preferences (point 1 in 188 

Figure 1). However, Louviere and Mayer (2007) and Louviere et al. (2008) argued that much of 189 

the preference heterogeneity captured by random parameters can be better captured by the scale 190 

term; and thus known as ―scale heterogeneity‖. Therefore, they considered that the MIXL turns to 191 



7 

be likely a poor approximation to stated data if scale heterogeneity is not accounted for (Fiebig, et 192 

al., 2010). 193 

The scale heterogeneity is the variation of the degree of randomness in the decision-making 194 

process over respondents and hence is the degree of individuals‘ certainty. It is based the 195 

differences of the variance of the error term ( )  across individual-decision-makers. In this context, 196 

the analysis of the scale heterogeneity is important, especially for the stated preference studies 197 

(i.e. based on questionnaire). In this context, Feibig et al. (2010) developed the Generalized 198 

Multinomial Logit model (GMNL). Within this approach, the 
n

  is no longer set to be one, and a 199 

particular specification of this term is assumed. Feibig et al. (2010) identified that the utility to 200 

person n from choosing alternative j on choice set t is given by: 201 

[ γ (1 γ) ]
njt n n n n njt njt

U X                 (5) 202 

where γ  is a parameter between 0 and 1. It is a mixing parameter, and its value determines the 203 

level of mixing or interaction between the scale heterogeneity coefficient 
n

  and the parameter 204 

heterogeneity coefficient 
n

 . 
n

  is a scaling factor that proportionately scales the   up or down 205 

for each individual n. Finally, because 
n

  only enters the model as a product of 
n

   (equation 5), 206 

Fiebig et al. (2010) proposed exp( )
n n

     and  is estimated1. 207 

The GMNL model is specified by default to consider the 
n

  as uncorrelated. That is mean the 208 

covariance matrix of 
n

 is constrained to be a diagonal matrix (a matrix in which all values above 209 

and to the right of the diagonal are equal to zero). However, the GMNL can be specified to allow 210 

for correlated parameters. The presence of multiple observations on stated-choice responses for 211 

each sampled individual means that the potential for correlated responses across observations 212 

can be the product of many sources including the sequencing of offered choice situations that 213 

results in mixtures of learning and inertia effects, among other possible influences on choice 214 

response as commented by Hensher et al., (2005). Thus, discrete choice data with a repeated 215 

choice situations containing the same attributes and levels may have unobserved effects that are 216 

correlated among alternatives in a given choice situation. When the random parameter are 217 

correlated the model reports the diagonal value of the Cholesky matrix that represent the true 218 

standard deviation for each random parameter once the cross-correlated parameter terms have 219 

been unconfounded. The below –diagonal elements in Cholesky decomposition matrix are the 220

8 

covariances (cross-correlation) among the random parameter estimates. In this study, we 221 

estimated a correlated random parameter within the G-MNL model due to its best goodness of fit. 222 

For the estimation, we used the GMXLOGIT procedure in NLOGIT 5 with the ―correlated‖ option. 223 

 224 

Once the model is estimated, we calculate the relative importance ( )
k

I  of each attribute. Thus, the 225 

ratio of a particular attribute utility to the sum of all attributes‘ utilities is used to reveal its relative 226 

importance by the following equation (Smith, 2005):  227

attribute (i.e. the most preferred level) and (min )
k

  is the minimum utility (i.e. the least preferred 230 

level). 231 

 232 
3.3. Empirical application 233 

The first step in the application of the DCE is the identification of the attributes that best describe 234 

the product of interest. For this study, on the basis of the literature review presented in Kallas et 235 

al., (2014) and Realini et al., (2014) we defined five attributes: the animal diet with four levels were 236 

evaluated which corresponded to the type of beef assessed in the hedonic evaluation 237 

(conventional, enriched with omega-3, enriched with CLA and enriched with omega-3 plus CLA). 238 

Origin attribute with two levels as ‗locally produced‘ and ‗other Spanish origin‘. Two meat colour 239 

levels were evaluated as ‗pale red‘ or ‗bright red‘, and two fat levels of beef steaks were 240 

considered as ‗moderate visible fat‘ or ‗slight visible fat‘. Finally, beef price was included as 241 

another key attribute with four levels: 6.6 € high, 5.7 € medium–high, 4.8 € medium–low and 3.9 € 242 

low meat price. The second step is to carry out an experimental design that allow for creating the 243 

different situation of choice (choice sets). We followed the Dual Response Choice Experiments 244 

(DRCE) design (Kallas et al., 2012). An orthogonal fractional factorial design was used, obtaining 245 

16 choice sets. Finally, factorial blocking arrangement was carried out obtaining 2 blocks, each 246 

with 8 choice sets presented to individual respondents so that the number of profiles would be low 247 

enough to be easily handled by consumers. 248 

The data were obtained from a sample consisted of two different consumer groups. The first 249 

sample consisted of 322 consumers that did not receive any information about the enriched meat 250 

presented in the choice sets. The second group comprised 325 consumers who received 251 



9 

extensive information about the enrichment process of the beef meat and the advantages of this 252 

product to human health. Regarding the beef sampling procedure for hedonic evaluation, the meat 253 

sample preparation for consumer liking assessment were obtained from forty-eight Holstein entire 254 

males fed with one of four dietary treatments. All animal diets had similar composition but differed 255 

in the content of whole linseed and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): CONV (conventional 256 

commercial ration, 0% linseed and 0% CLA), OME3 (conventional ration enriched with omega-3 257 

fatty acids through the addition of 10% linseed), CLA (conventional ration enriched with CLA 258 

through the addition of 2% CLA), and OME3-CLA (conventional ration enriched with omega-3 and 259 

CLA fatty acids through the addition of 10% linseed plus 2% CLA)

3. Results and discussion 262 

 263 
3.1. Impact of hedonic evaluation on expected preferences 264 

Focusing on how sensory experience from the hedonic evaluation affect the expected 265 

preferences generated for both informed and non-informed consumers, results of the full GMNL 266 

model showed the relative importance of the attributes (Table 1). Regarding the pre sensory test 267 

results, the order of the relative importance of the attributes was slightly different for both groups 268 

of consumers, showing that the information provided had an impact on their expected beef meat 269 

preferences as reported by Kallas et al. (2014). Thus, for non-informed consumers, fat content 270 

was the most important attribute while it was less important for the informed ones. There is a 271 

clear substitution effect between the diet and the fat content showing the significant impact of 272 

information on consumers‘ preferences. It is evident that consumers are less concerned about 273 

the amount of visible fat in beef as long as it is enriched with beneficial fatty acids. 274 

 275 

In this context, diet was not important in the beef purchasing decisions of uninformed consumers 276 

before tasting the product, but it was one of the most important factors for informed consumers 277 

and after the hedonic evaluation. These results show that producing enriched beef meat may 278 

lead consumers to give less importance to its fat content, assuming that the beneficial 279 

compounds (omega-3 and CLA) may counteract the negative effect of the amount of fat. The 280 

improvement of the fatty acid composition of beef through modifications in the animal diet would 281 

provide consumers with a product that is closer to current nutritional recommendations for a 282 

healthy diet, favouring consumers‘ purchasing decisions regarding enriched meat. In addition, 283

 More details about the attributes‘ selection, the experimental design, the procedure of sample selection and the meat 

sample preparation can be found in Kallas et al. (2014) and Realini et al., (2014).

consumers would be less concerned about the amount of fat present in enriched meat, which is 284 

also positively related with the sensory properties of meat. 285 

 286 

Analysing preferences before and after the sensory test within each group, results show 287 

significant modifications in the relative importance of the attributes for the non-informed 288 

consumers, while minor changes occurred for the informed ones in their beef purchasing 289 

preferences. Results showed that after beef tasting, a significant change resulted in the diet 290 

preference which has moved from a non-significant preference to the most important one. In 291 

addition, the relative importance of the fat attribute decreased significantly. 292 

 293 
Results from Table 2 reports the marginal utilities of the attributes, the attribute heterogeneity 294 

terms and the scale parameters
3
. As commented, behaviourally, the advantage of the G-MNL is 295 

that it allows respondents to have different utility function scales that describe a different 296 

uncertainty levels with respect to the choices they make. Focusing on the scale parameters, the 297 

information and the hedonic evaluation have had a significant impact. Results shows that 298 

moving from models for non-informed consumers to informed one, the average error scales 299 

decreased significantly. This may indicate that when the consumers are informed they make 300 

more reliable choices. In addition, for the informed consumers both the γ and the τ parameter 301 

were not significantly different from zero. Thus the unobserved heterogeneity in this case is 302 

better described by the normally distributed deviations from mean coefficients, but there is no 303 

additional value in describing it with a scaling factor. It is also relevant that the hedonic 304 

evaluation for both informed and non-informed consumers showed some evidence of a shift in 305 

the scaling factor across choice (  turns to be insignificant) showing that consumers after 306 

tasting experience tended to be more reliable about their choice exhibiting non-significant scale 307 

heterogeneity. 308 

 309 

Focusing on each attributes levels, results show those preferences for informed and non-informed 310 

consumers before and after tasting beef samples from animals fed different diets intended to 311 

improve the fatty acid profile of meat. To better understand the attribute preferences, the utilities of 312 

the different levels of each attribute from the GMNL estimation were obtained. Utilities for the 313 

amount of visible fat were higher for the uninformed consumers, which indicates that consumers 314 

that do not receive information about the benefits of omega-3 and CLA fatty acids or their role in 315 

human health are more concerned about the amount of fat in meat. There is a reduction in the 316

utilities for the fat attribute after tasting for non-informed consumers since the relative importance 317 

of this attribute decreases. After the blind tasting of the different beef samples, consumers were 318 

told about the type of beef that they have tasted. Thus, for the non-informed consumers the 319 

relative importance of other attributes and their utilities such as the animal diet increased 320 

significantly compared with the fat content which decreased. Enriched beef had similar or slightly 321 

higher hedonic scores compared with conventional beef (Table 2). Many authors indicated that 322 

consumers are not willing to compromise on taste of functional foods for eventual health benefits 323 

(Augustin, 2001; Cox, Koster & Russell, 2004; Gilbert, 2000; Verbeke, 2006). Results from this 324 

study indicate that consumers may be less concerned about the amount of fat in meat, if they 325 

become aware that sensory properties are not compromised when meat is enriched with beneficial 326 

fatty acids. 327 

 328 

Regarding the levels of meat colour and origin, results show a convergence of preferences for 329 

both types of consumers. Moreover, the sensory test had no impact on consumer preferences 330 

maintaining the order of the preferred colour (bright red) and the preferred origin (locally produced). 331 

For the diet attribute, the utility for the enriched meat with omega-3 increased and the preference 332 

for the conventional one decreased for both groups of consumers, but especially for non-informed 333 

consumers. However, there is a consensus to reject the CLA enriched beef for expected 334 

preference before tasting and that obtained after the sensory analysis. Consumer preferences 335 

regarding the diet attribute may be explained by the fact that most consumers are familiar with 336 

omega-3 fatty acids and with some commercial products enriched with these fatty acids, in 337 

contrast to CLA and the enrichment of food products with CLA. Siró et al. (2008) also indicated 338 

that well-known compounds are more accepted than less-known components in food products. 339 

 340 

Finally, after the tasting experience, there is a reduction of the utility associated with the higher 341 

and average prices and a slight increase with the lower price for informed consumers. Focusing 342 

on the lower price level, informed consumers showed the highest utility increase. This may 343 

indicate that the sensory experience of the enriched meat was not enough to justify per se that the 344 

price of the meat have to be more expensive as a results of the enrichment. Regarding the opt-out 345 

option, results show that the utility associated with it was not significant for informed consumers, 346 

showing that more consumers did not select the opt out option in comparison to the non-informed 347 

one. In this later case, the utility of the opt-out was positive and significant which is an indicator 348 

that without information some products do not convince consumers, mainly the enriched with CLA 349 

and those with high prices.  350

3.2. Impact of information on consumers’ beef acceptability 351 

Overall acceptability scores for beef from animals fed the different diets is shown in Table 3. 352 

Comparing the overall acceptability of the four types of beef meat, results show a non-significant 353 

impact of the information at 95%. This indicates that the information provided to one group of 354 

consumers about the benefits of omega-3 and CLA fatty acids did not have an influence on their 355 

hedonic preferences for beef. In contrasts to our results, Morales et al. (2013) showed that 356 

information about beef production systems generated positive expectations and increased 357 

acceptability ratings for beef from grazing animals. This may indicate that the impact of 358 

information on hedonic preferences by consumers may depend on the type of information 359 

provided. Since there were no differences in our study in hedonic scores depending on 360 

information, we will focus on the values obtained for the whole sample (all consumers) for the 361 

interpretation of the sensory scores. Results showed that enriched beef with omega-3 fatty acids 362 

had higher acceptability scores than beef from the other treatments. Beef enriched with CLA had 363 

similar acceptability scores to beef enriched with both omega-3 and CLA which in turn was 364 

similar to conventional beef. It should be noted, however, that the differences among 365 

acceptability scores are within 0.5 in a 9 point scale using a high number of consumers (n=642). 366 

Results indicate that differences in beef acceptability among dietary treatments, although 367 

statistically significant, are not large. 368 

 369 

4. Conclusion 370 

Results showed that hedonic evaluation had a significant impact on defining consumer beef 371 

preferences, especially for non-informed consumers, and thus, their expected preferences were 372 

affected by the sensory evaluation. Focusing on the animal diet attribute, utilities for n-3 373 

enriched beef increased significantly after tasting, particularly for non-informed consumers, while 374 

utilities for CLA enriched beef were still not significant after tasting for all consumers. In this 375 

context, after the hedonic evaluation, there was a positive disagreement between the expected 376 

preference for n-3 enriched meat and the final preference. Provided information about the 377 

enrichment process and the health benefits of n-3 and CLA fatty acids had no significant impact 378 

on overall acceptability scores of beef. 379 

 380 

After the hedonic valuation results showed that the unobserved heterogeneity is better described 381 

by the normally distributed deviations from mean coefficients and there is no additional value in 382 

describing it with a scaling factor. Thus, the beef tasting exhibit for both informed and non-383 

informed consumers evidence of a shift in the scaling factor across choice. Comparing 384 



13 

preferences before and after beef tasting results also shows significant changes in the relative 385 

importance of some attributes. In this sense, the heterogeneous scale identified before the 386 

sensory test tended to be more homogeneous after tasting. The GMN-L model was first 387 

estimated with uncorrelated coefficients. Compared to this, the correlated version provide a 388 

better fit to the data. Beside preference heterogeneity, we also find statistically significant scale 389 

heterogeneity; therefore the assumption of identical scales across individuals is rejected. Results 390 

also showed that the full version of the GMN-L (including correlation between random parameter 391 

and between taste and scale preferences) had the best goodness of fit (AIC, Pseudo R
2
). 392 

Analysing the attributes non-attendance before and after sensory are proposed for further 393 

research. 394
