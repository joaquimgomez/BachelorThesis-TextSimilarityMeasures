I. INTRODUCTION 

 

Until recently, the design of domestic agricultural policies in developed countries 

has given priority to methods that guarantee a price floor for agricultural 

commodities. Price support mechanisms can range from supply restrictions 

imposed on the domestic market, price subsidies, or public purchases of 

agricultural commodities to offset excess supply. A wide literature has shown 

that price support mechanisms may intensify production practices and bring 

about significant deadweight losses (Gardner, 1992). The unfavourable 

consequences of agricultural protectionism became widely recognized by the 

1980s. It became clear that agricultural intervention based on price guarantees 

and other market insulating policies led to overproduction, which in turn brought 

about market distortions and disagreements in multilateral trade policy 

negotiations. Recognition of these problems motivated multilateral and/or 

bilateral trade agreements that advocated for agricultural protectionism 

dismantling processes. In the framework of these agreements, different countries 

have reformed their domestic agricultural policies. Economic theory views lump 

sum transfers as the most efficient method to redistribute income among 

individuals (Williamson, 1996). The trade-off between political pressures for 

continued support to farmers and the policymakers’ will to reduce efficiency 

losses resulted in an increased use of decoupled agricultural policies. Decoupling 

is a term used to designate the break of the link between subsidies and 

production. Price supports are usually replaced by lump sum income transfers 

that do not depend on actual production or prices.  



 2 

The conventional approach to the analysis of the effects of agricultural 

policies on farmers’ profit maximization decisions has been to assume perfect 

markets (including credit markets), risk neutral producers and constant returns to 

scale. Under these assumptions, the literature has shown that the impacts of 

decoupled policies on production decisions are limited. However, if economic 

agents are not risk neutral, markets are imperfect, or returns to scale are other 

than constant, apparently decoupled payments could have more implications (see 

Phimister, 1995; Hennessy, 1998; or Rude, 2001). A number of studies that have 

assessed economic agents’ risk preferences have found evidence in favour of risk 

aversion (see, for example, Hansen and Singleton, 1983; Chavas and Pope, 1985; 

Pope and Just, 1991). If uncertainty and risk preferences are introduced in the 

analysis of the impacts of decoupling, results suggest that apparently decoupled 

policies can influence production decisions (Hennessy, 1998; Sandmo, 1971). It 

is thus very important to account for risk and risk preferences when assessing the 

effects of decoupling.  

When coupled or partially coupled, income supports often involve 

restrictive supply management rules that limit farmers’ capacity to respond to 

market conditions. For example, eligibility for public subsidies is usually made 

conditional upon producing specific crops, the program crops. In this regard, 

decoupling involves increased planting flexibility in that direct payments are not 

tied to the production of certain commodities. Farmers being allowed more 

planting flexibility are likely to be more responsive to market conditions and 

alter their crop mix accordingly. To the extent that planting flexibility includes 

the possibility of agricultural land idling, farmers will also consider setting land 

aside when taking their decisions on land allocation.  



 3 

There are yet other mechanisms through which the decoupling of 

agricultural policies can influence land allocation decisions. These mechanisms 

are the changes in relative market prices and farmers’ risk attitudes. The 

reduction in price supports is likely to make program crops less attractive relative 

to non-program commodities and land idling. Also, to the extent that farmers’ 

risk preferences are influenced by wealth (Sandmo, 1971; Just and Pope, 1978; 

Hennessy, 1998; Just and Zilberman, 1986) and to the extent that decoupled 

payments and price changes have the potential to affect the wealth of participant 

farmers, their willingness to assume risk may be altered. Because risk is a 

fundamental component of agricultural production and because yield variability 

can differ by crop type, government transfers might affect farms’ land use by 

means of altering farmers’ risk attitudes.   

Decoupled agricultural payments were introduced in the United States 

(US) with the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act, 

which involved a substantial change in the way income support was provided to 

farmers. With the FAIR Act, market price supports and deficiency payments 

were being partially replaced by Production Flexibility Contract (PFC) Payments 

whose amount and entitlement would not depend on actual production or prices, 

and a deficiency payment program that guaranteed a minimum support price for 

program crops including soybeans. While under the 1990 Act and with the 

exception of the flex acres, producers were required to plant the base acreage to 

the base crop in order to be eligible for deficiency payments, entitlement to 

receive PFC was based on qualified acres historically enrolled in commodity 

programs, allowing land to be put to any agricultural use, including the 



 4 

production of any crop with the exception of fruits and vegetables (unless it was 

used in this way in the past), or idled.   

The purpose of this article is to study the impacts of decoupling on land 

allocation decisions. Our analysis contributes to the literature by formally 

assessing the effects of decoupling on farms’ crop mix and on the decision to set 

land aside. The analysis is undertaken within the framework of the model of 

production under uncertainty developed by Just and Zilberman (1986). We 

extend this model to study supply responses to decoupled payments and to 

include set aside among land use alternatives. Though various analyses have 

addressed the effects of decoupling on producers’ decisions, no existing research 

has studied the impacts of decoupled payments on farms’ land allocation using 

the extended Just and Zilberman (1986) model. Our empirical application 

focuses on a sample of Kansas farms observed from 1998 to 2001. Results 

suggest that US agricultural policy decoupling could have involved a shift in land 

use away from program crops towards non-program commodities offering higher 

expected profits and idle land.  

 

 

II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 

 

The objective of our model is to assess the effects of decoupling on farm land 

allocation. We adopt Just and Zilberman (1986) model of production under 

uncertainty. Because agricultural producers are not likely to be neutral to risk, 

farmers’ risk preferences are explicitly considered. Our model defines risk 

preferences as a function of wealth (Just and Zilberman, 1986; Pope and Just, 



 5 

1991; Hennessy, 1998). If economic agents are risk averse and their risk 

adversity decreases with wealth (Pope and Just, 1991; Bar-Shira, Just and 

Zilberman, 1997), an increase in decoupled payments is expected to alter the 

crop mix towards more risky crops that offer higher expected margins. The 

reduction in price supports for program crops that characterizes a decoupling 

process will reduce the attractiveness of these crops in favour of non-program 

commodities and/or idle land. Apart from the substitution effects, a change in 

output prices will also have an income effect that, under the assumption of 

decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) preferences, is likely to increase risk 

adversity. 

The 1996 FAIR Act involved the introduction of decoupled payments that 

allowed, with some restrictions, full planting flexibility. We extend Just and 

Zilberman (1986) model to allow for these payments and the possibility to 

receive them even if agricultural land is left idle. Our model offers an improved 

picture of farmers’ behaviour by allowing to optimize land allocation in response 

to policy. We model PFC payments as simple lump sum transfers, thus 

recognizing that under the new scenario farmers will manage their crop mix in 

accordance with market conditions.  

 Consider a firm that produces two outputs, crop 1 and crop 2. Crop 1 

represents a program crop in that eligibility for government payments under the 

old policy regime required crop acres be planted to this crop. Crop 2 is a non-

program crop. Yields per acre are defined as uncertain variables and expressed as 

1 2( , )y y=Y . For simplicity, it is assumed that producer uncertainty derives only 

from production, but not from market conditions. If additive production risk is 

assumed, the production function of crop i  can be expressed as ( )i i i iy y x ε= + , 



 6 

where ix  is the per acre quantity of a variable input x  allocated to the production 

of crop i , and iε  is a stochastic error term with mean [ ] 0iE ε =  and variance 

[ ] 2var i iε σ= . The first two moments of the joint distribution of yields are

payments.  The quasi rent associated to idle land is assumed to be equal to zero. 

Following previous literature, we assume risk neutrality in the input decision2 

which leads to independence of land allocation from variable input decisions 

(Just and Zilberman, 1986). Under this assumption the first order conditions of 

the land allocation problem can be expressed as:

expansion, the first order conditions can be alternatively expressed as:

2 As Just and Zilberman note, the assumption of risk neutrality is very common in models with 

stochastic production and is necessary for the dual cost and production functions to be 

independent of risk preferences. This assumption allows to derive a theoretical framework that is 

more tractable at the empirical level.

it does not restrict the specific type of farmers’ risk preferences. Risk adverse

Shira, Just and Zilberman, 1997; Isik and Khanna, 2003) we assume here that

Finally, 23 2ϖ= −v  corresponds to the negative value of the variance of non-

equalization of the marginal mean income effect derived from an increase in land 

allocated to crop i  and the marginal risk effect discounted to a certainty 

equivalent by using the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion. 



 9 

 In order to determine the effects of decoupling on land allocation 

decisions, we use comparative statics. The consideration of a multi-product land 

allocation problem involves substantial complexity relative to a more simplified 

two-product model and yields comparative statics formulae that cannot be 

signed. In order to make comparative statics more simple, but also more clear, 

we simplify the model to a consideration of only two alternatives in the land 

allocation problem: 1L  and iL , 2,3i = .
3 It is important to note that model 

simplification is only limited to the comparative statics analysis in this section, 

and that the empirical implementation will be based upon the generalized three-

product model.  

 Let’s consider a land allocation problem that only includes program and 

non-program commodities. In such scenario the system of first-order conditions 

is reduced to:

explained above, in a decoupling process lump sum payments are usually 

introduced to replace price supports. Our comparative statics analysis thus 

focuses on determining the sensitivity of the crop mix to changes to program 

                                                 
3 Note that this simplification is economically reasonable as it represents two possible corner 

solutions that can apply to our problem, i.e. that farmers decide not to set land aside or diversify 

the crop mix.

crop prices and to lump sum payments. The comparative statics results can be 

summarized in the following propositions (proofs are presented in the appendix).  

 

PROPOSITION1. Land allocated to the program crop ( = 1i ) increases with an

with an increase in G  if 2

−∞ < <  and 1 1 2ν ν<L . 

  

Proposition 1 can be economically interpreted as follows. An increase in 

decoupled payments improves farmers’ wealth which in turn increases their 

willingness to assume more risk. This could reduce the attractiveness of crop mix 

diversification as a strategy to manage farm income risk. This will only be 

pursued if yields correlation is negative or takes low positive values, and if an 

increase in program crop production would substantially reduce the profit ( TΠ ) 

variance. Otherwise diversification will not be pursued. 

 

PROPOSITION 2. For a negative value of the mean effect of production, land 

allocated to the program crop decreases with an increase in 1p  if 0ρ <  and

land allocated to crop 1 only decreases if the mean effect outweighs the risk 

effect. 

 



 11 

The economic meaning of proposition 2 can be expressed as follows. If the 

expected mean effect of production is negative, an increase in 1p  only motivates 

an increase in 1L  if this increase involves some gains in terms of risk 

management that outweigh the negative mean effect. If yields are negatively 

correlated, the gains in terms of risk management require a substantial reduction 

in the marginal variance of profit. However, if yields are highly and positively 

correlated (and thus diversification towards 2L  is less attractive) a small increase 

in the marginal variance is tolerated, as long as the risk effect is of bigger 

magnitude than the mean effect. 

 

PROPOSITION 3. For a positive value of the mean effect of production, land 

allocated to the program crop increases with an increase in 1p  if 0ρ <  and 

1 2

crop1 only increases if the mean effect outweighs the risk effect. 

 

Proposition 3 thus shows that, being the expected mean effect positive, no 

diversification in favour of non-program crops is pursued if yields correlation is 

high and positive. However, if 0ρ <  an increase in 1L   requires an important 

reduction in the marginal variance of profit. 

In order to assess the effects of decoupling on idle land, we now consider 

a model that studies the allocation of land among program crop production and 

set aside. In such a situation, the first order condition in (3) changes to (4) below:

 (4) 

 

Comparative statics allow to formulate the following two propositions: 

 

PROPOSITION4. Idle land is reduced with an increase in decoupled payments. 

 

This is due to the fact that an increase in decoupled payments reduces farmers’ 

degree of risk aversion increasing their willingness to assume more risk. Given 

that idle land involves no risk, this alternative becomes less attractive in favour 

of producing agricultural commodities.  

 

PROPOSITION5. For a negative value of the mean effect of production, idle 

land increases with an increase in 1p  to the detriment of 1L . However, if the 

mean effect of production is positive, idle land only increases if the risk effect 

outweighs the mean effect.  

 

In a situation where the mean effect of production is positive, farmers have the 

incentive to increase the amount of land allocated to program crops to the 

detriment of idle land, as long as the increase in production risk discounted to a 

certainty equivalent does not outweigh the mean effect. However, if the mean 

effect is negative, an increase in 1p  reduces program crop land in favour of idle 

land. 

 In summary, our comparative statics analysis shows that decoupled 

payments have the effect of reducing idle land. In contrast, the reduction in 



 13 

program crop price supports can motivate land set aside. Decoupled payments 

can also stimulate a change in crop mix in favour of non-program commodities. 

This shift requires yields correlation to be negative or take low positive values. A 

decrease in program crop price supports can also boost non-program crops 

acreage under certain conditions. It is relevant to note that, with the exception of 

the influence of decoupled payments on idle land, the net effects of decoupling 

depend on issues such as yields correlation, changes in the variance of profit, or 

the magnitude of the  mean and risk production effects. This impedes to 

anticipate the response to a decoupled program making it necessary to determine 

it empirically.  

 

 

III. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION 

 

As explained above, our empirical application is focused on the analysis of the 

effects of the US agricultural policy reforms in 1996 on land allocation decisions 

taken by a sample of Kansas farms. Specifically, we are interested in observing 

how the planting flexibility provisions and the decoupling of farm income 

support influenced Kansas farms’ land use.  

 Farm-level data are taken from farm account records from the Kansas 

Farm Management Association database for the period 1998 to 2001. 

Retrospective data for these farms are also used to define some lagged variables 

used in the application.4 The Kansas Farm Management Association database 

collects information from individual farms on an annual basis through a 

                                                 
4 To be able to do so, a complete panel of data is built out of our sample. 



 14 

cooperative record-sharing, farm management, and tax preparation arrangement. 

Around 2,500 full-time commercial holdings with gross sales exceeding 

$100,000 provide data to this database. Various farm types and areas in Kansas 

are represented in the dataset (Albright, 2001). The variables in the database 

include, among other information, farm financial and production data, balance 

sheet, cash flow and income statements. Our analysis is based on farm-level data, 

but aggregates are also used to define important variables that are unavailable in 

the farm-level dataset. These aggregates are taken from the United States 

Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the National Agricultural Statistics 

Service (NASS). USDA provided state-level PFC payment rates and NASS 

facilitated country-level price indices and state-level output prices and quantities.  

 Table 1 contains summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis. 

Following our model specification, we consider a variable input x  that includes 

the application of herbicides and fertilizer, representing the main variable costs 

for the farms in the sample. Because input prices are not available from the 

Kansas database, we define w  as a country-level input price index. An implicit 

quantity index for variable inputs is derived through the ratio of input use in 

currency units to the corresponding price index. The Kansas dataset does not 

provide information on the consumption of variable inputs by crop. We use Just 

et al. (1990) behavioural proposal to allocate variable input use among different 

crops.5 

                                                 
5 We should note here that another allocation mechanism based on profit maximization was also 

used, but yielded inconsistent results. This is not surprising in light of Just et al. (1990) findings 

that the behavioural method is superior.  



 15 

 Two output categories are distinguished as quantity indices per acre ( 1y  

and 2y ). Variable 1y  represents program crops and includes the production of 

wheat, corn, and grain sorghum per acre. Variable 2y  is the production of 

soybeans representing a non-program commodity. Together, wheat, corn, 

sorghum and soybeans represent the main crops in Kansas. Paasche indices for 

both crops are computed using state-level output prices and production to define 

1p  and 2p .  

 iA  represents land allocated to alternative 1,2i = ,3, being A  the variable 

representing total crop acres, 3A  the acres left idle, and 1A  and 2A  the crop acres 

planted to program and non-program crops respectively. By using iy , ix , ip , w , 

the value for iΠ  can be determined. Computing quasi rents at the farm-level 

involves some problems. First, not every farm produces crop i 6 every year and 

when this happens iΠ  cannot be determined at the farm-level. Second, the 

composition of 1y  can vary annually within a farm as the hectares planted to 

wheat, corn and sorghum change, which complicates the definition of a 

reasonable value for 1Π  at the farm-level. In light of these problems, we define 

quasi rents using annual sample-means for the production and input consumption 

variables.7  

                                                 
6 The problem applies to crop 2i = . 

7 It is important to note here that other alternatives were also considered, including the use of 

farm-level iΠ  values whenever possible (and averages otherwise), or the use of the Kansas 

Farm Management Association crop budgets (http://www.agmanager.info/crops/). However, 

these alternatives yielded results in contrast to widely accepted previous research results and thus 

were discarded. 



 16 

 Kansas database does not register PFC government payments. Instead, a 

single measure including all government payments received by each farm is 

available. To derive an estimate of farm-level PFC payments, the acreage of 

program crops (base acreage) and the base yield for each crop are approximated 

using farm-level data. The approximation uses the 1986-88 average acreage and 

yield for each program crop and farm. PFC payments per crop are derived by 

multiplying 0.85 by the base acreage, yield and the PFC payment rate. PFC 

payments per crop are then added to get total direct payments per farm.8 A 

farm’s initial wealth is defined as the farm’s net worth. 

 

 

IV. RESULTS 

 

Table 1 shows that, during the period studied, more than 62% of crop land was 

planted to program crops, a 26% was devoted to non-program commodities, 

being the rest left idle. Sample means also show that estimated PFC payments 

represent around 1.8% of farmers’ initial wealth. Of interest is the fact that, for 

the period of analysis, the expected profit per acre derived from non-program 

commodities outweighs the one obtained by planting program crops.  Also, 

during the period of study, 2 1var var( ) ( )Π > Π , which involves higher income risk

8 This estimate is compared to actual government payments received by each farm. If estimated 

PFC payments exceed actual payments, the first measure is replaced by the second.  

9 Differences in the variance of profits might partly reflect the fact that while 1y  is a composite 

output, 2y  represents a single crop.

estimates for the first-order conditions of the land allocation decision (see table 

2) provide evidence that farmers in our sample are risk averse, and that the 

degree of risk aversion decreases with farmers’ wealth, i.e., farmers exhibit 

DARA preferences. Price, cross-price and payment elasticities of the proportion 

of land planted to program and non-program crops or left idle are presented in 

table 3. As expected, results suggest that an increase in its own price will 

generate an increase in the quantity of land planted to program crops. Quite the 

opposite, the price elasticity of non-program crops is negative. This result is not 

surprising given the high income risk associated to 2y  during the period of 

analysis. An increase in 2p  does not only involve an increase in mean income, 

but also a substantial increase in income variance. This lays out the necessary 

conditions for a failure in the ‘law of supply’, that contends that the quantity 

supplied by price-taking producers will rise in response to an increase in output 

prices. An increase in profit risk above the increase in its mean will originate this 

failure. This result is in accord with the findings of Just and Zilberman (1986). 

Results indicate that cross-price effects are negative for program crop and 

positive for non-program crop prices. Hence, a decline in program crop market 

prices ( 1p ) as a result of a decrease in price supports, will motivate a change in 

land use away from program crops in favour of non-program commodities. In 

contrast, farmers will respond to an increase in non-program crop prices by 

increasing land devoted to other uses such as program crops. The response of idle 

land to changes to market prices is quite different depending on whether it is the 

program or the non-program crop price that is shocked. An increase in program 

crop prices creates a strong incentive to reduce idle land to plant program 



 18 

commodities.10 This shift in land use takes place because the increase in mean 

income originated by the increase in 1p  outweighs the increase in income risk. 

However, an increase in 2p  does not reduce idle land. Instead idle acreage is 

increased. As noted before, the high risk associated to the production of 2y  for 

the period studied is increased with an increase in the output price. The relevance 

of the risk effect relative to the mean effect motivates farmers to set some land 

aside as a form of self-insurance. Land use is also sensitive to government 

subsidies. An increase in decoupled payments reduces farmers’ degree of risk 

aversion and stimulates undertaking risky activities. This involves a reduction in 

idle land in favour of crop land planted to both program and non-program 

commodities.  

 Hence, our results show that agricultural policy decoupling is likely to 

have motivated a change in farmers’ crop mix. The extremely low values of 

subsidy elasticities relative to price elasticities allow to predict a reduction in the 

acreage planted to program crops in favour of non-program commodities and idle 

land.  

 

 

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

 

This paper investigates the effects of decoupling on farmers’ land allocation 

decisions and, specifically, on the crop mix and idle land. Coupled policies 

usually restrict farmers’ capacity to respond to market conditions by imposing 

restrictive supply management rules. In this regard, decoupling involves 

                                                 
10 High idle land elasticities are partly due to the low initial values of this variable. 



 19 

increased planting flexibility and thus may motivate changes in land allocation. 

Other aspects of decoupling can also influence land allocation decisions. These 

aspects are the reduction in price supports for program crops and their 

replacement by lump sum transfers, which are likely to involve changes in 

relative market prices and in farmers’ risk attitudes. 

 In order to show how these policy reforms could affect land use, we use 

an extended version of the Just and Zilberman (1986) model of production under 

uncertainty. Our model offers an improved picture of farmers’ behaviour by 

allowing to optimize land allocation in response to policy and by considering 

land idling among land use alternatives. Theoretical results show that, under the 

assumption of DARA preferences, an increase in lump sum transfers will 

increase farmers’ willingness to assume more risk. This could reduce the 

attractiveness of crop mix diversification away from program crops and in favour 

of non-program commodities as a strategy to manage farm income risk. This 

involves that this diversification will only be pursued if yields correlation 

between program and non-program crops is negative or takes low positive 

values, and if an increase in land allocated to program crops involves a 

substantial reduction in the profit variance. Under certain conditions of yields 

correlation, profit variance and mean income, a decrease in program crop price 

supports will motivate diversification away from these crops. Idle land will 

decrease as a result of a reduction in program crop prices, only if the mean effect 

of production is negative or if it is positive and the risk effect outweighs the 

mean effect. An increase in decoupled subsidies will motivate farmers to assume 

riskier enterprises and reduce uncultivated land.  



 20 

 We use farm-level data collected in Kansas to illustrate our model and 

determine the effects of the FAIR Act on crop mix diversification. Our results 

show that decoupling could have induced a change in farmers’ crop mix by 

stimulating to reduce program crop acres in favour of non-program commodities 

and land idling.
