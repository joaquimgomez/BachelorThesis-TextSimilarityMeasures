ASYMETRIC PRICE TRANSMISSION IN THE SPANISH LAMB 
SECTOR 

 

Abstract 
This paper aims to investigate the non-linear adjustments of prices between farm and retail prices 

in the lamb sector in Spain. The methodology used is based on the multivariate approach to specify 
and estimate a three-regime Threshold Autoregressive Model. Results indicate that in the long-run 
price transmission is perfect and any supply or demand shocks are fully transmitted along the 
marketing chain. In the short-run, price adjustments between the farm and the retail levels are 
asymmetric and are representative of a demand-pull transmission mechanism. On the other hand, 
retailers benefit from any shock, whether positive or negative, that affects supply or demand 
conditions.  

Key words: Asymmetries, lamb, Spain, price transmission 

 

 

1. Introduction 

The issue of price transmission in a vertical sector has been the subject of much research. 
Particularly, the asymmetric price adjustments have been one of the main research interests among 
agricultural economists. While asymmetric price responses do not necessarily emanate from market 
inefficiencies, evidence of symmetric, rapid price responses is clear evidence of an efficient market. It 
is a common feeling that retail prices do not react very quickly to changes in market conditions. A 
good example could be the situations where retail prices remain sticky in spite of decreases of input 
prices due to primary production increases (Borenstein et al., 1997; Peltzman, 2000). In this situation 
the retail price will not be equal to the marketing clearing price, generating excess supply and 
consumers will not benefit for declining farm prices suggesting a redistribution of consumer welfare. 

As the standard theory of markets has the general implication of symmetric price adjustment, the 
knowledge regarding price asymmetry has come mainly from the accumulation of empirical results. 
Different potential explanations have been given for the existence of asymmetries in price 
adjustments: the market power at the retail level1, adjustment costs at the retail level, input substitution 
at the processing level, stocks at both the production and retail level, production lags at the processing 
level and public intervention. However, only in a few cases (Peltzman, 2000) there has been an 
attempt to link asymmetries with any of the mentioned potential explanations. In any case, before 
explanations can be given for specific markets, the first step is to analyse the existence of such 
asymmetric price adjustments. 

The standard approach to test for asymmetries in price transmission relies on variations of a 
model first developed by Wolffram (1971) and later modified by Houck (1977) and Ward (1982). 
Recent developments in time series analyses have modified the methodological framework to tackle 
with this issue. Von Cramon-Taubadel (1998) showed that the traditional approach was inconsistent 

                                                 

1 Although asymmetries have been linked to non-competitive behaviour, this is not necessarily true. McCorriston 
et al. (2001), with formal grounding in rational firm conduct, showed that in presence of market power price 
changes could be greater or less than the competitive benchmark case depending on the interaction between such 
market power and returns to scale. If the industry cost function is characterised by decreasing returns to scale the 
damping effect of market power is reinforced. On the other hand, if the cost function is characterised by 
increasing returns to scale the market power effect is offset.

with cointegration among prices, specifying a linear Error Correction Model. However, the existence 
of transaction costs may generate non linear price adjustments, making threshold models more suitable 
to analyse asymmetries in price transmission (Azzam, 1999).  

In this paper we investigate, using time series data, the existing asymmetries in the price 
transmission mechanism between farm and retail marketing channels in the Spanish lamb markets. 
Particularly, we will focus our study to answering the question of whether Spanish lamb farmers 
benefit or not from unanticipated positive and negative supply or demand shocks. By using time series 
observations we will be able to study the inevitable dynamic aspects of price transmission along the 
Spanish lamb sector. A Threshold Vector Error-Correction Model (TVECM) will be specified and 
non-linear impulse response functions will be calculated to tackle with this issue. Finally, results will 
be discussed taking into account the specific characteristics of the Spanish lamb sector.  

Spain is the second largest lamb producer within the European Union (EU) just behind the United 
Kingdom. It represents around 5% of the Spanish Final Agricultural production and 11% of Final 
Livestock Production. Although the Common Market Organisation has a set of operating rules which 
may influence the movement of sheep on to or off a holding they do not place any physical constraints 
on producers adapting production to meet consumer needs, etc.  However, the way in which the 
calculation of the premium is made has the potential to dissuade those flocks which produce less lamb 
per ewe then the average from responding to market signals as they have the real potential to achieve a 
lower income, even at higher prices per lamb, because of the potential for the premium payment to 
decline as market prices improve.  Although producers are unlikely to deliberately sell product at low 
prices they will not make a significant effort to change their system to capitalise on higher market 
prices for different qualities of product or at different times of year. Conversely however, because the 
premium is equal for all ewes, individual producers who achieve better than average market prices 
through improved quality or other market initiatives and who produce more lamb per ewe than the 
standard will potentially achieve higher margins. Consequently farmer prices are not primarily 
determined by the ewe premium and producers have incentives to adapt to changing market 
conditions. 

To achieve the above-mentioned objective, the rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 
provides a description of the methodological approach used in the paper. Section 3 reports our 
empirical results. Finally, section 4 closes the paper with some concluding remarks. 

 

2. Modeling nonlinear adjustments 

Several studies attempting to measure asymmetric price transmission focused of the estimation of 
the following model (which constitutes a variation of the econometric specification introduced by 
Wolffram (1971) and redefined by Houck (1977) and Ward (1982)):

where  and  represent changes in retail and wholesale prices, respectively, and It1p∆ t2p∆ t is an 
indicator function that is equal to one if 0p 1t2 ≤∆ −  and zero in other case. This model allows us to 
test if the response of retail prices differs depending on whether wholesale prices increase or decrease 
(see, for example, Hahn (1990), Kinnucan and Forker (1987) and Bailey and Brorsen (1989)).  

However, results from the empirical models used by the above authors to investigate asymmetries 
in price transmission have been criticised for the following reasons: i) this specification assumes that 
the causality goes from wholesale to retail prices only; ii) this model has been used without adequately 
analysing the time series properties of data. Price levels often exhibit a non-stationary covariance 
property which, as a consequence, may bias causality tests and lead to autocorrelation problems in the 
asymmetric price response function (Boyd and Brorsen, 1988, and Kinnucan an Forker, 1987). On the 
other hand, if the price series are cointegrated, the specification of a model in first differences is biased

as a result of the misspecification of the long-run relationships between prices. Von Cramon-Taubadel 
(1998) showed that the traditional econometric specification used to test for asymmetric price 
transmission is inconsistent with cointegration. He proposed an alternative specification of the 
Wolffram-Houck model based on the error correction representation, and taking into account the 
procedure approach suggested by Granger and Lee (1989).  Balke et al. (1998) and Frost and Bowden 
(1999) also use an error correction model to test for asymmetric adjustment. However, these 
applications are based on linear error correction models. The presence of fixed costs of adjustment 
along the food chain may generate non-linear reactions; that is to say, price adjustments may be 
different depending both on the magnitude and the sign of the initial shock. In other words, it is not 
unrealistic to suppose that only when the initial shock surpasses the critical threshold do economic 
agents react to it. Balke and Fomby (1997) present a model that allows for non-linear adjustment to the 
long run equilibrium by introducing the concept of threshold cointegration.  

In this context, two different methodological approaches have been developed. The first one is 
based on an univariate version of the bivariate threshold cointegration models described by Balke and 
Fomby (1997), Enders and Granger (1998) and Enders and Siklos (2001). In a similar way to the two-
step Engle and Granger cointegration approach, this univariate procedure analyses the threshold 
behaviour of the univariate cointegrating residual implied by the prices spread, equal to log price 
difference. It assumes that one of the two prices is exogenous and that only the adjustments to the 
equilibrium change with regimes, while the autoregressive parameters of the model remain constant. 

The second approach to test for threshold cointegration has been suggested by Hansen and Seo 
(2002) and Lo and Zivot (2001). As in Balky-Fomby (1997), the analysis of threshold behaviour is 
based on a bivariate Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) with one cointegrating vector. Hansen 
and Seo (2002) and Lo and Zivot (2001) indicate that the analysis of threshold behaviour in the 
bivariate model allows us to uncover potential nonlinearities and asymmetries in the adjustment of 
individual prices and provide more information regarding the dynamic of the data. In addition, as such 
a procedure utilises the full structure of the model, it should have higher power, provided the model is 
true, than univariate procedures, which ignore the restrictions imposed by the multivariate structure. 
This is the approach followed in this paper, which is described in the following section. 

2.1 Threshold cointegration  

Studies on price transmission using threshold error correction models (either univariate or 
bivariate) have either considered one threshold (λ1) to separate the adjustment process into two 
regimes (Balke and Fomby, 1997; Enders and Granger, 1998, Abdulai, 2000 and 2002, Hansen and 
Seo, 2002) or two thresholds (λ1 and λ2) to separate the adjustment process into three regimes 
(Obstfeld and Taylor, 1997; Goodwin and Piggott, 2001; Serra and Goodwin, 2002, Meyer, 2003, 
etc.). Several authors suggest that a price adjustment model with three regimes separated by two 
thresholds has more economic sense than a two regime model with only one threshold (Meyer, 2003).   

In this paper we start our analysis by considering a general three-regime Threshold Vector Error 
Correction Model (TVECM3) to analyse price dynamics along the Spanish lamb chain. Let 
Pt=(P1t,P2t)’ be the log price of a good at two different levels of the marketing channel, assuming that 
Pt is a vector of I(1) time series which is cointegrated with a common cointegrating vector 

. The linear VECM representation of order k of P),1( 2β−=β′ t can be written as:

that are assumed to be independently and identically Gaussian distributed, with a covariance matrix Σ 
which is assumed to be positive definite. β is the cointegrating vector which is commonly interpreted

as the long-run equilibrium relation between the two prices in Pt , while α gives the weights of the 
cointegration relationship in the VECM equations.

(TVECM3), can be written as:

different regimes.  

As can be observed, the TVECM3 in (2) specifies that the adjustment towards the long-run 
equilibrium relationship is regime specific. This model says that the dynamic adjustment of Pit 
depends on the magnitude of . A special case of the TVECM given in (2) occurs if price 
changes are smaller than transaction costs. In this case, prices will not adjust in the second regime (in 
the middle one) implying that prices are not cointegreted, that is, α

called Band-TVECM. In this case, if )(t βω  is within the band then prices are not cointegrated and Pt 
follows a VAR(k) without a drift. However, in the outer bands economic forces push prices moving 
together implying cointegration with different adjustment coefficients. If )(t βω  >λ

then the cointegrating vector reverts to the regime- specific mean with adjustment coefficient2 ρ3 (ρ1) 
while  adjusts to the long run equilibrium with a speed of adjustment vector αtP∆

3 (α1). It is 
important to emphasise that the speed of adjustment of prices in the outer bands can be different for 
each element of Pt. The resulting model is given by:

However, the above model does not say anything about the direction of causality and the 
asymmetric adjustment process. Information about such features is provided by the α  coefficients. In 
general, we expect  and α , that is, prices adjust to the long-run equilibrium when price 
changes are large. In any case, and assuming a two-price system (i.e. prices at retailing (p

Note that when threshold parameters (λ1 and λ2) are both fixed (known a priori), the model is 
linear in the remaining parameters. In such circumstances, and under the assumption that errors εt are 
iid gaussian, parameters in model (3) can be estimated by multivariate least squares. 

However, in general, the threshold parameters (λi’s) are unknown and need to be estimated along 
with the remaining parameters of the model. Lo and Zivot (2001) propose a strategy which combine 
the Hansen’s (1999) approach to estimate two- and three-regime univariate TAR models and the Tsay 
‘s (1998) procedure to estimate multivariate TVECM. This strategy consists of the following steps. In 
the first step, a two-dimensional grid searches are carried out to estimate the threshold parameters 

 under the following assumptions: i) threshold parameters are such that  where ),( 21 λλ 2,1,2 =Γ∈ iiλ
( ){ }∞<<<<<−∞ UL λλλλλ 212 :=Γ λ12 ,  (this assumption restricts all threshold parameters to lie in the 

bounded subset [λL, λU]), and ii) the search is restricted to ensure an adequate number of observations 
for estimating the parameters in each regime. 

In practice, the analysis is conducted by imposing an ad-hoc bound for the number of 
observations in each regime. Letting Ti the number of observations in regime i, Hansen (1999) 
suggests constraining the threshold parameters such that 0/ π≥TiT , with typically (π0) set to 0.1. 

Conditional on λ  the TVECM (3) is linear in the A)( 21 λλ= (i)’s and may be estimated by 
sequential multivariate least squares minimising:

( ) and that the parameters of AΣ→λΣλ→λ→ )ˆ(ˆ  and  ,ˆ,AÂ 3
iiii (i)’s matrices are asymptotically 

normally distributed. 

The third step consists of testing if the dynamic behaviour and the adjustment towards the long-
run equilibrium relationship is linear or exhibits threshold non-linearity. Several univariate and 
multivariate test for linearity that have power against the threshold alternative have been proposed in 
the literature (Balke and Fomby (1997), Hansen (1997, 1999), Hansen and Seo (2002), Tsay (1998). 

Lo and Zivot (2001) suggest the Hansen’s method for testing linearity in univariate TAR models 
based on nested hypothesis tests and which can be easily extended to test linearity in multivariate 
TVECMs. They propose the sup-LR statistic:

where  and are the residual covariance matrices of the VECM and three-regime TVECM, 
respectively. 

Σ̂ )ˆ(ˆ 3 λΣ

The statistic to test such a hypothesis suffers from the problem of the so-called unidentified 
nuisance parameters under the null hypothesis. In other words, the non-linear model contains certain 
parameters which are not restricted under the null hypothesis and which are not present in the linear 
model. Consequently, the conventional statistical theory cannot be applied to obtain the asymptotic 
distribution of the statistics (see Davies, 1987; Hansen, 1999 and Hansen and Seo, 2002). Given that 
the test statistic has a non-standard distribution, Hansen (1999) and Hansen and Seo (2002) suggest 
using the fixed regressor bootstrap or, alternatively, a parametric residual bootstrap algorithm, to 
compute the p-value for the linearity tests.  

Once the presence of threshold effects is confirmed, in the empirical analysis there are several 
questions that they would have to be answered before allowing the researcher to interpret results. In 
this context, the most important, with no doubt, is to determine which kind of threshold model is more 
appropriated for the data (number of regimes, TVECM or Band-TVECM, and symmetric or 
asymmetric threshold model). Two approaches have generally been considered to determine the 
appropriate threshold specification. The first approach uses a model selection criterion (AIC, SBC, 
etc.) to determine the best specification form the data (Tsay, 1998). Following Hansen (1999), Lo and 
Zivot (2001) consider nested hypothesis tests based on an unrestricted estimation of the TVECM. 
They consider, first, the determination of the number of regimes. Thus, in order to test the null of a 
TVECM2 (two-regime model) against the alternative of a TVECM3 (three-regime model) they propose 
the following Likelihood Ratio (LR) statistic:

2 and three-regime TVECM3, respectively. The asymptotic distributions of LR2,3 are 
non-standard and bootstrap methods can be used to compute approximate p-values. 

Once the number of regimes has been established, they propose specification tests for the Band-
TVECM. Since the estimated threshold parameters from the TVECM are superconsistent, as 
mentioned previously, then a Wald test can be used, by defining appropriate restrictions on the 
TVECM parameters, which follows an asymptotic chi-square distribution.  

2.2 Non-linear impulse response functions 

Once the TVECM has been estimated, it is useful to analyse the short-run dynamic behaviour of 
the variables by computing the impulse response functions. This can be particularly suitable for 
studying the time path response of variables to unexpected shocks at time t. However, given that the 
non-linear time series model does not have a Wald representation, computing the IRF for these types 
of models is not an easy task. In addition, as discussed in Koop et al. (1996), the complications arise 
because in non-linear models: i) the effect of a shock depends on the history of the time series up to 
the point where the shock occurs; and ii) the effect of a shock depends on the sign and the size of the 
shock. As a consequence, in non-linear models impulse response functions depend on the combined 
magnitude of the history Pt-1=ωt-1 and the magnitude of the shock δ (relative to the threshold value λ) 

The Generalised Impulse Response Functions (GIRF) introduced by Koop et al. (1996) and Potter 
(1995) offer a useful generalisation of the concept of impulse responses to non-linear models. Their 
analysis focused on the asymmetric response of the variables to one standard deviation of both 
positive and negative shocks.  The Non-linear Impulse Response Functions (NIRF) are defined in a 
similar manner to traditional GIRF, except for replacing the standard linear predictor by a conditional 
expectation. Hence, the NIRF for a specific shock δ=ε t  and history Pt-1=ϕt-1  (the history of the 
system) is defined as:

 Taking into account this definition, it is clear that the NIRF is a function of δ∈εt and ϕt-1∈Ωt-1 
(Ωt-1 is the history or information set at t-1 used to forecast future values of Pt). Given that δ and ϕt-1 
are realisations of the random variables Ωt-1 and εt, Koop et al. (1996) stress that NIRF themselves are 
realisations of random variables given by: 

[ ] [ ]1tnt1ttnt1tt |PE,|PE),,n(NIRF −+−+− Ω−Ωε=Ωε      (9) 
From (9), there are a number of alternative ways to calculate the NIRF, depending on the research 

objectives. For instance, in this study we have considered it relevant to assess the responses of 
wholesale (retail) prices to shocks in retail (wholesale) prices under different evolution price regimes, 
and under different sizes and signs of the initial shock. Thus, the NIRF can be used to evaluate the 
degree of asymmetric responses over time.

In this section we perform the multivariate threshold cointegration approach described above to 
analyse the price transmission mechanism along the Spanish lamb marketing chain. Empirical 
specification TVECM involves the following steps: i) under the assumption of prices non-stationarity, 
the first step consists of testing for cointegration and estimating the cointegrating relationships; ii) if 



cointegration is found, the next step consists of determining whether the dynamics of the data can be 
described by threshold-type nonlinearities; iii) estimation and evaluation of the bivariate threshold 
error correction model (TVECM), and iv) non-linear Generalised Impulse Response functions are 
calculated in order to analyse the response of each prices to unanticipated positive and negative 
shocks. Each of these steps is addressed in turn in this section. 

As mentioned in Section 3, our empirical analysis uses weekly data of farmer prices (FP), and 
retail (RP) prices along the period 1993-2002. All variables are expressed in natural logarithms. For 
cointegration analyses among prices, it is common to use logarithms because otherwise, with trending 
data, the relative error is declining through time (Banarjee et al., 1993). On the other hand, Tiffin and 
Dawson (2000) suggest that the logarithmic transformation is appropriate because the variance is 
related to the mean and the relative error is constant for the series in levels. From an economic point of 
view, this transformation allows to relate prices in terms of percentage variations instead of absolute 
changes. 

Previous to the cointegration analysis among the price series, we first examine their stochastic 
time series properties. Seasonality has been investigated by implementing seasonal unit root tests for 
weekly data following the procedure suggested by Cáceres (1996) and Cáceres et al. (2001)4. Results 
from these statistics clearly suggest that seasonality is deterministic for the three price series. 
Accordingly, the systematic component of seasonality, to be parsimonious, has been adequately 
captured by using a Fourier-type series expansion.  

Time series univariate properties have been examined by using unit root tests. As in small 
samples such tests have limited power, two alternative unit root tests developed by Elliot et al., (1996) 
and Ng and Perron (2001) as well as the stationary test from Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) (KPSS) have 
been applied. All tests are consistent with the presence of a unit root in the three price series, satisfying 
the first necessary condition for cointegration analyses5. 

3.2. Cointegration analysis 
In this section we address the first step to specify a TVECM (i.e. testing for cointegration and 

estimating the cointegrating relationship). Cointegration is tested using the likelihood ratio test 
introduced by Johansen (1988). Escribano and Mira (1996) show that the cointegrating vector can still 
be estimated superconsistently in the presence of neglected non-linearity in the adjustment process. 
Before determining the cointegration rank, each system has to be correctly specified. More precisely, 
what deterministic components must be included and what is the optimum lag that ensures that 
residuals are approximately white noise and have zero autocorrelations at all lags. In this paper, the 
optimum lag has been selected on the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the 
Likelihood Ratio test proposed by Tiao and Box (1981). Both tests provide consistent results and 
indicate that four lags would be the optimum lag in the system.  

Misspecification tests for autocorrelation and normality, described in Doornik and Hendry 
(1997), have been carried out for each system to check for the statistical adequacy of the model. 
Results indicate that models specified above are quite satisfactory (Table 1). However, due to excess 
kurtosis, normality of residuals is rejected which may be caused by neglected nonlinearity. Table 1 
also shows the results of the Johansen likelihood ratio tests for cointegration rank. At the 5% level of 
significance, both tests indicate that the null hypothesis of one cointegrating vector cannot be rejected. 
Given that the cointegrating rank is one, we have tested whether the price transmission between farm 
and retail prices is perfect in the long run. This hypothesis states that the cointegrating vector β should 
satisfy the long-run price homogeneity condition (1,-1). All restriction tests on the cointegrating vector 

                                                 

4 The procedure is similar to that used by Franses (1991), for monthly data, and it is based on the decomposition of 
the polynomial (1-L52). The description of the procedure has not been included due to space limitations. In any case, 
results are available from authors upon request.

are asymptotically χ2(v) distributed where v is the number of imposed restrictions6. Results from the 
Likelihood Ratio (LR) statistic (second row of Table 1) show that the homogeneity restriction cannot 
be rejected and has empirical support.. The restricted cointegrating vector is given by: 

LnRP – lnFP = 0.448         (10) 

The constant term in (10) represents the price spread at the retail levels. Taking into account that 
all prices are expressed in logarithms, equation (10) represents percentage spread models with a mark-
up of (eα-1) (with α being the constant) (Tiffin and Dawson, 2000). Hence, the retail marketing margin 
can be expressed as follows: 

Retail margin = (eα-1)×FP×100  = 56%FP       (11) 

3.3. Threshold cointegration 
Once the presence of a long run equilibrium relationship between the two prices has been 

detected the next question is whether possible nonlinearities exist in the adjustment process. This 
question will be analysed using the procedure described in Section 3. We start by testing nonlinearity 
and, in case the null of linearity is rejected, the number of regimes in the  TVECM is determined 
considering the estimated cointegrating vector, given in (11), as the threshold variable (ωt-1)7. Results 
from the LR linearity test against the alternative of a multivariate TVECM3 (LR1,3) are shown in Table 
2 and indicate that the null of linearity is rejected at the 5% level, in favour of the threshold model.

the Spanish lamb marketing chain can be characterised by a three-regime threshold process. At the 
bottom of Table 2 the estimated threshold parameter from the TVECM3 is showed 

( ). In other words, and taking into account (11), the TVECM splits the price 
adjustment processes depending on whether the retail marketing margin lies below 52%, above 71% 
or between 52% and 71%. Figure 1 reports the evolution of farm and retail prices under the three 
regimes according to the corresponding threshold parameter. As can be observed from Figure 1, the 
first regime (marketing margin below the threshold level) can be associated with increasing phases of 
lamb prices (excess demand), while the third regime (marketing margin above the threshold level) 
seems to be associated with periods of declining prices (excess supply). The second regime is 
associated with transition periods, that is, when prices star to rise or to decline. These results are quite 
consistent with those found for the United States by Breimyer (1957) who concluded that, in the short-
run, marketing margins tended to increase when production also increases, while they decreased with 
production shortages, being quite stable in the long-run.

The estimated TVECM3 coefficients are shown in Table 3 as well as results from misspecification 
tests. As can be observed, results of diagnostic tests suggest that the estimated models are adequate as 
there is no evidence for remaining residual autocorrelation, ARCH tests fail to reject the null of 
homocedasticity and, finally, normality cannot be rejected. Moreover, the estimated parameters in the 
outer regimes are significant and have the expected sign. However, in the middle regime (regime 2) 
adjustment coefficients are not significant, indicating that adjustment only takes place till the edge of 
the threshold band. Within the band, the two prices move closer to each other but without following 
any specific pattern.

Considering this result, the TVECM3 could be re-specified as a Band-TVECM as it has been 
defined in Section 3.  A Wald test is carried out to check if adjustment coefficients in the middle 
regime are jointly significant. Results indicate that the null of no significance cannot be rejected at the 
5% significance level (the Wald statistic is 3.31, while the critical value is 5.99 at 5% of significance 
level). Consequently, it can be concluded that Band-TVECM is more appropriate than the unrestricted 
TVECM to represent the asymmetric adjustments of lamb prices along the marketing channel.  

The estimated parameters of the Band-TVECM are given in Table 4. Furthermore, we include the 
estimates of the adjustment parameters iρ̂ , which measure how the cointegrating vector reverts to the 

 

 

11



regime-specific mean (see footnote 2). As can be observed, the estimated parameters iρ̂  in regime 1 
are always lower than those in the upper regime. A smaller iρ̂  means that price adjustments after 
disequilibria are faster. In the lower regime ρ̂  is 0.682 and increase to 0.867 in the upper regime.

The speed of adjustment is usually measured by the so-called half-life [ln(0.5)/ln( )] which 
states the number of periods required to reduce one-half of a deviation from the long-run equilibrium 
(Obstfeld and Taylor, 1997). Taking into account the results mentioned in the above paragraph, the 
half-life increases from 1.80 weeks to 4.83 weeks. This results indicates that the adjustment induced 
by a negative deviation from the stationary price relationship is much faster than when it is induced by 
a positive deviation.  

In any case, as we have already mentioned in the previous section, the key feature in threshold 
models is the pattern of the estimated coefficients of the α matrix (αij) associated to the cointegrating 
vector ωt-1(β). These coefficients can be useful to analyse which prices “equilibrium adjust”, and 
which do not. The first interesting point to note is that the estimated coefficients corresponding to the 
lower regime, in absolute values, are larger than those corresponding to the upper regime, indicating 
that the speed of adjustment is more rapid for negative than for positive deviations from the threshold 
values. Given that the lower (upper) regime indicates that the marketing margin is below (above) its 
long-run equilibrium value, this suggests that prices react more rapidly when the margin is squeezed 
than when it is stretched. These results would appear to be quite consistent with those reported by von 
Cramon-Taubadel (1998). 

During the lower-margin regime (first regime), the adjustment coefficients are significant, 
indicating a feedback effect between the two prices. In addition, estimated coefficients indicate that 
the speed of adjustment of the retail prices is more rapid than that of the farm prices (after a negative 
deviation from the long-run equilibrium relationship, the retail price adjusts by eliminating 21% of 
such a negative impact generated in the previous period, while in the case of the farm price the 
adjustment is only about 10.5%). In the upper regime, adjustment coefficients are significant for the 
farm price, but not for the retail price. Thus, a positive shock on the price spread between the two 
levels of the marketing chain will initiate an adjustment process in the farm price, but not in the retail 
price, indicating that retail prices are sticky relative to farm prices when the marketing margin is 
squeezed.

3.4. Short-Run Dynamics 
Short-run dynamics have been analysed by computing the IRF, which show the response of each 

price in the system to a shock in any other price. In this study, Non linear IRF (NIRF) have been 
calculated for each regime prices are expected to react (regimes 1 and 3). In a context of non-linear 
models, NIRF are a very useful tool, as they allow us to differentiate responses to both positive and 
negative shocks. Moreover, the time at which the shock takes place is relevant, and thus, we could 
expect different responses depending on which of the regimes the shock is produced.  

In order to analyse the asymmetric behaviour of price adjustments, the NIRF have been computed 
for δ=±1 and ± 2 and for history-specific regimes such that the long-run equilibrium relationship 
[ 1)( −′= tit Pββω ] (i=1,2 for the first and second system, respectively) is above or below the upper and 
lower threshold values. In each regime, the NIRF for each forecasting horizon is the average across all 
possible Ni histories (with Ni being the number of observations in the ith regime). For each response, 
we have computed the corresponding 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping techniques based 
on 5,000 replications8. Figure 2 shows main results. Under the first regime, i.e. when prices are 
increasing (Figure 2, Panel a), a 1% positive shock to the retail price generates and immediate and 
significant response of both prices. However, the magnitude of such responses is quite different. The 
farm price exhibits a certain delay in adjusting to the new situation, reaching the maximum response 
after three weeks. Thus, although in the long-run both prices are perfectly integrated, in the very short-
run retailers benefit from a demand shock as the price spread increases by 50%. The situation is quite 
similar when the magnitude of the shock is 2%, generating responses, which, approximately, doubled 
those generated by a 1% positive shock.  

Responses of retail and farms prices to a negative demand shock at the retail level have a similar 
pattern than in the case of positive shocks although two main differences exist. First, responses are 
significant for a shorter period and, second, the magnitude of the response is lower during the first 10 
weeks after the shock, mainly in the case of the retail price, suggesting that positive shocks are more 
persistent and generate positive asymmetries. Moreover, although in the first week the negative 
response of the retail price in higher than that of the farm price, the situation reverse from then 
generating increasing price spreads since the third week after the shock. 

A positive shock in the farm market notably stretches the marketing margin the first week after 
the shock, as the farm price response is about 40% of the magnitude of the initial shock while in the 
case of the retail price, the response is only about 20%. However, during the following weeks, the 
retail price overreacts to the initial shocks, increasing the price spreads for about 6 weeks after the

shock. The existence of only one week of delay to react has to do with the specific characteristics of 
lamb. It is a perishable product mainly sold in big pieces the butcher has to cut. No labels, apart from 
specific quality labels, are present. Thus, menu costs are irrelevant, as retailers have to change only the 
price. In the case of specific cuts already packed, the stock disappears in less than one week. If the 
magnitude of the initial shock doubles, then the magnitude of the responses is more than proportional.

Responses of farm and retail prices to excess supply shocks (independently of the magnitude) 
have a similar path. However, the magnitude of such responses are different, being persistently higher 
in the case of the farm price, thus generating increasing price spreads, which benefit retailers. As can 
easily be observed, comparing the responses to positive and negative farm market shocks, the price 
adjustment process is positive-asymmetric (price increases are transmitted faster than price decreases). 
Finally, the magnitude of the asymmetric effect is greater in the case of the retail price, suggesting that 
inflation in food products is not generated by cost increases, but rather by increases in marketing

margins. These results seem to indicate that retailers have certain market power in the lamb market in 
Spain, as is the case with most perishable products. As Bettendorf and Verboven (2000) show, price 
behaviour is related to market concentration and oligopsonistic behaviour. In fact, retailers are much 
more concentrated than farmers, at least in the case of supermarkets and hypermarkets chains 
operating at national level. 

Under the third regime, i.e. when prices are falling (Figure 2, Panel b) the general pattern are 
more or less the same although three main differences may be appreciated. First, the magnitude of the 
responses is lower, especially in the case of negative shocks. Second, the convergence towards the 
long-run equilibrium takes place more quickly, independently of the magnitude of the initial shock. 
Third, when declining prices variations in the magnitude of the initial shock generate responses more 
than proportional when the shock is positive but much less than proportional when the shock is 
negative.  

In general terms, all considered cases lead to increasing price spreads in the short run, benefiting 
retailers, with the only exception of a negative shock in the retail price, in which retail prices decrease 
slightly faster than farm prices. In an environment of declining prices, retailers are not able to push 
farm prices significantly down in order to guarantee long run supply. In any case, the reduction of the 
price spread in this specific case is substantially lower in absolute values than the increase that takes 
place after a positive shock. Finally, short-run responses to positive shocks are higher than those for 
negative shocks, indicating, as in the first regime, the existence of positive asymmetries. 

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This paper has explored the non-linearity in the price transmission mechanism along the lamb 
marketing chain in Spain.  The methodology used has been based on the specification and estimation 
of a three-regime TVECM in which regimes are associated with price cycles. Moreover, price 
reactions in the intermediate regime are not significant allowing us to specify a Band-TVECM. 
Obtained results suggest a number of points. 

In the long-run, prices at both extremes of the marketing chain are perfectly integrated; that is to 
say, any change in any of the prices is fully transmitted to the other. However, in the short-run, price 
behaviour has to be with the structure of the retail sector. Retailers have clearly market power. Two 
thirds of total lamb sales at retail level are located in supermarkets and hypermarkets in which the 
market share of the top-five is around 60%. The main conclusion is that, in an environment of 
increasing prices, retailers benefit from any shock, whether positive or negative, that affects supply or 
demand conditions. In the first case, a shock to the farm price notably stretches the marketing margin 
in the very short run (one week after the shock) but then the retail price overreacts to the initial shock, 
increasing price spreads for about one month. In the second case, the price spread immediately 
increases by 50% and persists during one month and a half. Price adjustments are positive-asymmetric 
suggesting that retail prices show more nominal flexibility when they are increasing.  

Under a price-declining situation, the general pattern is rather similar. However, responses 
converge more rapidly to the long-run equilibrium and they are much higher when shocks are positive 
than when they are negative as further price decreases can generate short-run losses.  

The analysis has focused on vertical price adjustments in the Spanish lamb marketing chain. It 
can be extended in several directions. First, a natural extension will be to investigate other meat 
sectors in Spain with different market structures (different degrees of market integration) or other food 
sectors with different characteristics (branded products, more processed products, non-perishable 
products, etc) to better understand the price transmission mechanism and to what extent farm prices 
are responsible of inflation. Also, further applications to the same sector in other countries with 
different market structures would allow us to link our results with market power or holding stocks 
policy. Finally, further refinements from the methodological point of view could be used in the future 
as new theoretical econometric issues arise in the context of non-linear models in a multivariate 
framework.
