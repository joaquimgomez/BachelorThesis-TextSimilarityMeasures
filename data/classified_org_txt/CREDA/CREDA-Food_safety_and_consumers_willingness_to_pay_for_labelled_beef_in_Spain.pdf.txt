Food Safety and Consumers’ Willingness to Pay for 

Labelled Beef in Spain 

Ana M. Angulo, José M. Gil and L. Tamburo1 

 

 

Abstract. The objective of this paper is to assess the quality/safety value for beef consumers 

measuring their willingness to pay a price premium for labelled beef. From a survey conducted 

among food shoppers within the household, consumers are segmented according to their safety 

perception of specific food products. For each segment, their willingness to pay for labelled beef is 

calculated. Finally, the main factors explaining such a decision are considered. The results indicate 

that food scares, the perception of a negative impact of agricultural production on the environment 

and health concerns are having a major impact on the food consumer purchasing decisions for beef. 

However, most consumers are not willing to pay a price premium for labelled beef.

1. Introduction 

In recent years, both the supply and demand for food products has experienced important 

changes. On the supply side, a new technological revolution is taking place which has substantially 

increased the number of food products available to the final consumer. Technological processes 

have become increasingly complex which have also generated new concerns regarding their long-

run effects on the environment and/or the human health (GMO, etc.). On the demand side, food 

markets in developed countries, especially in Europe (Henson, 2001), are facing marketing 

problems mainly related to consumers’ loss in confidence in the food chain. Recent food scares 

have led to a significant reduction in the consumption of affected products which, in many cases, 

were already affected by saturation and decreasing trends. As a consequence, food safety has 

become an important issue in food consumers’ choices, inducing policy makers to increase controls 

along the food chain.  

Partly due to these changes, many authors in recent years have begun analysing consumers’ 

increasing concerns about food safety as well exploring the potential impact of both marketing and 

policy strategies specially designed to mitigate their loss of confidence in food products. Some 

authors have designed “ad hoc” surveys to evaluate to what extent consumers took into account 

food safety issues when making food choices (Wessells et al, 1996; Cowan, 1998; Verbeke and 

Viaene, 1999, 2001; Porin and Mainsant, 1998; Henson and Northen, 2000, among others).  

Food safety concerns have been particularly important in the beef sector in Europe where 

consumption has been reduced due to the BSE crisis2. The recovery of beef consumption to past 

levels has been a challenge in which producers, manufacturers and policy makers have participated. 

Product quality systems and controls have been reinforced to guarantee that food products were safe 

                                                 
2 The impact has been different among countries but in all of them the reduction of consumption has been 
substantial (France (40% of reduction), Germany (60%), Italy (42%), Portugal (30%) and Spain (35%)) 
(AgraEurope, 2001).

enough. However, food safety is a credence attribute (it cannot be observed by consumers neither 

before nor after purchasing the product). Thus, certification strategies (traceability and/or quality 

labels) have been implemented both at European and national levels to communicate to consumers 

the safety characteristics of the labelled beef. Moreover, the aim of these strategies has been 

twofold: to differentiate the product in a environment of saturated beef markets and to create a 

positive consumers’ perception towards labelled beef, based on a regular and homogeneous quality, 

allowing producers to maintain or mitigate beef consumption reduction due to food scares (Cartay, 

2001; Latvala and Kola, 2001; Stefani and Henson, 2001).  

Reinforced controls or, at least, the stricter application of the already existing regulation, 

have increased production costs both at the producer, wholesale and retail levels, which ultimately 

have been transmitted to consumers through higher prices as an indication of a safer/higher quality 

product. The main objective of this paper is to determine to what extent Spanish consumers are 

willing to pay a price premium for certified beef, with labels indicating beef traceability. To achieve 

this objective, a nation-wide telephone survey dealing with different food safety issues from the 

consumer point of view was conducted among Spanish households.   

Several studies have already analysed such issues in meat or other food products (Fisher, 

1995; Henson, 1996; Buzby et al., 1998; Caswell, 1998; Latouche et al, 1998; Zanetti, 1998; 

Sánchez et al, 2001, among others). The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, specific market 

segments based on consumers’ perceptions of food product safety are considered in order to detect 

differences in consumers’ willingness to pay. Second, this paper is one of the first attempts made to 

determine the main factors explaining consumers’ willingness to pay for safer food products, 

specifying a discrete choice model to tackle with such issue.  

 The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 shows the survey design as well as some 

descriptive results on consumers’ concerns, changing habits and perceptions on food safety which

have been used to identify market segments. Section 3 specifies the model that has been used to 

explain consumers’ decision to pay or not to pay (and how much) a premium for certified beef. It 

further discusses consumer segments’ willingness to pay for certified beef and outlines potential 

factors which could explain such a decision. Section 4 presents the main results from estimated 

models. In the last section, some concluding remarks are made. 

 

2. Consumers’ concerns and perceptions on food safety in Spain 

As previously mentioned in the introduction, data used in this study come from a nation-

wide telephone survey conducted in Spring 2002. Only respondents over 20 years of age and 

responsible for the shopping within the household were selected. A total of 650 valid responses 

were obtained. The sample was randomly selected, although a quota system was established to 

guarantee sample representativeness in terms of geographic and age distribution. The questionnaire 

was structured into four main sections. In the first, questions related to consumers’ concerns about 

food safety, how information had been received and to what extent food habits had change, were 

included. In the second section, the questionnaire aimed to measure how safe consumers perceived 

alternative food products (vegetables, meat, ready-to-eat meals, etc), production processes and 

marketing channels, including food-away-from-home outlets. The third section collected 

information about consumers’ attitudes towards meat certification and labeling and their willingness 

to pay a premium for certified beef. Finally, some socio-economics as well as psychographic 

characteristics of respondents were included. 

Results from the survey indicate that the food scares that have taken place in Europe in 

recent years, especially the BSE, have substantially increased consumers’ concerns about food 

safety in Spain. As Table 1 depicts, 63% of respondents declared that they were more concerned 

than they were five years ago about food safety. If only the problem “per se” is considered, this 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 5 of 25 

result seems somewhat surprising, at least from a rational point of view, and some other factors 

have to be found to explain it. The most important factor contributing to such attitudes, without 

doubt, is the mass media coverage of recent food scares3. Moreover, 52% of respondents recognize 

that mass media exerts a high influence in their shopping and consumption habits. 

The extent to which increasing concerns about food safety have modified shopping 

behavior is shown at the bottom of Table 1. It seems that, although positively correlated, 

consumers’ concerns have not been corroborated by changes in food habits of the same magnitude. 

In any case, almost half of the respondents declared to have changed their shopping habits, which is 

a relatively high percentage. Respondents, then, were asked in which way they had changed. 

Around 81% of them had given up buying the product, 40% had started to read food labels more 

carefully, 28.5% had moved to brands which offered them more confidence and guarantee and, 

finally, 4% had changed the retail outlet in which they normally did the shopping4.  

(Insert Table 1 around here) 

Results mentioned above indicate that increasing consumers’ concerns regarding food 

safety derived from food scares has also generated a loss of confidence towards food which seems 

to be more important in the products involved in the corresponding food scare. We have tried to 

explore this point more thoroughly by asking respondents about their perceived safety of selected 

groups of products. Results are illustrated in Table 2 (first column). As can be observed along a five 

point-scale, respondents declare a higher loss of confidence in meat products, canned food, 

preserved food and ready-to-eat meals. Moreover, the standard deviations associated with such 

products are higher indicating some variability among consumers’ perceptions. 

                                                 
3 As an example, in Spain around 200 people die every year due to Salmonella with no incidence referred to 
by mass media. On the contrary, recent food scares such as the BSE or the foot and mouth disease have not 
provoked any human death in Spain. The real incidence of “traditional” diseases and recent food scares is 
different but it seems now the problem of food safety is a big issue. 
4 It was a multiple choice question (the sum of percentages does not necessarily add to 100).

Taking this result into account, a cluster analysis has been carried out to identify segments 

with different perceptions about food product safety. A two-step procedure has been carried out. In 

the first step, the average linkage hierarchical clustering method was used for grouping the 

respondents. The inspection of the plot of distances between merging clusters at each step of 

the clustering process indicates the possible existence of two or three clusters, as this 

measure increases significantly after that. As a second step, and in order to improved results 

obtained from hierarchical methods, the K-means non-hierarchical method was used, with group 

centroids from hierarchical method as initial seed points. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) 

is calculated to discriminate between two and three clusters. As differences were not significant, 

finally, two clusters have been considered. Results are shown in Table 2 (columns 2 and 3). The 

first segment (42% of the respondents) includes consumers with higher confidence in food products. 

The second one (58%) is the less confident group. As can be observed, for all products, the 

perceived safety is significantly lower (at the 1% level) for Segment 2. These differences are 

particularly important in beef and chicken (related to BSE and dioxins scares, respectively).  As a 

consequence, the main objective of this paper is to further analyse two segments in order to check if 

there exist significant differences between groups in relation to their willingness to pay for certified 

beef..

3. Modelling willingness to pay 

3.1. Model specification 

The methodological approach to calculate the respondents’ willingness to pay for certified 

beef assuring traceability has been conditioned to the question format. In this context, and after a

Pg 7 of 25 

brief explanation given to respondents about what traceability meant, we asked them to note the 

maximum amount of money they were willing to pay for certified beef. The respondent had six 

choices: 1) nothing; 2) up to 0.6 € per kilogram; 3) up to 1.2 €; 4) up to 1.8 €; 5) up to 2.4 €; and 6) 

more than 2.4 €. As the possible answers are bound by an upper limit, we faced a problem of 

grouped data. That is, respondents who were willing to pay a premium of, for instance, 1.3 € or 1.5 

€ would be grouped under the fourth alternative independently of the individual values. A second 

problem with this approach is that many respondents were not willing to pay anything (i.e. chose 

the first alternative). In that case, we have a problem of censored dependent variable. Both 

characteristics of the dependent variable have been taken into account in this paper in order to 

specify and estimate the appropriate model5. 

The six alternatives offered to individuals makes the observed dependent variable discrete. 

The relationship between the observed dependent variable and the maximum willingness to pay is 

given by the following sequence: 

No change:     iy =1   0
* ≤iy  

Up to 0,6 €/kg.     iy =2   6,00
* ≤< iy  

Up to 1,2 €/kg.     iy =3   2,16,0
* ≤< iy  

Up to 1,8 €/kg.     iy =4   8,12,1
* ≤< iy  

Up to 2,4 €/kg.     iy =5   4,28,1
* ≤< iy  

Other than 2,4 €/kg.   iy =6   
*

4,2 iy<  

                                                 
5 Donaldson et al. (1998) shows the appropriateness of this specification strategy (grouped data) over the 
consideration of individual values.

3.2 Willingness-to-pay for certified beef in Spain 

Before estimating the model given by (1) to (4), in this sub-section, let us briefly describe 

results obtained from the survey about respondents’ willingness to pay for certified beef, while in 

the next one we will consider the most relevant variables that have been taken into account to 

explain such a decision.   



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 9 of 25 

Table 3 shows the percentage of respondents, for each of the market segments defined in 

Section 2, who have selected one of the six premium alternatives offered to them. As can be 

observed, even though consumers are more aware of food safety issues, 72.5 % of consumers are 

not willing to pay a premium for a labelled beef with a traceability certificate. This result may have 

different interpretations. First, consumers may consider food safety as an inherent characteristic of 

food products (it is the minimum requirement food products may satisfy) and, then, they do not find 

any special reason to pay a premium. Second, food safety is something to be worried about but not 

such an important consideration as to be willing to pay more for it. Third, consumers may perceive 

that traceability is not enough to guarantee food safety. Under such circumstances, the 30% 

decrease in beef consumption that took place in Spain during 2001 (following the web site of the 

Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food: www.mapya.es) was mainly the result of the 

increasing prices (up to 20% as shown in the same web site) and could only be partially explained 

by the increasing consumers’ concerns on food safety. On the other hand, it is, to a certain extent, 

surprising that the higher percentage of consumers who are not willingness to pay is among segment 

2 which represents the sample which has a lower confidence in food. 

(Insert Table 3 around here) 

Looking at the figures in Table 3, it seems that respondents have concentrated their answers 

in the intermediate values offered to them.  In fact, 14.2% of respondents would be willing to pay 

up to 1.2 €/Kg for labelled beef, a percentage which is equally distributed between the two 

segments. The same thing occurred with the alternative response representing a price up to 1.8 

€/Kg, although in this case the percentage is only 6.6%. In the extreme values, percentages are 

lower. Only 3.7% would pay the minimum premium (up to 0.6 €/Kg), 1.7% would pay up to 2.4 

€/kg, and 1.4% would pay a higher premium. Given the higher percentage of zero responses, the 

chosen model specification seems appropriate in our study. In the following sub-section we will 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 10 of 25

explain what are the most relevant variables that have been considered to explain results from Table 

3. 

3.3. Factors explaining willingness-to-pay for certified beef in Spain 

The complete list of variables included in the model given by (1)-(4) is shown in Table 4. 

We have considered socio-economic characteristics of respondents (income, age, education 

level,…), some variables related with beef shopping behaviour (level of beef consumption and 

prices consumers are actually paying) and consumers’ attitudes towards food safety. Finally, as the 

traceability certificate is included in the product’s label, we have included one dummy variable 

related to the attention consumers pay to labels and their confidence in the information included in 

them. Actually, this variable is the result of two consecutive questions posed to consumers. In the 

first one, respondents were asked about how often they read food labels (five-point scale). In the 

second, they were asked about their confidence in them (five-point scale).  This variable takes the 

value 1, if the respondent reads labels often or very often and is confident or very confident with the 

information included, and 0, otherwise. 

(Insert Table 4 around here) 

 

4. Discussion of results 

The estimation strategy adopted in this paper consists of two main steps. In the first, we 

have estimated the willingness-to-pay model for each market segment defined in Section 2 taking 

into account the respondents confidence in the perceived safety of different food products. As a 

second step, we have estimated a single model for the pooled data in order to test for significant 

differences between market segments. In each step, a heteroskedasticity test has been carried out to 

check for model adequacy. In such tests we have assumed that the price variable was generating the 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 11 of 25

problem. Moreover, we have adopted an exponential function for the error term variance as this 

function has the desirable property whereby standard deviations are strictly positive (Yen and Su, 

1995). In the three estimated models (one for each segment and the pooled data model), the null 

hypothesis of homoscedasticity has not been rejected (the t-ratio of the price parameter in the 

auxiliary regressions were 0.67, 0.44 and 0.77, respectively). Thus, all models have been estimated 

assuming homoscedasticity. 

Table 5 shows the results from estimating the willingness-to-pay model for each market 

segment. Estimated parameters as well as standard deviations at t-ratios are included. Moreover, 

joint significance tests of explanatory variables consisting of more than one dummy variable (age, 

education level, income and frequency of purchasing) are depicted in table 6. In the latter case, all 

tests have been carried out using a likelihood ratio statistic.  

As can be observed, respondents’ overall satisfaction with food safety and with the 

nutritional content of food (SSAF and SNUT) do not have a significant effect on the consumers’ 

willingness-to-pay for certified beef in any of the two market segments considered in this study. 

The attention respondents pay to food labels and their credibility in the information included in 

them has a significant effect if this variable is introduced in a multiplicative way together with the 

overall satisfaction with food safety (INF*SSAF). However, this applies only for consumers who 

perceive food as being less safe (Segment 2). This would indicate that for consumers who read food 

labels more often and feel more confident about the information shown in them, have higher 

confidence in food safety and are thus willing to pay a higher premium for labelled beef with a 

traceability certificate. One might expect the opposite relationship to occur (i.e. less confident 

consumers of food safety would be willing to pay a higher premium for certified beef) which holds 

if we only consider the estimated parameter for INF (although it is not significant). However, when 

we consider the interaction between INF and SSAF, the positive sign would mean that in segment 2, 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 12 of 25

although consumers are less confident with beef safety, their preventive behaviour of reading labels 

guarantee them a purchase of safer products when paying a higher price.   

(Insert Table 5 around here) 

The price consumers are actually willing to pay for beef has a negative effect on their 

willingness-to-pay for labelled beef. If we assume that higher prices correspond to higher quality, 

consumers who are paying higher prices already think that they are buying safe enough beef and, 

then, have no incentive to pay a premium for beef traceability.  

Among the socio-economic variables, the household size does not have any significant 

effect on the willingness-to-pay for labelled beef in any of the market segments. The age of the 

respondent has only a significant effect in the case where consumers are more confident about food 

safety. The positive sign indicates that the older the respondent is, the higher premium he is willing 

to pay for certified beef. The education level is not significant in any of the segments. However, 

income becomes a key factor to explain consumers’ willingness to pay a premium for labelled beef. 

Moreover, the relationship is positive. 

(Insert Table 6 around here) 

Experience in beef shopping is also important to explain willingness-to-pay, but only in the 

case of consumers who are more confident in food safety (Segment 1). The effect is negative 

thereby indicating experienced consumers are willing-to-pay a lower premium if any. In other 

words, if after the BSE consumers are still buying beef regularly this is a clear indication that they 

are confident enough in their safety (or, alternatively, food safety is not a relevant attribute in 

consumers’ behaviour). Then, there is no need to pay a premium for certified beef. Finally, 

consumers living in the south of Spain and belonging to Segment 2 are willing-to-pay a higher price 

for labelled beef.  



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 13 of 25

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the second step in our study has been to 

estimate a single equation pooling the data from the two segments in order to test for significant 

differences among them. To do that a dummy variable has been introduced in the model (HCC) 

which takes the value 1, if the respondent belongs to Segment 1 (Higher Confidence Consumers), 

and 0, otherwise. The set of explanatory variables includes those already considered in the 

individual models plus a new set obtained as a product of the former variables and the new dummy 

HCC. In the new variables, the corresponding parameter will measure the existing differences 

between groups, while the t-ratio will indicate if such differences are significant at the desired level. 

The estimated parameters of the model including the pooled data as well as their standard deviations 

and t-ratios are shown in Table 7. The results from the joint significance tests of explanatory 

variables consisting of more than one dummy variable are included in Table 8.  

(Insert Table 7 around here) 

As can be observed, some significant differences have been found regarding the incidence 

of the different factors explaining market segments’ willingness to pay for certified beef, mainly in 

relation to socio-economic variables. On the contrary, the impact of attitudinal variables (towards 

food safety or towards the nutritional content of food) is similar in both market segments. Only a 

positive attitude towards the credibility in the information included in food labels plays an 

important role in explaining willingness-to-pay for certified beef in Segment 2; this result has been 

already mentioned above and is confirmed here by the statistical significance of the 

(INF*SSAF)*HCC parameter. 

Among the socioeconomic characteristics of respondents, the impact of the education level, 

income, household size and expertise in beef purchasing on the willingness to pay for certified beef 

is significantly different between market segments. Results from Tables 7 and 8 indicates that the 

less confident segment on food safety is more homogeneous, in terms of socio-economic 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 14 of 25

characteristics of respondents, while in the other segment such characteristics have an important 

role in explaining the potential premium consumers are willing to pay for labelled beef with a 

traceability certificate.   

(Insert Table 8 around here) 

 

5. Concluding remarks 

Recent food scares have generated an increasing loss of confidence in food safety among 

consumers. This has led to a reduction in the consumption of affected products, mainly beef. 

Several efforts have been made out to mitigate the effects of food scares on beef consumption. One 

of the most relevant has been the promotion of quality labels either with a traceability certificate or 

with an Protected Geographical Indication. More exhaustive controls have been applied which has 

increased production costs and, consequently, consumer prices. The aim of this paper has been to 

measure to what extent Spanish consumers value food safety. In other words, if they are willing to 

pay a premium for labelled beef with a traceability certificate. Additionally, we have tried to 

determine the main factors affecting such a decision.  

A nation-wide survey has been carried out in which specific questions were asked to 

achieve the mentioned objective. As a first step, the sample was segmented into two groups taking 

into account the respondents’ perceptions about the safety of different food products. The 

methodology used to estimate the respondents’ willingness to pay for certified beef has been 

conditioned to the question format. Among the different alternatives, in this paper we have offered 

respondents several upper limits of maximum price premiums they are wiling to pay among which 

they have to choose one. In this context, all respondents who were willing to pay a premium 

between two of the offered limits were assigned the upper limit. Thus, we faced to a problem of 



Food safety and consumers WTP for certified beef 

 

Pg 15 of 25

grouped data. The resulting model, which has also taken into account the large number of zero 

responses has been estimated by maximum likelihood. Alternative question formats would have 

generated different model specifications. We have considered that the format used facilitated 

respondents’ answers as they did not have to think of a specific premium. In any case, further 

research could be done in the future on the sensitiveness of question formats on consumers’ 

willingness to pay. 

Results obtained from this study show that although consumers are increasingly concerned 

about food safety issues, they are not willing to pay more for labelled beef with a traceability 

certificate. In fact, three-out-of-four respondents declare they are not willing to pay anything. This 

result, to a certain extent, allows us to assess both the real impact that food scares have had in Spain 

and the instruments that have been used to recover consumers’ confidence in food. In Spain, the 

mass media coverage of the BSE crisis generated a reduction of beef consumption, due to the 

increasing consumers’ concerns on food safety issues, but also provoked substantial beef price 

increases which, from our point of view, were not fully justified taking into account the slight 

reduction of supply. Results from estimated models indicate that consumers have perceived beef 

price increases, that have been generated by more rigorous controls implied by traceability, as a 

quality strategy and not as a safety strategy. In other words, traceability “per se” is not going to be 

able to recover beef consumption except for very specific market segments who are actually used to 

reading food labels and are confident with the information included in them. As a complementary 

strategy, beef price reductions, as those implemented in the UK, are expected to provoke a positive 

answer in consumers. Spanish consumers perceive food safety as a minimum responsibility 

producers have and do claim that producers should guarantee safety without consumers being 

obliged to pay a premium for it.
