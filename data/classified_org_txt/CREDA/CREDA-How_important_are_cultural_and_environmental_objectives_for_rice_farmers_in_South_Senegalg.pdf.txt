Abstract1 
 
 
 
This paper explores farmer-specific cultural, social and economic objectives within the 

extensive rice system in the Kolda region (south of Senegal). We classify and characterize 

farmers according to the relative importance of their multifunctional goals. The empirical 

analysis uses farm-level data collected through a face-to-face questionnaire to a sample of 

rice farmers. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to measure farmers’ primary 

and secondary objectives importance in planning their activities, and Cluster Analysis (CA) 

to classify and characterize farmers according to their priorities. Results suggest that within 

the “economic” role, the most important goals are “maximization of total farm income” 

followed by “improving rice quality”. Farmers are willing to “minimize fertilizers use”, both to 

reduce cost and to preserve environment. They recognize their potential role in “minimizing 

illegal immigration”. Results can be useful in guiding policy makers by considering farmers’ 

priorities at local level.

1. Introduction and objectives 
 

An inherent characteristic of agriculture is the joint production of commodity and 

non-commodity output which are in general valued by society and known as 

agricultural multifunctionality (Kallas, et al. 2007b). This concept has emerged as a 

key element in policy debates on the future of agriculture and rural development 

(Renting, 2009) not only at the European agricultural and rural policy but also at the 

international trade discussions (Potter and Tilzey, 2007). 

 

There is a debate about what multifunctionality in agriculture signifies and how 

it might be recognized in practice (Renting, 2009, Marsden and Sonnino, 2008; 

Wilson, 2007). However, an overall consensus about the definition of the concept is 

recognized. According to the formal definition (EC, 1998) it is the acknowledgment of 

three different roles played by agriculture: a) producing food and fiber products, b) 

preserving the rural ecosystem and landscape and c) contributing to the viability of 

rural areas and a balanced territorial development. 

 

This definition suggests that multifunctional agricultural production comprises 

both market and non-market goods. The former comprise mainly, although not 

exclusively, food and fiber products (economic function), while the latter include 

environmental and social functions, which in most cases also have public good 

characteristics. 

 

Agricultural multifunctionality has been intensely analyzed in EU countries from 

the supply side of the agricultural systems (provision of commodities and non-

commodities outputs) and from the demand side taking into consideration social 

welfare changes due to variation in the supply of different outputs. As a result of their 

analysis, an important aspect is that these functions are territorially specific, 

providing mainly local benefits and depending in a great measure on the agriculture 

system. Thus, effective policies set are usually formed at local level affecting directly 

rural society involved (Kallas, et al., 2008, Bjørkhauga and Richards, 2008). 

However, there is a scarce of these studies for developing and underdeveloped 

countries. A key question that may arise is if farmers in these countries are aware 



4 
 

about the multifunctionality role of their agricultural system and if these functions or 

objectives are taken into consideration when they plan their activities. 

 

The present study aims to expand the relatively sparse literature on agriculture 

multifunctionality in these countries. Concretely we explore from the supply side of 

agriculture multifunctionality, farmers’ objectives within the extensive rice culture in 

south Senegal. Furthermore, we seek to classify and characterize farmers according 

to the relative importance of their multifunctional objectives. Data used in this 

analysis were obtained from face-to-face questionnaires with 110 rice farmers 

carried out during March-June 2010 in the Kolda region in the south region of 

Senegal. 

 

The remainder of this paper consists of five main parts. Section 2 explains the 

methodology employed in this research. The next two sections introduce the case of 

study and the empirical application. In Section 5 results are discussed. Finally, some 

concluding remarks are outlined. 

 

2. Methodology 
 

To achieve our goal, we have proposed a methodological framework which is 

divided in different steps as can be seen in Figure 1.

2.1. The Analytical hierarchy Process: AHP 
 

The AHP is a multi-criteria decision-supporting method in discrete 

environments developed by Saaty in the late 70s (Saaty, 1977; 1980). It aims to 

decompose a complex decision problem in a hierarchy of smaller constituent sub-

problems. Determining the most considered objective from a set of goals is a 

decision problem where the top level of the hierarchy represents the concept 

valuation. It is decomposed into a predefined number of characteristics 

(attributes/primary objective) on the second level and their corresponding 

levels/secondary objectives on the third level. AHP estimates eliciting weights (w) for 

each attribute and attribute level in order to explain farmer behavior in relation to the 

agricultural multifunctionality concept. The relative importance or weight (w) for the 

primary function (objectives or attributes) and level (secondary functions or 

attributes) are obtained from pairwise comparisons. 

 

In order to implement the AHP, one needs to carry out a survey where 

individuals are asked to make two types of pairwise comparisons: a) a pairwise 

comparison of the levels within each attribute; and b) a pairwise comparison of the 

attributes. First, the respondent has to indicate which of the two elements the 

respondent prefers. Then a nine-point scale is used to measure the strength of this 

preference by means of verbal judgments. From the answers provided, a Saaty 

matrix with the following structure is generated:

where aijk represents the value obtained from the pairwise comparison between 

attribute/level i (iN / iP) and attribute/level j; (jN / jP) for each individual k. 

 

Under perfect consistency in preferences, K weights (wNk) for each attribute 

and K weights (wPk) for each level can be easily determined from the N(N-1)/2 values 

and P(P-1)/2 values for aijk respectively. However, perfect consistency is seldom 



6 
 

present in reality, where personal subjectivity plays an important role in the pairwise 

comparison. 

 

In order to estimate the weight vector that is better able to represent the 

decision-maker’s real weight vector, Saaty (1980; 2003) suggested two options as 

the accurate estimate of real weights: the geometric mean and the main eigenvector. 

As all criteria meet the requirements to estimate the above-mentioned weights, we 

choose the geometric mean (Aguarón and Moreno, 2000; Kallas, et al., 2007a). 

Using this approach, weights assigned by subject to each attribute and level are 

obtained using the following expression: 

PN PNi

The AHP was originally conceived for individual decision-making, but it was 

rapidly extended as a valid technique for the analysis of group decisions (Easley, 

Valacich and Venkataramanan, 2000). Thus, we need to aggregate the 

corresponding individual weights (wik) across farmers to obtain a synthesis of 

weights for each objective and level (wi). For The aggregation process, we consider 

the geometric mean as the most suitable method for aggregating individual weights 

(wik) in a social collective decision-making context (Forman and Peniwati, 1998):

With the aim to obtain and ordering weights for levels of each attribute, we 

need to calculate a global weight for each level ( _ n.pG Lw ). These global level 

weights are obtained by multiplying aggregated levels’ weights (wi for each level Ln.p) 

by its corresponding weight (wi) of attribute (An) as mentioned by Malvinas et al. 

(2005).

3. Case of study: the empirical application 

 

3.1. Geographical location  

 

Senegal is divided administratively into 14 regions which are divided into 45 

departments integrated in various rural communities (ANSD, 2008). The region of 

Kolda (southern Senegal) occupies an area of 21,011 km2 and has a population of 

847,243 inhabitants (ONG7a, 2008). It has three departments: Kolda, Sedhiou and 

Vélingara (Figure 1). The latter is the department used in our studied area. 

 

 

Figure 1: Case of study: Vélingra department in the Kolda region (Senegal). 
 

The population is predominantly young. Only 3.6% of the population is over 65 

years and almost 50% are under 15 years, resulting in a high dependency ratio. The 

percentage of women is slightly higher, especially in the age range from 20 to 40 

years which is when male population begins to migrate to other cities or countries. 

 

Poverty in rural environments and high unemployment rate make the 

immigration an important social problem. The schooling and compulsory education is 

very low and it mainly affects the female population. (PERD, 2008). Senegal has a 

high ethnic diversity such as wólofs (43,3%), peuls  (33,8%), séréres (14,7%), diolas 



8 
 

(3,7%), malinkés (3,0%), soninkés (1,1%) among others. In the studied area, the 

majority of population is of ethnic Peul (49.3%), followed by the Mandingo ethnic 

group (23.6%). Peul population comes from an essentially nomadic group who has 

been gradually settled during years. They are used to have animal farming in 

addition to some crops during the rainy season. Almost 60% of the Kolda population 

lives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main source of income.  

 

In the rural population, men are traditionally devoted to field work in subsistence 

farming or in other commercial crops. Women are responsible of the vegetables 

cultivation. This is realized on a very small scale in the rainy season. Most 

production is for household consumption and a small portion is sold at local markets. 

There is usually a large plot in most rural communities; each plot is cultivated by 150 

women, each of which takes care of her little part, which usually represent around 50 

m2. This farming activity is done together with other economic activities such as the 

production of palm oil soap and small shops of traditional souvenirs. Finally, it’s 

worth mentioning that in Senegal the tourism sector play an important role in the 

economy of the country, however, in the studied area is almost insignificant. 

 

The analyzed area is the least industrialized region of Senegal with a high 

potential of agricultural activities. It account for about 1,100,000 ha of arable land 

with only 23% devoted to agriculture. Water is abundant mainly from rainfall (1,200 

mm) and the presence of the Casamance River makes the rice culture as the most 

appropriate crop. 

 

3.2. Agricultural activities 

 

As commented, agriculture is the main source of income for local people. The 

Labour force in agriculture represents a great part of the total work force (70.24%) 

which has slightly decreased since 1995 (4.75%). However, the role of female is 

increasing in the agriculture work force (47.40% in 2010), leading to a rise of the 

rural population, highlighting female role in maintaining families’ economy in Senegal 

(Table 1). Finally, it is relevant mentioning that the share of the agriculture value 

added in total GDP account for only 20% (FAOSTAT 2010).

The agriculture production system in Senegal is based on rain-fed crops. Only 2% 

of land is devoted to irrigated crops. Senegal has an irrigation potential of 275,000 

ha of which about 100,000 ha are well prepared and less than 50,000 are cultivated 

annually. The main cereal crops are millet, sorghum, rice and corn (Table 2) and the 

industrial crops are mostly peanuts and cotton (FAOSTAT, 2010)

Regarding the rice crop, the total production shows a clear trend (Figure 2), with 

small variations. However since 2004 an increasing rate can be observed. Excluding 

the years 2006-2007 in which there were severe droughts, in 2008 the production of 

rice has increased rapidly, being close to meet the goal of rice self-dependence 

production.

Rice production systems in Senegal can be divided in two different types of rice 

cultivation: irrigated and rain feed culture. The latter is the most important in the 

studied area. In this context, aspects that make rice agriculture difficult are divided 

according to the cultivation types. In irrigated area agriculture problems are usually; 

non-efficient irrigation systems, low agricultural equipment, few subsidies, obsolete 

or inadequate equipment, difficulties in obtaining agricultural loans and the lack of an 

organized market system. The rain rice system shares some of the above mentioned 

problems beside the fact that all crops are managed manually (lack of 

mechanization), low use of inputs, low yields, difficulties to finance activities, erratic 

rainfall and the absence of quality seeds and adapted varieties. In general this 

system is characterized with its extensive activity being a good example for 

agriculture multifunctionality as a case study. Rice cultivation in vélingra area (Kolda 

region) is mainly developed in floodplains during the rainy season in the Anambé 

Basin. 

 

3.3. Sample selection 

 

Data used in this analysis were obtained from face-to-face questionnaires with 

rice farmers carried out during March-June 2010 in the Vélingra department in Kolda 

region in south Senegal. Our study was structured in two phases (Table 3). The first 

one consists of 4 interviews with local agents that represent public authorities in the 

area to have the first contact. Later, an open-ended questionnaire was carried out 

with 25 farmers located in 8 different villages that represent the most important

sector of rice farming area. These qualitative questionnaires were realized in order to 

identify farmers’ opinions, attitudes and objectives they usually consider in their rice 

farming management. The obtained information is used to design a structured 

questionnaire carried out in the second quantitative phase. In this part, 110 

questionnaires were done using a quota sampling approach. The criteria used to 

establish the sampling quotas were the village (where the farms are located) and 

age of farmers.

The survey collects extensive information on farmer’s characteristics, attitudes 

and opinions, farm physical and economic characteristics. Information collected on 

farmer and household characteristics includes age, gender, education, number of 

family members, or nearness of family and friends to farmer residence. Information 

gathered on farm characteristics consists of farm size, ownership of the farm, 

distance between farm and farmer residence, number of plots in the farm, water 

availability, soil quality, Variables reflecting farm management and results are: 

preferred sources of information on agricultural practices, proportion of rented land, 

number of cultivated crops, proportion of irrigated land, percentage of total family 

income coming from agriculture, number of generations working in the farm, total 

cost per hectare. Exogenous factors include, among others, difficulties in obtaining 

information, problems in getting loans, output prices or public subsidies. 

 

3.4. AHP model building

modeling is the first step to be carried out after carrying out the structures

questionnaire. Agricultural Multifunctionality by definition is a complex good involving 

various goods and services. Therefore, we need to clearly define what we are aiming 

to value and then to present to farmers (the interviewees) as clearly and precisely as 

possible to make the pair-wise comparisons. The strategy employed to describe 

multifunctionality was to identify and specify the most relevant attributes of the 

agricultural sector in the study area. With this in mind, we first relied on our 

qualitative prior research in phase 1 (see Table 3) regarding the identification of the 

objectives that agriculture should aim for, as expected by farmers. The exploratory 

results of this qualitative part of our research allowed us to determine three primary 

objectives being related to the three most important attributes of agriculture in this 

case study and considered to be included in the comparison: the economic, 

environmental and socio-cultural objectives.  

 

In addition, within each primary objective, other secondary objectives were also 

identified. Secondary economic objectives were: “maximize rice sales”, “maximize 

total farm income from agricultural and non-agricultural activities” and “maximize rice 

quality”. For the environmental secondary objectives we included: “promote 

environmental friendly farming practices”, “minimize use of fertilizers and conserve 

soil fertility” and “rational use of water”. Finally, for the secondary socio-cultural 

objectives we identified: “help eliminating illegal migration (job creation)”, “keep the 

existing socio-cultural values linked to rice culture” and “increase the participation of 

women in agricultural decision” (Table 4). The relevance of the corresponding 

functions (both primary and secondary objectives) were subsequently discussed in 

different focus groups; one comprising university lecturers in the field of agricultural 

economics and another one comprised by the local agriculture agents of the case 

study (from the qualitative phase mentioned in Table 3) in order to test their validity 

before starting interviewing farmers.

4. Results 

 

4.1. AHP Results 
 

As noted before, the AHP allows weights to be obtained for each farmer of their 

considered primary (attributes) and secondary objectives (levels), using the 

geometric mean criteria. The results of the aggregation of weights for the three 

primary objectives (wA1, wA2 and wA3) across farmers are shown in the Figure 3. 

 

These results suggest that the “economic” primary objective is the most important 

with an aggregate weight of 47.1%. The “Environmental” objective occupies the 

second position with an aggregate weight of 23.3%. In last position we found the 

“socio-cultural” objective with an aggregate weight of 18.1%.  

Results from weighting attributes’ levels (i.e. secondary objectives) are 

summarized also in Figure 4. As can be seen, there are differences in the weights for 

levels. For the “economic” primary objective, the most important secondary objective 

is “maximize total farm income from agricultural and non-agricultural activities” 

(33.3%) followed by “maximize rice quality” (28.1%) and “maximize rice sales” 

(19.7%). 

 

The highest weight for the “environmental” attribute is assigned to “promote 

environmental friendly farming practices” (29.7%) followed by “minimize use of 



14 
 

fertilizers and conserve soil fertility” (28.9%) and “rational use of water” (22.4%). 

Finally, in relation to the “socio-cultural” primary objective, the most important 

weights are associated with “help eliminate illegal migration by job creation (31.6%), 

followed by “to preserve existing cultural values linked to rice cultivation” (27.8%) 

and “Increase the participation of women in agricultural decision” (26.7%). 

 

As mentioned, the global weights represent the total preference score or the total 

relative importance of each secondary objective taking into consideration all 

objective. Thus, we find that the most considered secondary objective are all of them 

with economic nature. First, farmers consider the “maximization of total farm income” 

(21.6%) followed by “maximize rice quality” (18.2%) and “rice sales” (12.7%). Later it 

comes “promote friendly practices toward environment” (9.55%), “minimizing the use 

of fertilizers” (9.35%) and “helping to eliminate illegal migration” (7.92%). Finally, the 

last considered secondary objective for rice farmers is “increase the participation of 

women in the agricultural decision” (6.72%). In this line, it is relevant mentioning that 

these results scores of farmers’ objectives will be used in a following step as covariates to 

classify farmers following a cluster analysis.

4.2. Farmers’ cluster according to their objectives 
 

The specific aim of this analysis is to classify farmers into different homogeneous 

groups according to their identified objectives, using cluster analysis. This analysis is 

a set of techniques used to classify objects into homogeneous groups different from 

each other, called clusters with respect to some predetermined selection criteria. 

Objects within each cluster are "close" to each other and considered similar, and 

different cluster are "distant" and considered different. Therefore, it is also known as 

classification analysis or numerical taxonomy approach. 

 

We used the weights obtained from the AHP of the three primary objectives 

(economic, environmental and socio-cultural). As these variables are considered 

quantitative, we used the “euclidean distance” as a measure method between 

individuals and partitioning methods to identify clusters2. Finally on the basis of the 

economic and environmental objectives we identified two clusters3 (Table 5)

As can be seen in Table 5, clusters are clearly identified on the basis of the 

relative importance of the economic and environmental objectives. The first cluster is 

composed of 73 farmers that are economically driven with high preference toward the 

economic objective (62%) compared to cluster 2 formed by 37 farmers whose 

individuals give only 31% of importance of this objective. This cluster as can be 

observed is environmentally driven one giving more relative importance of the 

environmental objective (38%) compared to (17%) of the first cluster. In the following 

step we try to identify clusters’ in order to describe their profile.

3 Weight of the socio-cultural objective for cluster 1 (21%) and for cluster 2 (31%) was not significantly 
different between both clusters.

4.3. Description of farmers’ clusters 
 

To identify farmers’ characteristics in each cluster we used the ANOVA analysis 

for the quantitative variables and Pearson Chi-squared (2) test for the categorical 

variables. For the former group of variables, results (Table 6) show that farmers that 

are economically motivated in opposite to the environmental group are older, live 

near their farms, have higher crop area and more rice surface. They grow different 

crops in the rainy seasons and need new machinery in their field. They are not very 

committed to promote environmentally friendly farming practices. However, they are 

more interested in minimizing the use of fertilizers and conserving soil fertility. These 

results seem controversy, but could be understand from a cost point of view. Farmers 

by diminishing the use of fertilizers are trying to reduce production cost rather than 

their commitment to environment.

For the categorical variables, results show (Table 7) that 63.0% of the farmers in 

cluster 1 have the agriculture activity as their only source of income and 80.0% use 

machinery in rice growing, while only 73.0% of farmers in cluster 2 have other 

economic activities beside the agriculture and 64.9% use manual method in rice 

cultivation.

5. Concluding remarks 

 

Our paper focuses on assessing the relative importance of farmers’ objective in 

relation to agricultural multifunciontality in the extensive rice culture in vélingra region 

south Senegal. We carry out an empirical study using the Analytical Hierarchy 

Process to measure farmers’ primary and secondary objectives in planning their 

activities and cluster analysis to classify and characterize farmers according to their 

considered objectives. The model is estimated using farm-level data from a sample 

of 110 rice farmers. Data were collected through a face to face questionnaire carried 

out in 2010. 

 

Results from weighting farmers’ objectives suggest that the “economic” objective is 

the most important one followed by the “environmental” and “socio-cultural” 

objectives. Furthermore, as expected, maximizing the total farm income from 

agricultural and non-agricultural activities farmers is the most important secondary 

objective followed by maximizing rice quality. Farmers are aware of the importance of 

rice quality and recognize that it should be enhanced to better face their marketing 

problems. A main problem is the low perceived price due to irregular quality of their 

output. Using certified rice seeds seem to be a constraint for farmers due to their high 

cost. Public policy should focus on allowing farmers to easily access to certified 

seeds rather than other direct or indirect subsidies.  

 

Regarding the environmental objective, farmers try to use environmental friendly 

farming practices as the agriculture represent almost their unique source of income. 

Thus, they are aware of the importance of sustaining it. Farmers in their farming plan 

stated that they tend to minimize fertilizer use. However, as commented, this is 

followed in order to reduce production cost rather than their commitment with 

environmental aspects of their activities. In relation to the socio-cultural objective, the 

illegal immigration has been shown to be the most important aspect. Contrary to what 

we would expect that the local society would be in favor to immigration (especially to 

European countries and big cities within Senegal) results show that farmers in 

maintaining their activity are recognizing their role in minimizing rural abandonment. 

This could be explained in part by the worldwide economic crisis that is affecting the 

flow of immigrant from underdeveloped countries mainly to Europe.

Despite the homogeneity of the relative weights obtained from AHP, the result of 

cluster analysis shows two distinct groups of farmers. The former are professional 

one with large farm size with more diversified crops and they prioritize their economic 

objective. The other group is formed by few part-time farmers, with small farm size 

and few cultivated crops. In this context, results can be useful as a guide for the 

policy makers of agricultural policy at local level. They suggest that agricultural policy 

should be developed at local level to ensure maximum social welfare assessing 

farmers’ priorities. This perspective, opposed to the view of the agricultural sector as 

primarily a commodities supplier, ought to imply changes making local governments’ 

key actors in the development of rural areas. Therefore, the resulting weights given 

for the different objectives should be considered as insights of farmer’s importance 

regarding the performance of their agricultural system in this specific region. In any 

case, it should be noticed that in order to optimize policy decision-making, other 

related issues need to be attempted, such as the real joint production of commodities 

and non-commodities form agricultural systems and to analyze to any extent non-

commercial functions from agricultural are demanded. In this context, introducing 

farmers’ priorities in the design of agricultural policies is not new. This tendency has 

been confirmed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) through its different 

reforms, increasing the national/regional, even local power of decision makers. The 

results of this study could be regarded supporting the agricultural policy orientation 

based on tools and instruments subject to compliance with a range of environmental, 

food safety and other social functions.
