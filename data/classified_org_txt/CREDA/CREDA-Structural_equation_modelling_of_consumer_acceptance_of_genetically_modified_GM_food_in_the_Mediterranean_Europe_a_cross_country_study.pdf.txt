Abstract 

 

There is some agreement in the food policy literature in that inception of genetic 

modification (GM) techniques in food production conveys both opportunities an risks 

which are found to differ across heterogeneous populations. One of the major 

limitations of previous research on perceptions of risk lies in taking into account food 

values and trust in information sources in a way that causality is accounted for. This 

paper contributes to the literature by examining the behavioural process that drives 

individual’s perceptions to GM food using an empirical choice methodology that 

corrects for endogeneity in decision making relationships, namely Structural Equation 

Modelling. We undertake an empirical application in three specific Mediterranean 

countries, namely Spain, Italy and Greece. Our first major finding indicates that  public 

attitudes toward GM food are being formed from a reasoning mechanism that departs 

from trust in science and in public authorities, ultimately determining consumer’s final 

purchasing decisions. Our second important finding suggests marked differences in the 

reasoning mechanism that lead to the acceptance of GM food in the three countries 

examined.

1. Introduction  

 Acceptance of new science developments, such as new biotechnology 

applications, is a matter of significance interest worldwide and has a huge impact on the 

extent of technology diffusion in key areas such as food production. The inception of 

genetic modification (GM) techniques in food production is envisaged as an opportunity 

to improve food production technologies and/or product differentiation in the food chain 

and ultimately fulfil consumer preferences for diversity. Interestingly, farmers and 

manufacturers perceive potential benefits from efficiency improvements despite some 

associated cost due to the reimbursement of intellectual property rights.  On the other 

hand, public controversy has arisen as a result of the “uncertainties” and perceived 

“risks” – both to health and the environment – that the technology is conveys. 

Consumers perceive GM food as potentially threatening the sustainability of traditional 

food markets that have known for years. As a result, consumers might dread the 

expansion of GM food in supermarkets, and ultimately are said to even refuse to 

consume any product made with this technology.   

 In light of this evidence, a careful understanding of consumer’s reactions 

towards GM food is needed before the introduction of several varieties of GM food into 

European Mediterranean markets. This is especially the case in Spain, Italy and Greece 

where traditional values, such as the Mediterranean diet, contrast with the new claims of 

biotechnology.  For instance,  Spain is the country within Europe with the largest land 

devoted to GM food. In the last year Spain has increased the land devoted to GM food 

up to 75,000 hectares (MAPA, 2007). On the other side, Greece and Italy are two 

countries free of transgenic production (James, 2006). This makes the comparison 

between Spanish, on one hand, and Greek and Italian, on the other hand, very relevant

for the purpose of a better understanding of consumers’ behaviour regarding GM 

products.  

 This study aims to explain the behavioural process and mechanisms that give 

rise to consumer attitudes concerning GM food and, more broadly, new food related 

products with intensive technology innovation by taking into account of endogenous 

relationship between underlying latent variables or social constructs such as trust or 

values .  We do so to tests whether  public attitudes towards GM food are the result of a 

reasoning mechanism that hypothetically departs from trust in institutions and 

ultimately affects final purchase decisions. However, based on previous literature 

(Gaskell et al., 2003; Gaskell et al., 2004; Gaskell et al., 2006 ), this reasoning 

mechanism can slightly differ among consumers of different countries. This study 

employs a Structural Equation Model approach –namely causal models- to provide 

insights into the consumers’ decision-making process in this setting.  

We have structured the paper in five sections.   First, we describe the conceptual 

model and the research questions examined, followed in a second section by the 

specification of the research methodology.  A third section is devoted to the results. 

First it contains some preliminary data analysis, followed by the main results. Finally, 

the paper ends with a concluding section.   

2.  Theoretical framework for Consumers process of GM food acceptance.   

 To better understand the behavioural process underlying GM food consumption 

we have developed a simple conceptual model. The conceptual model presented in this 

study (see Fig.1) is intended to describe the reasoning process that is behind GM food 

acceptance. Briefly, it attempts to isolate and define some of the most influential 

elements in the decision-making process concerning the purchases of GM food – trust 

on scientists and authorities, perceptions towards GM food and attitude formation. 



 5 

Indeed, this study proves part of Chen and Li (2007) framework of consumer’s attitude 

toward GM foods. They state that trust as well as other elements has influence on 

building risk and benefit perceptions. Moreover, these perceptions are responsible on 

defining GM attitudes, mainly benefit perceptions.    

 Furthermore, our underlying conceptual framework is directly related to the 

Theory of Planned Behaviour, which briefly states that “a person’s intention to perform 

(or not), a behaviour is the most important immediate determinant of an action” (Ajzen, 

2005). The main advantage of this theory is that it links individuals’ attitudes with the 

associated valuation of the product by means of behavioural intentions. 

[Insert Figure 1 about here] 

2.1. Trust  

 In the area of GM technology, there is a lack of efficient risk and benefit 

communication due to “scientific uncertainty”. In fact, this uncertainty comes up from a 

wide rage of information sources (Costa-Font and Mossialos, 2007). As a result, 

consumers present different levels of knowledge. Some reveal either rejection or 

acceptance of GM food, based on high levels of “subjective knowledge” (Lusk et a.l, 

2004). Besides, there is a large social group that can be defined as “undecided or 

indifferent”. This group does not have a clear idea of GM food, but is susceptible to 

new information (Onyango et al., 2004; Hossain et al., 2002). Some empirical studies 

have detected this social stratification in both Europe and US (Martinez et al. (2004), 

Noomene & Gil et al. (2004), Schilling (2003), Szczurowska (2005), Vilella-Vila et al. 

(2005) and Gaskell et al. (2003, 2004 & 2006)).   

  Furthermore, the process by which individuals acquire information regarding 

GM food is still not clearly defined. However, some studies suggest that trust is a key 

element on this process (Siegrist et al., 2000; Koivisto Hursti & Magnusson, 2003; 



 6 

Huffman et al., 2004).  Indeed, trust is a matter of confidence on someone or something 

(Siegrist et al., 2000). It is broadly acknowledged, by many empirical studies, as acting 

as a filter of information determining the access of people to information sources 

(Siegrist et al., 2000, Koivisto Hursti & Magnusson, 2003; Huffman et al., 2004).   

Therefore, consumers are likely to believe the opinion of sources that appear to hold 

values similar to themselves (Siegrist, 2000, Cook et al., 2002, Frewer et al., 2003).  

We also consider the importance of consumer perception depending on which 

information sources appears to be the most influential regarding GM technology. 

Indeed, some studies such as Frewer et al. (1996) and Moon & Balasubramanian (2001) 

revealed that U.S. and U.K. consumers considered government and science as the main 

actors regarding GM technology control. Therefore, trust in government and scientists 

are considered to be an important determinant of acceptance of GM food technology 

(Hossain et al., 2003; Hossain & Onyango, 2004; and Onyango, 2004). In order to 

define the construct “trust”, we use questions regarding consumers’ confidence on 

university, industry scientists, and EU institutions.  Overall, confidence on science and 

government regulations is envisaged as determining consumer – both positive and 

negative - perceptions regarding to GM food (Traill et al., 2004; Chen and Li, 2007).  

Therefore, we expect, as explained next, these two variables to be causally related.   

Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:  

H1: Consumers that trust both Scientists and European institutions perceive 

more benefits associated to GM food technology.  

H2: Consumers that trust both Scientists and European institutions perceive 

fewer risks associated to GM food technology.

2.2. Consumer perceptions of risk and benefit about GM food technology.   

Consumer’s perceptions of risk and benefit of a GM product are the result of 

individual evaluations of the product attributes (Fishbein, 1963 and Bredahl et al., 

1998). Currently, consumers perceive more risks than benefits associated to GM 

technology (Moon & Balasubramanian, 2001 & 2004; Grunert et al., 2003; Onyango, 

2004; and Hossain & Onyango, 2004; Costa-Font & Mossialos, 2007), even though, 

risks perceived are not necessarily for real. In the case of GM food technology there is a 

lack of information to allow consumers to develop objective risk estimation (Costa-Font 

and Mossialos, 2007).  This major association of GM food to risky attribute can be 

explained by the fact that consumers trust more environmental groups and consumer 

organizations than governmental institutions and biotech industry researchers (Bredahl 

et al., 1998; Onyango et al., 2003; Savadori et al., 2004; and Veeman et al., 2005).   

Interestingly, some studies such as Siegrist et al., (2000); Fortin & Renton 

(2003), Beech Larsen et al. (2000), Traill et al. (2006) and Costa-Font & Mossialos 

(2007) identify a significant negative relationship among risk and benefits perceptions 

for GM food. Indeed, they state that although benefits associated to GM technology 

exists, consumers do not totally value them since other associated risk exists. This fact 

can be explained, as well, by the “uncertainty” associated to GM technology.  

Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  

H3: Perception of risks associated to GM food technology is negative related 

with perception of benefits associated to GM food technology.

2.3. Consumer attitudes towards GM food  

One of the main theories regarding the formation of consumer attitudes towards 

a product is the Fishbein Multi-attribute Model (Fishbein, 1963). This theory states that 

a consumer attitude is a function of the beliefs that each individual person develops on 

the attributes of a product weighted by an evaluation of each product attribute. This 

model was named by Grunert et al. (2003) the ‘bottom-up’ formation of attitudes.  

Later, Bredahl et al. (1998) developed a more detailed model for the ‘bottom-up’ 

consumer attitude explanation, specifically regarding GM food. This model implies that 

attitudes towards GM food technology are defined by means of a weighted sum of 

attitudes towards each product and its corresponding process.  Moreover, each attitude 

also depends on the overall perceived risks and benefits associated with the product and 

process respectively. 

This theoretical model has been empirically supported by many studies such as 

Moon & Balasubramanian (2001 & 2004); Grunert et al. (2003); Onyango (2004); and 

Hossain & Onyango (2004), which state that acceptance of agri-biotech depends on risk 

and benefit perceptions. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:  

H4: Consumers that perceive more benefits associated to GM food technology 

will have a more positive attitude toward GM food.  

H5: Consumers that perceive more risks associated to GM food technology will 

have a less positive attitude toward GM food.  

 

 

2.4. Consumer final intentions towards GM food.  

An attitude towards a product, such as its acceptance or rejection, is the chief 

aspect that individuals evaluate in its purchasing decision. Two main theories have been 



 9 

used for analysing acceptance and purchase performance behaviour regarding GM 

versus non-GM products. First, Lancaster’s theory of consumer demand (Lancaster, 

1966), which positions consumers utility as a function of product attributes (benefits 

and risks). Otherwise, the Theory of Planned Behaviour states that ’a person’s intention 

to perform, or not, a behaviour is the most important immediate determinant of an 

action’ (Ajzen, 2005). These theories link individuals’ attitudes regarding acceptance or 

rejection of a product with final intentions. Moreover, an important element that makes 

this theory useful for analysing GM purchase intention is perceived behavioural control 

(PBC), which explains intentions with a perceived impediment.  In the case of GM 

versus non-GM food, the impediment is the ’inability to identify GM food’ (Cook et al., 

2002) and the “uncertainty” associated to GM technology.  

 Most studies such as Lusk et al., (2005c); Moon & Balasubramanian, (2003a,b); 

Onyango & Govindasamy, (2004);  Chern et al., (2002); Bredahl (1999), Gifford et al. 

(2005), among others have found evidence that consumers are willing to pay a premium 

for non-GM food. Therefore, consumers place a higher value on non-GM food relative 

to GM food (Lusk et al., 2003). Moreover if new positive information is presented to 

consumers -such as health benefits, environmental benefits or increased shelf-life- their 

attitude can be modified leading to revised final purchase intentions (Moon & 

Balasubramanian, (2003b); Onyango & Govindasamy (2004); Lusk et al. (2004) and 

Lusk et al (2005); Frewer et al. (1996) and  Mucci & Hough (2003)). Although, some 

other studies do not support this change on behaviour (Jaeger et al. (2004), Lusk et al. 

(2002) and Canavari et al. (2005)). Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 

H6: Consumers with a positive attitude towards GM food will present a positive 

intention of consuming GM food.

3. Research Methodology 

The Sample  

We employ microdata from the Eurobarometer survey 58.0 (2002), which 

collected representative data from different European countries. The questionnaire 

contains questions regarding biotechnological applications and it is publicly accessible1. 

We have empirically examined the information for the sub samples of the Spanish, 

Italian and Greek populations in order to gather a detailed picture of their attitudes 

towards GM Food. 

The three subsamples are made of approximately 50% male and 50% women. 

Moreover, the age distribution goes much more the same for the three subsamples,   

approximately 20%  of respondents are between 15-25 years of age, 30 % 26-44, 30% 

45-64 and finally the 20% is of individuals are older than 65 years.  

The initial number for the subsamples was N = 1000 for Spain, N = 992 for Italy 

and N= 1001 for Greece. However, the amounts of missing values due to non responses 

require the application of “list wise deletion” in order to obtain a complete database to 

be analysed. Finally the sample used for the analysis was of N = 314 respondents for 

Spain, N= 330 for Italy and N= 336 for Greece. In the three countries the number of 

cases seems to be adequate since it exceeds 200 cases (Kline, 2005).  

 Measures  

 We have considered, as the literature points out, that responses range from agree 

to disagree going through some uncertainty threshold (Gaskell et al., 2004; Gaskell et 

al., 2006 and O’Connor et al., 2006). Therefore, “don’t know” answers are classified as 

“undecided or indifference” which are accordingly placed somewhere between

 11 

acceptance and rejection (Costa-Font & Mossialos, 2007). All questions about 

perceptions, intentions and trust were measured on a 3-level Liket scale, where “tend to 

agree” responses are codified by an ordinal value of 1, “undecided or indifference” by 2 

and finally, “tend to disagree” by ordinal value 3. Otherwise, questions regarding 

attitudes were measures on a 4-level Likert scale, from “definitely agree” to “definitely 

disagree”. We based our selection of Eurobarometer questions to determine constructs 

on Chen & Li (2007) as shown in Table 1.  

[Insert Table1 about here] 

3.3 Analytical procedures.  

 Structural equation modelling has been used in this study in order to test the 

causal links specified in the theoretical model, what is not possible via regression 

analysis. Indeed, the structural regression (SR) model has been tested following a two-

step modelling approach (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988), where we first define an 

acceptable confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and next an adequate SR model.   

Following Jöreskog & Sörbom (1996), we specified a Structural Equation Model 

which consists of three main types of relationships. First, a measurement model is 

identified after performing confirmatory factor analysis. The outcome relates, on one 

hand, observed indicators with the endogenous latent variables;   

  x = Λ x   ξ + δ   (1) 

where x, is a q × 1 vector of observed exogenous or independent variables, Λ x is a q × n 

matrix of coefficients of the regression of x on ξ, ξ is an n × 1 random vector of latent 

independent variables and δ  is a q × 1 vector of error terms in x. 

 On the other hand, observed indicators are related with the exogenous 

constructs; 

  y   = Λ y   η + ε   (2)  



 12 

where y, is a p × 1 vector of observed endogenous or dependent variables, Λ y is a p × m 

matrix of coefficients of the regression of y  on η, η is an m × 1  random vector of latent 

dependent variables and ε is a p × 1 vector of measurement errors in y.   

 The third equation defines the structural model, which specifies the causal 

relations that exist among the latent variables, describes its causal effects and assigns 

the explained and unexplained variances (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1996). 

  η   = B η + Г ξ + ζ             (3)  

where B is a m × m matrix of coefficients of the η variables in the structural 

relationship, Г is a m × n matrix of coefficients of the ξ - variables in the structural 

relationship, and ζ is a vector of errors.   

 This study uses ordinal data, arguably a rudimentary measurement of continuous 

variables, where the scale is considered as thresholds of the continuous variables 

(Jöreskog, K. & Sörbom, 1996). Correlations among ordinal variables are called 

polychoric and polyserial correlations, which are theoretical correlations of the 

continuous version (Jöreskog, K. & Sörbom, 1996). In order to perform the analysis we 

have used the General Weighted Least-Squares (WLS) method instead of Maximum 

likelihood (ML) since both the data present a nonnormal distribution and because ML 

do not allow us to employ the weight matrix required for the analysis, which is the 

inverse of the estimated asymptotic covariance matrix W of the polychoric and 

polyserial correlations (Kline, 2007).  

F (ө) = ( s – σ)’ W ( s – σ)        (4)    

where s’ is a vector of the elements in the lower half of the covariance matrix S of order 

k × k, σ’ is the vector of corresponding elements of Σ (ө), W -1 is the positive definite 

matrix of order u× u where u = k (k+1)/2. The WLS function is the weighted 

computation of the square residuals (Barrio & Luque, 2000).  



 13 

 Finally, we will assess the goodness-of-fit of the model by analysing factor 

loadings which relate each indicator with the constructs. The composite reliability and 

the extracted validity for each construct will be also measured (Hair et al,.1999). 

Regarding the structural model, its analysis begins with an assessment of the 

significance of the estimated parameters in the structural equations (Hair et al., 1999). 

From then, the reliability coefficient of each equation and the correlation matrix among 

constructs will be examined (Barrio & Luque, 2000). Finally, parameters such as Chi 

square (X2); Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSE); Goodness of Fit Index 

(GFI); the Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI); the Comparative-Fit-Index (CFI); 

the Normed-Fit-Index (NFI) and the Non Normed-Fit-Index (NNFI) will be also 

considered as indicators of the model goodness-of-fit for the CFA and the SR model.  

4. Results  

4.1 Descriptive analysis 

 Before empirically testing the theoretical structural model defined in this study 

we begin by presenting in this section a general cross-country description of evidence 

on Spanish, Italian and Greek behaviour towards GM food. This ultimately will allow 

the reader to better understand the results from the empirical study.  

 When asking about the product utility, risk, moral acceptance and whether to 

encourage GM food technology, respondents are divided on three main groups as also 

stated in previous literature (Gaskell et al., 2004; Hossain et al., 2003). However, the 

percentages of the groups differ among countries (see Fig.2). About 50% of the Spanish 

sample “tends to agree” while the “don’t know” option and “disagreement” options 

represent around 20-30%.  Therefore, about half of Spanish sample considers GM food 

technology to be useful, ethically acceptable, and must be encouraged but also aware of 



 14 

its associated risks. On the contrary, in Greece and Italy more than half of the 

respondents do not consider GM food technology as being useful or ethically acceptable 

and there is no need to be encouraged. Moreover, as in the case of Spain, respondents 

are aware of its associated risks.  

[Insert Figure 3 about here] 

 General perceptions regarding to GM food were analysed on the basis of a set of 

questions that either support or reject a derived utility or a general statement concerning 

GM food. Approximately 40 % of Spanish respondents state that GM food is useful for 

them, for their economy and for the third world. The percentage is significantly higher 

than in the other countries in which this percentage is around 20%. What is common in 

the three countries is that around 20% of the sample has no opinion on this issue.  

Indeed, ignorance is markedly important when asking about the adequacy of GM food 

regulations (30% in Italy and Greece and 40% in Spain). Moreover, the majority of 

respondents consider that current regulations are not enough to protect people from 

GMF risks.  

 Questions revealing higher agreement are those related to personal ability and 

interest in the selection of GM food for consumption purposes. In fact, the majority of 

the population in the three countries revealed ability and they thought that it uses were 

important for them in the judgement and selection of GM food. Paradoxically, most 

respondents consider that it is difficult to perform judgements on GM food. Also for 

these questions the indecision is about 20%. 

 Finally, the last group of questions refer to the purchase or consumption 

intentions. As for this set of questions, there is a clear pattern pointing out towards a 

rejection of GM food purchase intentions. A vast majority of respondents from the three 

countries (more than 80%) refuse to buy GM food whatever the associated benefit, 



 15 

while the remaining 20% is undecided. Lastly, only in Spain there seems to exist a more 

positive outlook if GM food is grown in a more environmental-friendly way.  

5.2 Measurement Model (Confirmatory factor analysis) 

  As mentioned in section 3, the first step of the study has been to carry out a 

confirmatory factor analysis for the whole set of constructs: Trust; benefit perceptions; 

risk perceptions; GM food attitudes and Consumer intention in each country, assuming 

all errors to be uncorrelated. The initial analysis with all indicators resulted suitable for 

the case of Spain but not for Greece and Italy where some indicators were removed 

from the analysis. The correlation matrix among all variables by country is presented in 

Tables 2 to 4. All constructs were measured at least by two indicators as proposed by 

Kline (2005) among others.  

[Insert Tables2-4about here] 

 The main parameters to test for the robustness of the constructs, following Hair 

et al. (1999) and Kline (2005), appear to show acceptable results for the three countries 

as shown in Tables 5. Indeed, reliability of factor loadings are higher for all constructs 

in all countries (above 0.5) and t-values associated with the loadings are all significant 

(P<0.001), implying a satisfactory convergent validity (Olsen, 2003). Two additional 

parameters are important when examining internal consistency of the model, which 

include composite reliability (which must be > 0.7) and extracted validity (which must 

be >0.5) (Hair et al.1999 and Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). For every construct almost all 

composite reliabilities are greater than 0.8 but one, which is 0.73. Regarding the 

variance extracted, all are higher than 0.6 except in the case of Greece where the 

construct perception of benefit presented a extracted validity of 0.57 (Table 5).   

[Insert Table 5 about here] 



 16 

 The generally considered goodness of fit measures for the overall confirmatory 

model indicates that the conceptual model satisfactory fits the data for the case of Spain. 

Alternatively, the model for Italy and Greece requires some additional adjustments on 

the proposed model.  

The fit for the Spanish model is particularly high ( 54.1242 )109( =χ  and 14.1

χ , 

which is smaller than 3 (Carmines & McIver, 1981)). The Root Mean Square Error of 

Approximation (REMSEA) is 0.021, in average which is well under the 0.5-0.8 interval 

offered by Hair et al. (1999) and Kline (2005). The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) was 

0.99, the Comparative-Fit Index (CFI) 1, the Normed-Fit Index (NFI) 0.99 and the Non-

Normed Index (NNI) 0.94, all were greater than 0.90 as offered by Marcoulides & 

Schumacker (1996) and Chen & Li (2007). As for the case of Italy, also all measures 

were adequate ( 67.1492 )80( =χ ; 8.1

df

χ ; REMSEA = 0.05; GFI = 0.99, CFI =0.99, 

NFI = 0.97 and NNI = 0.982). Finally, Greece presents major amendments from the 

conceptual model, with the removal of the construct that value risk perception from the 

model. This modifications have resulted in an adequate goodness-of-fit measures 

( 78.1262 )71( =χ ; 8.1

χ ; REMSEA = 0.048; GFI = 0.99, CFI =0.99, NFI = 0.97 and 

NNI = 0.993).  

Summing up, we have obtained two main patterns among countries. On one hand, in 

Spain and Italy results support the proposed theoretical model, highlighting the role of 

perceived risks and benefits on the construction of attitudes towards GM food.  On the

other, Greek respondents consider that perceived risks are not relevant in this process of 

attitude formation.  

4.2 Structural Model 

Testing the models using a Structural Equation Model demonstrates that a good 

fit has been obtained in Table 6.  Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the path diagrams obtained. 

The estimated paths of the estimated coefficients indicate confirmatory evidence of 

hypothesis H1 and H4 for every country. Therefore, consumers that trust on institutions 

perceive more benefits associated to GM food technology.  The path coefficient for H1 

is relevant for the three countries, 0.32 (t= 5.45), for Spain, 0.24 (t= 4.52), for Italy, and 

0.41 (t= 8.81), for Greece. Moreover, we have found a highly positive significant 

relationship between benefit perception and attitudes towards GM food, with paths of 

almost 1 in the three cases.  This result suggests consumers perceiving benefits 

associated to GM food will generate a more positive attitude towards GM food.  

[Insert Table 6 about here] 

Hypotheses H2, H3, H5 were also confirmed for Spain and Italy. However, it is not 

been possible to test these hypotheses in the case of Greece since the construct 

“perceived risks” (PR) has been previously eliminated from the model. So far, we can 

conclude repeating what we have stated before that there are two main patterns among 

countries, regarding the consumers’ decision process towards acceptance of GM food.  

In Spain and Italy perceived risks are negative related to both trust and perceived 

benefits, that is, consumers that trust institutions perceive fewer risks associated to GM 

food. In addition, the perceptions of high benefits imply the perception of low risks. 

This last statement is supported by the high path coefficients (0.64 (t=11.09), for Spain 

and 0.80 (t=17.25), for Italy). However, hypothesis H5 is not significant in any model 

and therefore is not supported, which contradicts Chen and Li (2007). In other words 



 18 

perceived risks are not relevant in the creation of GM food attitudes. Finally, the three 

models support, with really high path coefficients (>0.9), the last hypothesis, H6. 

Therefore, consumers that reveal positive attitude towards GM food are –consistently 

with the theory of planning behaviour – more likely to buy GM food.       

[Insert Figures 3-5 about here] 

5. Discussion  

 In this paper, we claim that consumer intentions are the result of a complex 

decision-making process that results from a cumulative effect of attitudes, perceptions, 

and trusting information sources. To investigate whether this is the case, it is important 

to disentangle the process that gives rise to such intonations as far as they determine 

further purchase, and ultimately the introduction and diffusion of new technologies. 

This is especially the case of GM food in Spain, Greece, and Italy which all 

paradigmatic countries where we can examine the influence of the set important social 

constrains ( social constructs) affecting behaviour. Given that some of the underlying 

choice dimensions are simultaneously formed and interact with other aspects, traditional 

decision making models that assume parameter exogeneity are not meaningful. To 

overcome this methodological problem we have taken advantage of structural equation  

modelling which allows for endogeneity. This study has implied designing a suitable 

empirical model to carefully understand the process of attitude formation, which defines 

our structural equation to be tested. Our Structural Equation Model assumes that 

perceptions of GM food are expressed both as the interactions of positive and negative 

dimensions, as well as moral concerns. Accordingly, it allows identifying and 

quantifying the underling constrains of revealed decision making.  

 This study employs a large representative subsample of the Eurobarometer 2002 

database. The evidence indicates that acceptance of GM food  rather than being well 



 19 

endowed in peoples attitudes, is still in a very early stage of the behavioural process that 

has both knowledge and time dependent constrains (experience). Therefore, individuals 

still do not reveal to have a clear cut position on the matter. However, this study has 

detected unambiguous cross country difference not only in ultimate attitudes as some 

descriptive evidence has previously shown, but on the underlying behavioural 

processes. Not surprisingly, consumers of GM-free countries, such as Italy and Greece, 

are especially sceptical towards biotechnology applications on the food process.  

Consistently, consumers from “biotech” countries, such as Spain, are more “tolerant” 

towards these applications.   

 To better conceptualise the decision-making process our findings suggest that 

unlike previous studies, perceived risks are not the main factor underpinning attitudes 

and purchase intentions. Interestingly, the later are explained only by perceived benefits. 

Perceived risks seem to only have an effect through perceived benefits (Costa-Font & 

Mossialos, 2007).  Moreover, even this results is heterogeneous as  for Greek 

consumers, risk perception is not a relevant variable in the process at all. Yet, 

consistently with previous literature, social constructs such as trust in relevant 

institutions positively affects perceived benefits and negatively impacts on perceived 

risks. Finally, our findings are in line with the so-called theory of Planed Behaviour 

(Ajzen, 2005). That is, attitudes towards GM food clearly predict purchase intentions, 

almost perfectly. 

 In summary, this paper has attempted to contribute to the existing literature by 

presenting different mechanisms of decision making process for GM food consumption.  

Further research is needed to expand this approach to other European Union countries 

so as to determine the extent to which these results can be generalised to other countries, 

all Europe or, alternatively, are country specific. In this case, research should be 



 20 

conducted in order to determine factors (cultural, influence of mass media, regulations 

and so forth) explaining such differences.
