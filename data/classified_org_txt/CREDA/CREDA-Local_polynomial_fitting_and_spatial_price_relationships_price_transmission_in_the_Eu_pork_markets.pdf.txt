Summary 

We study price transmission processes within EU pork markets after the implementation of 
the EU single market in 1993. We compare results derived from nonparametric regressions 
with those obtained using alternative nonlinear threshold models. Both techniques support 

the hypothesis that prices are transmitted across spatially separate EU pig markets and 
provide evidence for asymmetric price adjustments. They also suggest the existence of a 

range of price differentials where equilibrating price adjustments are less intense. 
Nonparametric techniques often suggest a higher degree of price transmission than that 

implied by threshold models.

1.  Introduction   

The analysis of spatial price relationships has traditionally sought to shed light on spatial aspects 

of the functioning and interaction of localised markets. Various concepts such as spatial 

arbitrage, market integration and market efficiency have been used to describe spatial price 

linkages. Spatial price arbitrage is an equilibrium concept according to which, in a well-

functioning market, transactions between spatially dispersed agents will ensure that price shocks 

occurring in one market evoke responses in other markets. As a result, prices of a homogeneous 

good in two separate locations will differ by, at most, the cost of moving the commodity from 

the cheapest market to the most expensive one. As Fackler and Goodwin (2001) note, the 

arbitrage condition is equivalent to the weak version of the law of one price (LOP). Several 

authors have studied price transmission processes within this framework (e.g. Ardeni, 1989). 

Others have framed their analyses in the context of market integration (Zanias, 1993; Baulch, 

1997). According to Fackler and Goodwin (2001), market integration is usually a measure of the 

degree of price transmission between spatially separate markets, while the concept of efficiency 

is often used to denote a situation in which no opportunities for arbitrage have been left 

unexploited by arbitrageurs.  

 

Our paper studies the spatial arbitrage condition within the EU pork market from the mid-1990s 

to the mid-2000s. A number of applied analyses on spatial price transmission have focused their 

attention on food markets (Goodwin and Piggott, 2001; Zanias, 1993). While most previous 

studies have been based on U.S. (Goodwin and Piggott, 2001) or international data (Dries and 

Unnevehr, 1990), European food markets have received less attention (Zanias, 1993; Gordon, 

Hobbs and Kerr, 1993; Sanjuán and Gil, 2001 are a few exceptions). Additionally, to our 



 3

knowledge, no published study has addressed EU spatial food price relationships after the 

implementation of the Single Market in 1993, which involved the removal of barriers to trade 

within the EU.  

The analysis of spatial price relationships within the EU pork market is considered 

economically relevant for at least three reasons. First, pork is a rather homogeneous good relative 

to other meats such as lamb. Additionally, EU policymakers have intervened less in pig markets 

relative to other markets such as beef or milk. These factors should provide an optimal 

environment for smooth price transmission processes across space. Second, an understanding of 

spatial price linkages is important because the structure of the pig industry has changed at an 

unprecedented rate since the 1990s, resulting in higher levels of concentration. These structural 

changes could have had an influence on the degree to which price shocks are regionally 

transmitted. Third, the EU meat sector has been seriously affected by major veterinary crises 

throughout the period of study (the BSE crisis, the swine fever epidemic, and the foot and mouth 

disease outbreak). These animal disease episodes have had important impacts on both supply and 

demand for meat products and have triggered various policy interventions such as trade  bans or 

the removal of animals from the market. These episodes are thus very likely to have had an 

impact on price transmission processes. Although Sanjuán and Gil (2001) studied cointegration 

relationships between prices taken at different EU pork markets in the period that goes from the 

end of the 1980s to the mid 1990s, the changes experienced by the sector afterwards, as well as 

the recently introduced methodological refinements, make it interesting to update the analyses in 

order to better understand the current workings of EU pig markets.   

In order to study the issue of spatial price transmission empirically, a series of analytical 

methods have been devised. Given the usual nonstationary nature of price data, recent 



 4

contributions have underlined the need to use econometric techniques adequate for dealing with 

nonstationary and cointegrated data. A current issue is the possibly nonlinear nature of spatial 

price relationships that has been often attributed to a lack of perfect arbitrage resulting from 

transactions costs and uncertainty. Nonlinearities appear whenever price dynamics differ across 

regimes (e.g. when asymmetries characterise price adjustments). Nonlinear price responses are 

symmetric when a shock to a certain price elicits the same response to other prices regardless of 

the direction of the shock, or asymmetric otherwise. Previous research has identified several 

causes of asymmetries that may be relevant to the EU pork market (see section 2). We test for 

the presence of asymmetries in spatial price relationships. In this regard, our analysis represents a 

contribution to the literature, as no previous published study has made an allowance for 

asymmetries or for nonlinearities in regional food price transmission processes within the EU. 

Several econometric procedures have been proposed to capture nonlinear price relationships. 

Recently, Chavas and Metha (2004) suggested an extended error correction model that allows 

price dynamics to differ across regimes. While these authors treat regime switching as 

exogenous, more general models of asymmetry such as threshold autoregressive (TAR) models 

(Obstfeld and Taylor, 1997; Goodwin and Grennes, 1998; Goodwin and Piggott, 2001), or 

threshold vector error correction (TVECM) models (Lo and Zivot, 2001; Goodwin and Piggott, 

2001) incorporate this issue as endogenous. All these parametric approaches have in common the 

fact that they model nonlinearities by using a limited number of variables and their associated 

parameters. Parametric approaches to modelling price relationships require assumptions about 

the true nature of price behaviour that may be too restrictive or unrealistic. In threshold models, 

for example, two regimes are usually specified - one that pertains to price relationships under 

trade and another that holds when price differences are too small for profitable trade to occur. 



 5

The transition from one regime to another is assumed to be sharp and discontinuous, involving 

price differentials that motivate individuals to undertake arbitrage activities and/or adjust prices 

that are common across economic agents. This assumption may be valid if transaction costs and 

uncertainties are homogeneous across different individuals, but may be too restrictive otherwise. 

Models smoothed using the approach of Teräsvirta (1994) partially overcome this limitation by 

allowing for gradual adjustments between regimes.1 However, in that they are parametric, they 

still have the potential for specification biases as a result of inappropriate parametric 

assumptions.  

 Contrary to parametric models, nonparametric techniques such as local polynomial 

modelling (Fan and Gijbels, 1996) do not require any assumption about the functional form 

characterising price behaviour. They are especially useful for situations in which a suitable 

parametric form of the regression surface is unknown. In that they are data-driven methods, it is 

the data that inform and determine the shape of the relationship among the variables. 

Nonparametric models have the advantage of essentially ‘nesting’ parametric alternatives. For 

example, the nonlinear pattern of adjustment implied by a threshold model can be compared to 

the patterns implied by nonparametric models. To the extent that the implied patterns of 

adjustment differ substantially across techniques, one may question the appropriateness of the 

parametric threshold model. It is also important to point out that our approach is robust to bi-

directional patterns of trade in that no restrictions (or assumptions) are imposed with regard to 

the symmetry of responses or relative sizes of transactions costs from moving in one direction 

                                                 
1 Smooth transition regressions may be seen as a generalisation of other parametric approaches used to model 

nonlinearities in the data such as the TAR models or the nonlinear error correction models introduced by Escribano 

(1986) (see Escribano and Mira, 2002; or Teräsvirta and Eliassen, 2001).

relative to another. Our methods are also robust to the possibility of asymmetric adjustments that 

occur for other reasons as well as to misspecifications due to structural breaks.  

To date, the use of nonparametric techniques to study nonlinear aspects of price 

transmission has been very limited (see Mancuso, Goodwin and Grennes, 2003; Barrett and Li, 

2002; or Serra, Goodwin and Mancuso, 2005 for a few exceptions). In this article we assess price 

transmission relationships among EU pork markets by employing nonlinear methods of analysis. 

To our knowledge, no previous study has applied these techniques to a consideration of spatial 

price transmission within EU food markets. To do so, we first test for the weak version of the 

law of one price by using local polynomial modelling techniques. Results are then used to guide 

the specification of parametric threshold autoregressive models. We next compare the results 

derived using flexible nonparametric techniques to those obtained from the more restrictive 

parametric TAR models. Although both techniques yield similar qualitative results, important 

differences arise in the nature of price linkages. 

 This article is organised as follows. In the next section, the main characteristics of the EU 

pig sector are presented. The methodology section describes both the parametric and 

nonparametric techniques employed to characterise the nature of price transmission. The 

empirical implementation section presents a description of the data used and a discussion of the 

results. Concluding remarks are presented in the last section.  

 

2. The main characteristics of the EU pork sector 

The EU-15 occupies a prominent position in world rankings of pork production and trade. It is 

the world’s second largest pig producer after China and is followed, at a distance, by the USA. 



 7

EU pork production capacity is consistently above 100 per cent (almost 107 per cent in 2003) 2, 

which explains the strong export orientation of this sector especially in some countries such as 

Denmark. Although there are relevant pork trade flows with non-EU member countries, the most 

intensive trade flows occur within the EU-15. In 2002, for example, intra-EU pork trade 

accounted for 2.7 million tons, while exports to and imports from countries outside EU-15 were 

in the order of 1.2 million and 51,000 tons respectively. Pork production represents around 8 per 

cent of the EU gross agricultural product. Germany, Spain, France and Denmark are the four top 

EU-15 pork producers. Most pork is produced under intensive farming systems, which generally 

reduce heterogeneity across countries. In spite of this, there exist relevant differences in average 

carcass weight preferences across EU member states: while some exceptions occur, north-central 

Europe has a preference for heavy carcasses whereas southern Europe chooses lighter 

deadweights.  

 Our analysis of pork price transmission focuses on the four leading EU pork producers: 

Germany, Spain, France and Denmark, which represent more than 60 per cent of net pork output. 

While Germany and France produce carcasses above the EU average weight (around 87-88 kg), 

Spain and Denmark opt for lighter animals. As is shown in Table 1, however, these differences 

in production do not inhibit trade flows. The four countries studied represent a conspicuous part 

of intra EU trade, with Germany being the largest importer and Denmark a leading exporter. 

There are bilateral trade flows between the four countries studied. In 1995, for example, German 

pork exports to Denmark, Spain and France represented almost 20 per cent of Germany’s pork 

exports to EU countries. Additionally, Table 1 shows an increase in exports between the four 

countries between 1995 and 2003. With the exception of Germany, imports among the four

countries have also increased, and imports within the group also represent a relevant portion of 

total intra EU imports.  

Table 1 here 

 Our study allows for nonlinearities thus recognising that, although prices may have a 

tendency to move towards a long-run equilibrium, actual movement towards this equilibrium 

may not occur in every period. Transaction costs or market imperfections can lead to nonlinear 

and asymmetric price adjustments. The economic literature has identified several theoretical 

reasons that may bring about asymmetries (Meyer and von Cramon-Taubadel, 2004), and that 

may be relevant to the understanding of price transmission processes within the EU market. First, 

trade flows between two markets tend to occur primarily in one direction. Denmark, for example, 

is a net exporter of pigmeat, with Germany being the largest EU importer. According to previous 

research this may cause asymmetric price adjustments (Goodwin and Piggott, 2001). Market 

power can be a second source of asymmetries. As Abdulai (2000) noted, if middlemen have 

market power, they may react more quickly to shocks involving a reduction in their marketing 

margins than to shocks increasing them. In the past decade the EU pig industry has undergone 

major structural changes. Although the family farm still plays an important role, there has been a 

considerable increase in the number of corporate units, which are usually vertically integrated. 

Structural changes have resulted in a considerable increase in concentration. While the total pig 

numbers increased from 121,5 to 121,95 million head during the period 1993-97, the average 

herd size increased from 78 to 105.8 pigs per holding. Structural changes were more accentuated 

in countries such as Spain or Germany, where the average herd size more than doubled, or in 

France or Denmark which experienced increases on the order of 80 per cent. Increased 

concentration may yield market power and result in nonlinearities in price transmission

processes. Third, inventory management strategies or policies that insulate markets may also 

prevent full price transmission and motivate nonlinearities (Blinder, 1982; Wohlgenant, 1985; 

Kinnucan and Forker, 1987). In this regard, the relevant animal disease episodes that afflicted the 

EU meat sector since the mid-1990s could have caused nonlinearities in spatial price 

transmission processes. In any case, they are likely to have altered price transmission patterns by 

changing both the supply and demand for meat and triggering policy interventions such as 

import/export bans and the removal of animals from the market.  

 

3. Methodology 

3.1 General remarks 
 
Price transmission studies are usually based upon empirical exercises that test predictions 

derived from economic theory3 and show how quickly and to what extent price differentials (net 

of transactions costs) between two spatially distant markets are eliminated (Obstfeld and Taylor, 

1997). Various quantitative techniques have been applied for such purpose. Early analyses, 

which typically used correlation and simple regression analyses, have been criticised for not 

recognising the usual nonstationary nature of price data (McNew and Fackler, 1997; Fackler and 

Goodwin, 2001, Barrett, 1996). More recent studies have addressed inferential problems 

associated with nonstationarity by adopting time series techniques adequate for dealing with 

nonstationary and cointegrated data (Goodwin and Schroeder, 1991). However, regression and 

                                                 
3 Many of the spatial price relationship tests that have been proposed in the literature can be economically justified 

through the point-location model (Fackler and Goodwin; 2001), which represents the equilibrium conditions 

inherent in the Law of One Price.

cointegration-based tests suffer from a common limitation: they do not account for transaction 

costs (McNew and Fackler, 1997; Barrett, 1996).  

 Transaction costs cover the costs of all factors associated with spatial trade and arbitrage. 

In addition to transportation charges and freight charges, transaction costs may include risk 

premia, information-gathering costs, negotiation costs, spoilage, theft, or the costs of maintaining 

a presence in a regional market. An analogous form of transaction costs may be associated with 

the exchange of commodities over time – in other words, storage.  In this case, the relevant 

comparison involves prices today and prices at some point in the future and the relevant costs are 

those associated with storage. In this analysis, we focus exclusively on spatial arbitrage and 

trade, and thus consider price linkages in the spatial dimension. As noted, the presence of 

transaction costs may result in nonlinear spatial price relationships (Heckscher, 1916). This 

occurs because price relationships may involve a combination of different “regimes,” 

corresponding to different trade/no-trade conditions. 

Recently, there have been two major developments in the methods used to allow for 

transaction costs: the parity bounds model (PBM) and threshold cointegration tests. The PBM 

compares the observed regional price differentials against exogenously predicted transaction 

costs. It usually distinguishes among three different price regimes: where spatial price 

differentials are equal, above or below transaction costs (Baulch 1997), and estimates the 

probability of being in each regime. PBM has however been criticised on the ground that, 

contrary to threshold cointegration, it is based on static comparisons and thus it does not allow 

price dynamics to be studied (see Fackler, 1996 for more detail). Also, the PBM requires 

information on transaction costs, which are usually partially or totally unobservable.  



 11

Threshold cointegration models, which we use in our analysis, do not require 

observations on transaction costs. They are based upon the idea that these costs create a neutral 

band where spatial price links are weak or even non-existent, because price differentials do not 

exceed transaction costs thus making spatial arbitrage unprofitable. If price differentials exceed 

these costs, they do not persist but are rather driven back to transaction costs through the 

equilibrating adjustments caused by profit-seeking activities of spatial trade. This nonlinear 

pattern of price adjustment is represented through a combination of different regimes. Threshold 

cointegration methods are based upon Tong (1978), who introduced nonlinear threshold time 

series models, and Tsay (1989), who developed a method to model threshold autoregressive 

processes. Balke and Fomby (1997) extended the threshold autoregressive models to a 

cointegration framework. They considered a model where there is a discontinuous adjustment to 

a long-run equilibrium. Specifically, the equilibrium error follows mean-reverting threshold 

autoregressions outside a given range, while having a unit root inside the range. To estimate 

these models, Balke and Fomby (1997) suggest a two-step approach whereby threshold 

parameters are chosen through a grid search that minimises a sum of squared errors (SSE) 

criterion. In this paper, we follow the proposal by Balke and Fomby (1997). 

The literature review presented above reveals that analyses of price transmission have 

typically been based on parametric approaches. These approaches possibly make assumptions 

about the true nature of price transmission that are both too strong and inadequate. Because 

nonparametric techniques do not require any preliminary assumptions about the nature of price 

behaviour, we are also interested in applying these techniques to a characterisation of spatial 

price relationships and in comparing the results with those arising from alternative parametric 



 12

TAR models. We now present details on both the nonparametric and parametric techniques 

utilised in this paper. 

 

3.2 Local polynomial fitting 
 
Locally weighted regression techniques, which consist of locally approximating a polynomial 

regression function, have been thoroughly studied in the literature (Cleveland, 1979; Cleveland, 

Devlin and Grosse, 1988; Fan, 1992; or Fan and Gijbels, 1995). In our application, we use local 

polynomial fitting techniques to estimate a nonparametric version of a threshold autoregressive 

model of spatial price differentials (i.e., differences in contemporaneous prices at two different 

locations). These models have been widely used to assess spatial price transmission (Obstfeld 

and Taylor, 1997; Goodwin and Grennes, 1998; Goodwin and Piggott, 2001).  

Consider a series of scatter points 1( , )t tX Y  where t=1,…,n from a population 1( , )X Y , 

where 1 1( ) ( )      t t it jt it jtY X P P P P  represents the adjustment in regional price differentials 

in period t , being itP  and jtP  the prices of a certain commodity in two spatially separate markets 

( i  and j ), and 1 1 1( )t it jtX P P     is the value of the regional price differential in the previous 

period 1t  . It is assumed that data are generated from a model  1  Y m X , where 

  0 E , and m  is a smooth function differentiable at  1X . The basic idea behind local fitting 

is to use those observations 1( , )t tX Y  relatively close to a given point kx  to estimate function m  

at that point, i.e. ˆ ( )km x . To estimate the whole function  1m̂ X  , the process is then repeated for 

a number of grid values of 1X . The unknown function may be approximated through a Taylor 

series expansion that models ( )m x  locally by a simple polynomial model:

Heij et al. (2004: 292), the selection of a polynomial of order 1p  is recommended in most 

cases and leads to the local linear regression estimator (LLRE).  

The local approximation is more accurate for values of 1tX  that are closer to kx  

compared with more distant points. This motivates the use of weighted least squares to estimate 

parameters  j , in order to exclude those observations that are too distant from kx  and weight the 

non-excluded observations (the neighbourhood of kx ) according to their distance from kx :

where kh , the bandwidth, and K , the kernel function, are described in the following lines. The 

selection of the neighbourhood of kx  to be used in the estimation is done through the bandwidth 

kh , which determines the maximum distance of 1tX  from kx  for 1tX  to be included in the local 

estimation. As Fan and Gijbels (1996, chapter 3) note, the bandwidth parameter has an important 

influence on the results. While a large bandwidth can cause a large modelling bias by under-

parameterising the regression, an excessively small bandwidth can result in noisy estimates. We 

selected an optimum constant bandwidth ( kh h ) using the cross-validation technique. This 

widely used technique (Fan and Gijbels, 1996) chooses h  to minimise the squared prediction 

error:  2

parameter h . For each observation t, the estimate t̂Y  is obtained by computing the regression 

function without the t-th observation and predicting tY . The model is then validated by 

examining the prediction error. In our application and following previous research (Mancuso, 

Goodwin and Grennes, 2003), the predicted value for tY  was obtained using the Nadaraya-

Watson4 nonparametric regression estimator (Fan and Gijbels 1996: 14-15). The minimisation 

process requires the computation of the squared prediction error at different bandwidth 

gridpoints. We searched for the bandwidth h  over the range 0.1-2 standard deviations of the 

independent variable 1tX  . 

After selecting the neighbourhood of kx , the weighting of the observations included in 

the estimation was done through the kernel function K , which has a support contained in  -1,1  

and whose role is to down-weigh the contribution of those observations away from kx . The 

Epanechnikov kernel was used, which is shown by Fan and Gijbels (1996, chapter 3) to be an 

optimal weight function. The solution to the problem in expression (1) is given by (see Fan and 

Gijbels 1996: 94-95):

4 The Nadaraya-Watson estimator speeds up the estimation of the LLRE, since it is less computationally intensive 

than the estimator in (1).  



 15

 Local polynomial fitting techniques are especially useful in situations for which a suitable 

parametric form of the regression surface is unknown. As noted by Fan (2000), nonparametric 

techniques allow one to search for appropriate nonlinear forms that best describe the available 

data, which allows one to reduce the possible modelling biases of parametric techniques. Hence, 

a local linear regression was fitted to our data before proceeding to the parametric approach, in 

order to guide the specification of the TAR model. As we discuss in section 4, the nonparametric 

results suggest that price relationships may be adequately characterised by a three-regime TAR, 

with a central band of relatively slow price adjustments and outside bands of a relatively fast 

adjustment.  

 

3.3 Threshold Autoregressive Models 

Our parametric estimation approach can be summarised as follows. First, we evaluated the time 

series properties of the data using unit root and cointegration tests. Unit root tests can be 

seriously distorted by structural changes in the time series (Zivot and Andrews, 1992; or Perron, 

1997). Figure 1 suggests that our price series may be affected by such changes. In order to 

determine whether price series are nonstationary or whether the apparent nonstationarity is due 

to a structural break, we used Perron’s (1997) sequential test.5 Second, cointegration among 

prices was tested using the Johansen (1988) test.6 In order to capture spatial price dynamics we 

then estimated a threshold autoregressive model as described in the following paragraphs.7 

                                                 
5 The truncation lag parameter is selected using the general to specific recursive method (Perron, 1997). 

6 The lag length of the vector autoregressive model was selected to ensure non-autocorrelation of the residuals and 

to minimise the AIC criterion. The deterministic terms of the test were selected according to the LOP. 

7 As a suggestion of an anonymous referee, a Momentum-TAR (MTAR) model was also considered. However, TAR 

models were found to bear more resemblance to the nonparametric regressions of price differentials than MTARs. 



 16

A simple autoregressive model (AR) of price differentials can be represented 

as: 1t t tY X e   , where, as noted, tY  is the adjustment in regional price differentials in period t, 

1tX  is the value of the regional price differentials in the previous period 1t  , and te  is a white 

noise error term. Usually, analyses of spatial price behaviour take the magnitude of regional 

price differentials  1tX   as the variable that determines regime-switching (Serra and Goodwin, 

2004; Mancuso, Goodwin, and Grennes, 2003). Different regimes are represented by different 

values of the parameter  . A three-regime TAR was estimated to allow for asymmetries in price 

behaviour:

where 1c  and 2c represent threshold parameters that define the regimes.  The TAR model can be 

estimated using sequential iterated least squares regression in two steps (see Balke and Fomby, 

1997). The aim of the first step is to estimate threshold parameters 1c  and 2c  through a grid 

search. The first or lower threshold was identified by searching over the space defined by the 

minimum and the median of the lagged price differentials, while the upper threshold was 

identified after searching over the range that goes from the median to the maximum value of the 

lagged price differentials. These searches were restricted in order to ensure an adequate number 

of observations in each regime. For a given pair  1 2,c c , (1) , (2) , and (3)  can be determined 

                                                                                                                                                             
Following Fan’s (2000) recommendation to use nonparametric results to enhance the parametric analysis, we have 

chosen to use TAR models.

TAR was estimated and tested against a standard AR model.  

 

4. Empirical Implementation 

To assess price transmission processes between EU pork markets, weekly producer prices, 

expressed in Euro/100 kg, for Germany, Spain, France, and Denmark over the period 1994-2004 

were used. Prices were obtained from the European Commission’s publication Agricultural 

Markets - Prices.  

Figure 1 here 

Figure 1 shows that these countries’ price series follow very similar patterns, implying important 

price transmission processes across EU markets. The graphs also suggest three main peaks for all 

price series in 1996, 1997, and 2001 that coincide with the three important animal disease 



 18

outbreaks that affected the EU meat sector in the period studied: first, the 1996 official 

announcement that BSE can cause Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which involved an 

important shift in meat demand from beef to pork; second, the 1997-98 classical swine fever 

epidemic in the Netherlands, which involved the removal of millions of pigs from the market just 

as demand for pork was rising as a result of BSE concerns; and third, the foot and mouth disease 

in the UK, which caused a switch from beef to pork.  

In light of its nonparametric nature, the local linear regression method is best interpreted 

by graphical representation, which favours relatively simple model specifications. We opted for 

pair-wise analyses. Pair-wise analyses are very common in the price transmission literature and 

are a natural choice for studying price linkages since arbitrage conditions, which imply 

integration, should hold for any pair of prices. Goodwin and Piggott (2001) suggested defining 

pairs of prices consisting of a central market price ( itP ) and another market price ( jtP ), where the 

central market is the largest market in terms of volume.8 In our analysis, Germany plays this role 

as it is the most populated EU-15 country, the largest importer of pigmeat, a relevant exporter 

and has one of the highest per capita consumption levels of pork. A market with these 

characteristics would be expected to lead price formation. Weak exogeneity tests presented in 

Table 2 confirm this hypothesis.9 For each pair of prices, a local linear regression was fitted. 

Results10 are presented in Figures 2 to 4 where, for comparison, the predicted values of the TAR 

models are also included.  

                                                 
8 Prices are in levels. The analysis was replicated using prices in logs and the results were very similar. 

9 Other studies have also provided evidence of the relevance of consumer markets (or net importer markets) in price 

formation processes relative to producer markets (Serra and Goodwin, 2004). 

10 As explained in the methodology section, the bandwidth used in the local linear regression technique is searched 

between 0.1 and 2 standard deviations of the independent variable using the cross-validation technique. The 



 19

Nonparametric results suggest that deviations from long-run equilibrium relationships 

tend to be arbitraged away in a nonlinear fashion. Specifically, they suggest the existence of a 

central neutral band or area of price differentials of relatively slow price adjustments and outside 

bands of quicker price movements. The fact that out-of-band adjustments are not symmetric 

suggests the presence of asymmetries in the process of price adjustment. Within each regime or 

band, price dynamics seem to follow a linear pattern. This suggests that price relationships may 

be adequately characterised by a three-regime TAR, which we estimated.11 

Table 2 here 

Now shifting to the parametric analysis, Table 2 presents test statistics that evaluate the 

time series properties of the data. The sequential modality of the Perron (1997) test that allows 

for both a change in the intercept and the slope12 suggests that the null hypothesis of a unit root 

cannot be rejected for any series. It is interesting to note that all selected breakpoints coincide 

with the classical swine fever outbreak in 1997 that involved the removal of millions of pigs 

                                                                                                                                                             
optimum result of the grid search is 1.1, 1.5, 1.9h  for the Spain-Germany, France-Germany, and Denmark-

Germany models respectively. It should be noted here that the corrected Akaike information criteria (Hurvich and 

Simonoff, 1998) was also used as an alternative method for bandwidth selection and the results derived were very 

similar. 

11 As a suggestion of an anonymous referee, we also estimated a TVECM for each pair of prices. Results, which are 

available upon request, do not substantially differ from the ones derived from TAR models.  

12 Results for the other modalities of the test are not presented, but are available upon request. These results do not 

differ however from the ones offered here.

from the market at a time when demand was strongly growing. Johansen tests provide evidence 

of stationary linear long-run relationships among all pairs of prices.13   

Table 3 here 

Results derived from the estimation of the threshold autoregressive models are presented 

in Table 3. While a three-regime TAR was statistically significant against an AR model for 

Germany-Denmark and Germany-France pairs of prices, price relationships between Germany 

and Spain were best captured by a two-regime TAR. Hence, asymmetries characterise price 

transmission processes between Germany and France and Denmark, while a symmetric 

relationship best represents the Germany-Spain price linkage. In-band parameter estimates are 

not statistically different from zero, which is consistent with the existence of transaction costs 

that cause price adjustments to take place only after price differentials exceed a certain minimum 

amount. Out-of-band parameters are all negative and significantly different from zero, 

suggesting that price differentials exceeding threshold values are arbitraged away. The three-

regime TAR models suggest that asymmetries grant a certain advantage to Germany over 

Denmark and France; while negative price differentials are quickly adjusted, positive price 

differentials are corrected more slowly. In contrast, the two-regime TAR shows that price 

transmission processes leave Spain on equal terms with Germany: the out-of-band adjustment 

has the same speed independent of whether price differentials are positive or negative. The 

advantage of Germany over France and Denmark but not over Spain, might be explained both by 

the greater physical distance between Spain and Germany, which could reduce trade flows, and 

                                                 
13 As a suggestion of an anonymous referee we tested for structural changes in the cointegrated autoregressive 

models following Hansen and Johansen (1999). Results, which are available upon request, suggest stability of 

parameter estimates throughout the period studied. 



 21

by the fact that both Germany and Spain are the leading EU pork producers and thus can 

compete under more similar conditions.  

We find transaction cost bands to be the largest for the Germany-Denmark model. While 

Denmark is a leading EU pork exporter, Germany is the primary importer. Hence, prices in 

Germany probably carry a significant transaction cost charge not present in Danish prices. Thus, 

transaction cost bands are expected to be wider between an exporter and an importing country, 

than between two importing markets. Consistent with this hypothesis, transaction costs between 

France (which, as Germany, has a negative balance in the intra-EU pork trade) and Germany are 

considerably below the transaction cost band derived in the Germany-Denmark model. Spain has 

a positive balance in the intra-EU pork trade, being thus a net exporter. The transaction cost band 

for the Germany-Spain model is unexpectedly small. This could be explained by a less intensive 

commercial flow between Germany and Spain relative to the trade between Denmark and 

Germany, which may reduce the adequacy of the interpretation of the thresholds as transaction 

costs band (Goodwin, Grennes and Craig, 2002).  

 Direct comparison between parametric and nonparametric techniques (Figures 2-4) 

suggests that both techniques support the hypothesis that prices are transmitted across spatially 

separate EU pig markets. Additionally, both models suggest that there exists a range of price 

differentials where equilibrating price adjustments may be less intense, which is compatible with 

transaction costs. In spite of the similarities between the two models, important differences arise. 

First, because local linear regression techniques do not assume homogeneous transaction costs 

across individuals, the transition from one regime to another is allowed to be smooth, which 

contrasts with the sharp and discontinuous transitions implied by the parametric techniques. A 

second difference is apparent between the parametric within-band price behaviour and the 



 22

analogous values predicted by the nonparametric techniques. Where TAR models suggest a 

market in equilibrium, local polynomial fitting shows that a price adjustment takes place. 

Furthermore, this adjustment can be relatively quick, as is the case with the Germany-France 

model. Hence, the LLRE implies that markets are more strongly interconnected than what one 

would conclude from simple observation of the TAR model. This is compatible with Mancuso, 

Goodwin and Grennes (2003) and Serra, Goodwin and Mancuso (2005). 

 Third, nonparametric techniques suggest that TAR models, in that they are estimated with 

a limited number of regimes, may have difficulty in capturing the true nature of price 

relationships. Though the true nature of the price transmission is unknown, nonparametric 

techniques, in that they are more flexible and do not carry the potential for specification biases as 

a result of an inappropriate parametric assumption, are expected to represent true price linkages 

better. In the Germany-Spain model, for example, big positive price differentials above €15, 

accelerate the speed of price adjustment. This acceleration is not captured by the parametric 

method, suggesting that another regime might be necessary if the TAR is to correctly represent 

true price relationships. However, a three-regime TAR for this pair of markets was estimated and 

rejected against a linear AR. Following the same argument and as a general rule, for big positive 

price differentials the speed of price adjustment suggested by parametric models is slower than 

that derived from the LLR. Conversely, for negative differentials, the slope of the TAR 

regression is steeper than (or coincides with) the nonparametric one.  

 

5. Concluding Remarks  

The economic literature on price transmission has argued that spatial price adjustments may only 

take place when regional price differentials exceed a certain minimum amount. These frictions 



 23

reflect the presence of transaction costs, imperfect information and other barriers to arbitrage. 

Threshold parametric models have been widely used to capture nonlinear price adjustments. We 

argue that these techniques may involve too restrictive or unrealistic assumptions about the true 

nature of price behaviour and thus that nonparametric techniques such as local polynomial fitting 

may offer significant advantages. Additionally, nonparametric methods are especially useful in 

those situations in which a suitable parametric form of the regression surface is unknown. The 

use of nonparametric techniques to guide the specification of the parametric model may reduce 

the likelihood of model biases.  

 We used nonparametric methods to analyse price transmission within EU pork markets 

for the period 1994 to 2004. We used weekly, country-level price series for Germany, Spain, 

France, and Denmark, representing the four leading EU pork producers and traders. Results 

obtained with nonparametric techniques (LLR) and more restrictive parametric threshold models 

(TAR) were compared. Both methodologies suggest that EU pork markets are interrelated in that 

price shocks are spatially transmitted. However, LLR techniques often suggest a higher degree of 

price transmission than that implied by TAR models. Specifically, while TAR models support 

the existence of a band of price differentials within which no adjustment takes place, LLR results 

imply price adjustments even within thresholds, albeit at different rates. Hence, according to the 

LLR, markets are more strongly interconnected either through information or trade flows. Also, 

TAR models seem to have difficulty in capturing the true speed of price changes for out-of-band 

price differentials. Whereas an increase in out-of-band price differentials changes the slope of the 

nonparametric regression to make transmission processes quicker, TAR models assume the 

speed of adjustment is constant.  



 24

 Both methodologies suggest that price transmission processes between Germany and 

Denmark and France are asymmetric and grant a certain advantage to Germany. They also imply 

that price relationships between the two leading EU pork producers (Spain and Germany) are 

symmetric and leave these two countries more on equal terms. Whereas negative price 

differentials between Germany and Denmark or France are quickly corrected, and positive price 

differentials are arbitraged away at a slower path, the out-of-band adjustment for the Germany-

Spain model has the same speed independently of the sign of the price differentials. 

 These results might be explained by the larger physical distance between Spain and 

Germany and by the traditionally less intensive trade flow relative to those between the latter 

country and Denmark or, to a lesser extent, France. Moreover, both Germany and Spain are 

leading pork producers, which allow them to compete more on equal terms. Another interesting 

result, from our perspective, is that transaction costs bands are wider when we look at price 

transmission between the largest importing and exporting countries. This indicates that in the 

importing country, pig prices include larger transaction costs than in the exporting country. 

 Obviously, the interpretation of our results has to be restricted to the pig sector and the 

sample period analysed. In this sense, further research is needed. Apart from applying new 

methodological refinements, which, with no doubt, will appear in coming years, this study 

should be extended to other meat sectors in Europe with two main objectives. The first one 

would be to try and replicate our findings relating distances, trade flows, transaction costs and 

spatial price transmission. Second, as different meat sectors are supported with different degrees 

of market intervention, comparing results from new studies could provide valuable information 

about the potential impact of policy measures on spatial price transmission.
