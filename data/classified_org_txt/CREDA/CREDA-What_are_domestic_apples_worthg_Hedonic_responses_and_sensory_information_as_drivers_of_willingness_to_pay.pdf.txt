Abstract 6 

The effects of written information of key sensory characteristics of apple cultivars on 7 

hedonic ratings and willingness to pay (WTP) were measured in an experimental auction. 8 

Participants (n=118, 95F, 23M, mean age 37 y.) rated, in three subsequent rounds, 9 

pleasantness and WTP based on 1) appearance only (n=25), 2) appearance, written 10 

information and tasting (n=44), or 3) appearance, tasting and written information (n=49). 11 

Four domestic cultivars were described as medium sour & crispy (‘Amorosa’), sour & 12 

medium crispy (‘Konsta’), medium sweet & medium crispy (‘Lobo’) and sweet & medium 13 

crispy (‘Tobias’). The differences between the cultivars in pleasantness and WTP were 14 

minimal when the evaluation was based on appearance only. The effect of tasting after 15 

visual inspection was positive in three cultivars and negative in one (‘Konsta’). Written 16 

information after tasting did not affect pleasantness or WTP. For one cultivar (‘Tobias’), 17 

information given before tasting created expectations that were not fulfilled, thus tasting 18 

decreased hedonic ratings and WTP. Mean WTP was 2.36 euro/kg. When pleasantness 19 

increased by one point, WTP increased by 0.31-0.45 euro/kg. Regression models showed 20 

that pleasantness explained 38-55% of WTP. Respondents who reported consuming 21 

domestic apples more often than once a week had 0.52-0.74 euro/kg higher WTP than those 22 

who consumed them less frequently, suggesting that familiarity with the product increases 23 

WTP. Results indicate that both written information and tasting contribute to the ratings of 24 

pleasantness and WTP.  25

1 Introduction 27 

Producers, industry and retail sector strive to create added value for their products within a 28 

category and capture attention from new customer segments. In this setting, locally 29 

produced foods have gained attention. Grebitus, Lusk, & Nayga (2013) showed that 30 

respondents considered local apples to be fresher, tastier and safer than non-local apples. 31 

According to Jaeger et al. (2011), horticultural markets are highly competitive and 32 

characterised by numerous poorly differentiated and low-priced products. This is the case 33 

also in Finland. Domestic apples are seasonal products and poorly differentiated or branded 34 

in retail stores, and imported apples of good quality are often sold at a low price (1–2 35 

euro/kg). Apples are regarded domestic when they are grown and harvested in Finland 36 

although the cultivar strain itself may be of non-domestic origin. The market share of local 37 

production (4.8 million kg) is 4-6% of the total consumption of apples in Finland (Finnish 38 

Customs, 2013; Tike, 2013). 39 

Consumers’ willingness to spend money on a commodity can be studied with a range of 40 

hypothetical (e.g. contingent valuation, hypothetical choice experiment) and non-41 

hypothetical value elicitation methods (VEMs). Non-hypothetical VEMs, such as 42 

experimental auctions, have gained rising popularity in the last two decades as a tool for the 43 

valuation of private and public goods mainly because of their ability to mimic real market 44 

situations by using real products and allowing for exchange of real money. This is probably 45 

why non-hypothetical VEM tends to provide more accurate willingness to pay (WTP) 46 

values than their hypothetical counterparts (Lusk & Shogren, 2007). Various combinations 47 

and designs have been used, the common feature being that real products need to be 48 

present, which may be accompanied with tasting of some or all of the samples by some or 49 

all respondents (e.g. Combris, Bazoche, Giraud-Héraud, & Issanchou, 2009; Lange, Martin, 50 

Chabanet, Combris, & Issanchou, 2002; McCluskey, Mittelhammer, Marin, & Wright, 51 

2007; Yue & Tong, 2011). 52 

In experimental auctions, a set of rules are used to determine, based on participants’ bids, 53 

who the winner of the auctioned good is and what price is to be paid. Different auction 54 

mechanisms have been used in empirical studies such as Vickrey 2nd (Grebitus et al., 2013; 55 

Lange et al., 2002; Noussair, Robin, & Ruffieux, 2004) and nth price auction (Stefani, 56 

Romano, & Cavicchi, 2006; Zhang & Vickers, 2014) and Becker-Degroot-Marschack 57 

(BDM) auction (Becker, Degroot, & Marschack, 1964; Combris et al., 2009; Ginon, 58 

2 



Combris, Lohéac, Enderli, & Issanchou, 2014; Lusk, Fox, Schroeder, Mintert, & 59 

Koohmaraie, 2001; Lusk & Shogren, 2007; Noussair et al., 2004). 60 

Experimental auctions have been applied in specialty products such as Champagne (Lange 61 

et al., 2002), region-of-origin labelled spelt (Stefani et al., 2006), GM-foods (Jaeger et al., 62 

2004), and everyday commodities like apples (Costanigro, Kroll, Thilmany, & Bunning, 63 

2014; Lund, Jaeger, Amos, Brookfield, & Harker, 2006; Zhang & Vickers, 2014), steaks 64 

(Lusk et al., 2001), orange drink, cookies and chocolate (Noussair et al., 2004), and wine 65 

(Combris et al., 2009; Grebitus et al., 2013). Lusk et al (2001) examined the effect of 66 

sensory information for steak tenderness on consumer WTP in a grocery store setting. 67 

When relying on tasting alone, an average premium was less than in condition in which 68 

samples were tasted and written information about tenderness was provided. 69 

Hedonic ratings have been combined with WTP, either in within- or between-subjects 70 

settings. For example, Lange et al. (2002) had two respondent groups, one of which 71 

reported hedonic ratings of the samples, while the other rated WTP. In their study, Yue & 72 

Tong (2011) considered 14 apple cultivars, and respondents stated their WTP and liking of 73 

attributes (such as juiciness) for 6-7 samples, but not their overall liking. Lund et al. (2006) 74 

measuring liking after tasting, found that tasting had small effect on the mean WTP, but the 75 

distribution of the bids was different before and after tasting the samples. Ginon et al. 76 

(2014) observed a slightly better discrimination between cheese and bread samples with 77 

WTP mechanism than with ratings of liking.  78 

Previous studies have mainly concentrated in studying discrimination ability of WTP 79 

compared to hedonic ratings. Apart from Lange et al. (2002) and the very recent articles by 80 

Zhang & Vickers (2014) and Ginon et al. (2014), who studied the relationship of WTP and 81 

liking with correlations, studies with direct comparison of WTP and hedonic responses are, 82 

to our knowledge, rare. Lange et al. (2002), studying WTP for Champagne, found that 83 

higher product discrimination was reached with bid prices than with hedonic ratings. Zhang 84 

& Vickers (2014) studied apples using two information conditions (taste first or 85 

information first). They measured both WTP and liking, but focused their discussion 86 

mainly on the effect of information condition, cultivar and growing conditions on bid price. 87 

Liking a food product has been shown to be a major driver of choice (e.g. Arvola, 88 

Lähteenmäki, & Tuorila, 1999; Seppä, Railio, Vehkalahti, Tahvonen, & Tuorila, 2013a; 89 

3 



Huotilainen, Seppälä, Pirttilä-Backman, & Tuorila, 2006), and thus pleasantness, measured 90 

through hedonic rating, may be a predominant driver of WTP.  Consequently, hedonic 91 

rating may be highly correlated with WTP. When designing this experiment we were 92 

interested in finding out how perceived pleasantness is shown in WTP. 93 

The shoppers are typically able to examine only the extrinsic properties of the product i.e. 94 

visual information, such as colour and size, while repeated purchases ultimately depend on 95 

whether the inner sensory properties (flavour, texture) of the fruit were well-liked (Harker, 96 

Gunson, & Jaeger, 2003; Jaeger et al., 2011; Jaeger & MacFie, 2001; McCluskey et al., 97 

2007). The timing of information may markedly affect expectations and actual perceptions 98 

of a product (Kähkönen, Tuorila, & Rita, 1996; Lange, Issanchou, & Combris, 2000; Zhang 99 

& Vickers, 2014). Kähkönen et al. (1996) showed that nutritional information offered 100 

before exposures increased pleasantness ratings. However, use of sensory descriptions as a 101 

type of information is rare. To our knowledge, only Lusk et al. (2001) has used this kind of 102 

information in WTP research. In addition, previous consumption practices and involvement 103 

in the product play a role in pleasantness, purchase intention and WTP (Hollebeek, Jaeger, 104 

Brodie, & Balemi, 2007; Kähkönen & Tuorila, 1999; Lange et al., 2002). Lange et al. 105 

(2002) observed that brand information increased WTP in respondents who consumed 106 

Champagne unfrequently, while frequent consumers of Champagne relied more on their 107 

individual hedonic expectations. 108 

Based on the above papers, we have identified the following gaps: First, there is very little 109 

information on the effects of sensory descriptions on the hedonic ratings or WTP. 110 

Secondly, previous research has not explicitly analysed functional relationship between 111 

hedonic ratings and WTP. Furthermore, previous consumption has not been paid attention 112 

to except by Lange et al. (2002), while their samples were not an everyday commodity.  113 

Therefore, the present study compares the effect of information provided at different phases 114 

(appearance of the product, written descriptive sensory information, tasting) on hedonic 115 

ratings and WTP, using a familiar local product frequently used as a snack (i.e. apple) with 116 

distinct sensory properties. The research questions were formulated as follows: 1) do the 117 

information of the product attributes and the timing of the information affect hedonic 118 

ratings and WTP, 2) what is the functional relationship between pleasantness and WTP, i.e. 119 

F(plea) = a + b*plea,  and 3) how does previous domestic and general apple consumption 120 

affect hedonic ratings and WTP.  121

2 Materials and methods  122 

2.1 Samples 123 

Four domestic apple cultivars (‘Amorosa’, ‘Konsta’, ‘Lobo’, ‘Tobias’) were selected for the 124 

study based on their distinct sensory characteristics representing major sensory variations 125 

of cultivars in production and their availability during the study. ‘Lobo’ is the most widely 126 

cultivated domestic cultivar and ‘Amorosa’ is rapidly gaining popularity. ‘Konsta’ and 127 

‘Tobias’ are novel cultivars. Each cultivar was harvested from one orchard in South-128 

Western Finland. The apples were kept in the cold storage (+3°C, relative humidity 80–129 

92%) of the research orchard of MTT (Agrifood Research Finland) until evaluations. Just 130 

before the first session, the apples were transferred to the cold storage (+4°C) at the 131 

University of Helsinki, where the evaluations were carried out. 132 

The sensory profiles of the four samples (Figure 1) were determined by a trained panel 133 

(n=13, 11F, 2M, 24-57 years) using generic descriptive analysis as described by Seppä, 134 

Railio, Mononen, Tahvonen, & Tuorila (2012). All cultivars are red with some yellow or 135 

green colour. ‘Amorosa’ and ‘Lobo’ are crispy and juicy. Sourness of ‘Amorosa’ and 136 

‘Konsta’ is typical for domestic cultivars. ‘Tobias’ is the least sour and least crispy of the 137 

four cultivars. Analysis of variance showed that the cultivars differed in all attributes except 138 

sweetness (p<0.001). The written apple descriptions provided (Table 1) were based on the 139 

descriptive analyses of the four cultivars reported in Seppä et al. (2012) and Seppä, 140 

Peltoniemi, Tahvonen, & Tuorila (2013b), evaluated in 2009 and 2010.  141 

An unexpected difficulty was that the written sensory information, based on descriptive 142 

analysis of apples from the years 2009-2010, did not fully correspond to the actual sensory 143 

properties of the cultivars of the present study (apples of the year 2011). The slight 144 

differences were observed in sweetness and textural properties, due to the rainy weather of 145 

the growing season. For example, ‘Konsta’ was less crispy and ‘Tobias’ less sweet than 146 

previous years. General apple information (process/dessert apple, colour of jam) was from 147 

Tahvonen (2007).  148 

2.2 Participants 149 

The respondents (n=118, 95F, 23M, mean age 37 years, range 19–79) were recruited by 150 

posters, e-mail posting lists and personal on-site contacts at the campus and neighbouring 151 

5 



workplaces and residential areas. They randomly signed up for 13 separate sessions, each 152 

participant to one session according to his or her schedule. The sessions were carried out 153 

either in the morning, mid-day or late afternoon. The late afternoon times were chosen so 154 

that those with full-time jobs were able to take part in the study. At the end of a session, 155 

each participant completed a questionnaire including demographic information and apple 156 

eating habits (Table 2).  157 

The study protocol followed the ethical guidelines of the sensory laboratory, approved by 158 

the Ethical Committee of Viikki Campus, University of Helsinki. A written informed 159 

consent was obtained from each participant before entering the study. They used their own 160 

money in the study and received a gift card with a value of 10 euros after completing the 161 

task as a compensation for participating in the study. 162 

2.3 Procedure 163 

The data were collected in a classroom at the University within two weeks during the apple 164 

season. The arrangements followed the normal practices of sensory evaluation, in that the 165 

cultivars, evaluated at room temperature, were coded with three-digit numbers and 166 

presented in randomised order. The randomised order was printed individually in each 167 

ballot. The respondents were asked to evaluate the apples in the order provided in their 168 

individual ballots. 169 

In each round, two types of responses were elicited. First, the respondents rated the 170 

pleasantness of the cultivars on a nine-point scale (1 ‘extremely unpleasant’ to 9 ‘extremely 171 

pleasant’) and then indicated their WTP, expressed as the maximum amount of money in 172 

euros each participant was willing to pay for a kilogram of apples (euro/kg). One paper 173 

ballot for reporting pleasantness and WTP was used in each round and collected after the 174 

round. A new ballot was given for the next round which followed immediately the previous 175 

round. Respondents were instructed to drink water after tasting each sample. Unflavoured 176 

corn snacks were also available for rinsing the mouth. 177 

The procedure used in the auction was the BDM-mechanism (see 2.3.2). Each participant 178 

signed up for one session, comprising three hedonic ratings and auction rounds (Figure 2). 179 

Three treatments (TR1, TR2, TR3) were used, and each session was randomly assigned to 180 

one treatment type. The total number of sessions was 13. The number of participants per 181 

session varied from 6 to 14. To offer different types of treatments at different times of the 182 

6 



day, more than one session was conducted per treatment. TR1 was used in three sessions, 183 

and TR2 and TR3 in five sessions. 184 

Each of the three treatments was conducted in three rounds (R1, R2, R3). In each round 185 

participants were allowed to either look at the samples or taste them or they were given 186 

written information on the sensory characteristics of each sample. The type and order of the 187 

cues depended on the treatment and the round and was provided sequentially (Figure 2). 188 

The unpeeled cultivars were on display in open bowls (visual and written information 189 

phases) or given in four separate closed paper bags (tasting). The three-digit codes of the 190 

apples were written on the edge of the bowls, on the bags and above the written 191 

information. Following Combris et al. (2009), respondents were requested not to talk to 192 

each other during the session. In addition, they were asked not to inform other people about 193 

the experiment before the end of data collection. To avoid the problem of bid affiliation and 194 

to carry out a clean assessment of the information effect, we did not post participants’ bids 195 

after each round (Corrigan & Rousu, 2006). 196 

2.3.1 Treatments 197 

TR1 was designed to serve as a control group, which allows testing round-effect and 198 

whether there was over-bid or under-bid in the first rounds. The control group helps to 199 

evaluate whether any change in pleasantness or WTP in TR2 or TR3 between rounds was 200 

caused by the round or by other effects such as learning (Lusk & Shogren, 2007). Hence, 201 

participants in TR1 (n=25) did not receive any other information than visual cues nor did 202 

they taste the apples throughout the three rounds. They rated pleasantness and WTP based 203 

only on the visual inspection of the four apple cultivars. At the beginning of each round, 204 

participants were invited to inspect the apples in the bowls placed at the front and back of 205 

the room.  206 

Similar to TR1, the other two treatments had visual exposure in the first round. In the 207 

second round, participants in TR2 (n=44) received written information about sensory 208 

characteristics of the apples (Figure 2, Table 1), and those in TR3 (n=49) were invited to 209 

taste the four cultivars. In the third round, participants in TR2 were instructed to taste the 210 

apples, while those in TR3 were given the written information. Thus, the main interest was 211 

finding out the effect of individual and cumulating information as well as its type and 212 

timing on pleasantness and further on WTP. 213 

7 



2.3.2 BDM auction  214 

The auction followed the BDM-mechanism. In BDM-mechanism, participants report their 215 

WTP for a single unit of a specific product. Then, the experimenter randomly chooses one 216 

of the participants to randomly draw a single price from a price distribution. All 217 

participants with a bid higher than the randomly drawn price are declared buyers. Each 218 

buyer obtains one unit of the auctioned product and pays a price equal to the randomly 219 

drawn price. 220 

BDM-mechanism was chosen because it is insensitive to the number of participants in 221 

auction sessions and the simplicity of its implementation with inexperienced participants 222 

(Combris et al., 2009; Jaeger et al., 2004; Lusk & Shogren, 2007). The main advantage of 223 

BDM is that it does not require the same number of participants in each session because 224 

participants in the same session are not competing as it is the case in Vickrey auction. This 225 

makes practical arrangement easier than with some other methods. It is also theoretically 226 

incentive-compatibility (i.e. the best bidding strategy for participants is to truthfully report 227 

their bids for the auctioned product). 228 

Before the first round, an explanation of the BDM-procedure was given (a tailored power 229 

point presentation for each treatment type). First, the sequence of the rounds in each 230 

treatment and the importance of following the individual presentation order of the samples 231 

(printed in the ballots) were explained. Next, the evaluation and drawing procedures were 232 

explained. Then, to ensure that participants had understood the procedures, a practical 233 

training session was conducted with a snack bar. The training was important, since the 234 

BDM-mechanism was unfamiliar to participants, and those who are not well trained are 235 

likely to underestimate their WTP (Drichoutis, Nayga, & Lazaridis, 2011). After the 236 

training phase, participants were encouraged to ask questions if anything was left unclear. 237 

Then the three rounds were conducted, followed by the identification of buyers and the 238 

price that has to be paid. 239 

After the training and before the starting of the first round, participants were given the 240 

range of domestic apple market prices during the previous season (1.80–6.00 euro/kg), 241 

obtained from the Association of Finnish Fruit and Vegetable Producers. It was explained 242 

thoroughly that the price depends on the time of the season and the type and quality of 243 

apples. The range of market prices was given for several reasons: a) not all participants 244 

8 



were familiar with the market prices, since the market share of the domestic apples is low, 245 

b) domestic apples are sold only during the apple season (end of August to late December), 246 

and people may lose their price consciousness if domestic apples are not an everyday food 247 

item, c) apples are often obtained free of money from own garden or that of a relative or 248 

friend, which makes it even more difficult to estimate the prices. Providing market price 249 

information to participants is not uncommon in valuation studies (see Lusk, Feldkamp, & 250 

Schroeder, 2004; Lusk & Shogren, 2007). About 20% of the bids were below 1.80 and the 251 

highest was 5.00 euros.  252 

At the end of the session, one of the three rounds was randomly selected to be the binding 253 

round. Next, one of the auctioned products in the binding round was randomly chosen to 254 

determine the binding product. Finally, the price was randomly drawn from a price 255 

distribution ranging from 1.00 to 6.00 euro/kg with an increment of 20 cents. All three 256 

draws were done by randomly selected participants. The respondent purchased apples, if 257 

her/his bid was greater than the randomly drawn price in the binding round. For practical 258 

reasons, apples were packed beforehand into transparent plastic bags, weighting between 259 

500-600 g, and containing 5-6 apples. Participants were able to choose the bag they wanted 260 

if they won the bid, and paid the randomly drawn price. 261 

2.4 Data analysis 262 

Mean pleasantness ratings and WTP were calculated across treatments and rounds for each 263 

cultivar and also for each treatment and round separately. Differences in pleasantness and 264 

WTP were analysed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance for each 265 

treatment separately with the factors cultivar (4) and round (3). Main effects and 266 

interactions were studied at the significance level p=0.05. Least significance difference 267 

(LSD) test was used for multiple comparisons of cultivars and rounds. Difference in 268 

pleasantness and WTP between TR2 and TR3 in the last round (R3) was tested with t-test 269 

for independent samples. The functional relationship between pleasantness and WTP was 270 

assessed using the linear regression analysis.  271 

Two age groups were formed for the purpose of the analyses: 34 years or younger (n=66, 272 

56%) and older than 34 years (n=52, 44%). Two new variables were generated for apple 273 

eating frequency, “heavy eaters” (more than once a week) and “light eaters” (once a week 274 

or less), for domestic apples and apples in general. In the following text, the term “apple 275 

9 



consumption” refers to apple eating, as respondents were asked only about eating apples. 276 

Using apples for cooking or other processes such as making jam were excluded. 277 

The effect of gender, age group and dichotomised apple eating frequency on pleasantness 278 

and WTP was tested using t-test. Differences in the demographic background of 279 

respondents between treatment groups were tested with analysis of variance. 280 

All respondents who reported their age, frequency of eating domestic apples and WTP for 281 

the samples were included in the analyses, leading to 118 participants. One of them did not 282 

rate pleasantness of the cultivars in TR2, round 1, one did not report frequency of eating 283 

apples in general, and four answered the question concerning income class “don’t want to 284 

tell”. The missing data were not imputed. PASW 18 was used to carry out the statistical 285 

analyses (PASW Statistics 18.0.2, IBM SPSS Software, Chicago, IL, USA).  286 

3 Results 287 

3.1 Participants 288 

All participants reported to be living in Helsinki metropolitan area. Overall they were 289 

highly educated, as 67% had at least college education (Table 2). Little over 40% were 290 

students, but half of them were part-time workers. One third (32%) earned 20 000 euros or 291 

less, and 45% earned between 20 001 and 60 000 euros a year. There was no significant 292 

difference in age, frequency of eating apples, hedonic ratings or WTP between female and 293 

male participants, nor were there differences in hedonic ratings or WTP between the two 294 

age groups (≤34 y., >34 y.), with the exception of the group of younger participants who 295 

perceived the sour cultivar ‘Konsta’ as slightly less pleasant (p=0.018). There were no 296 

major differences in participants’ demographic background between the treatments. No 297 

systematic difference appeared between evaluations either when comparing hedonic ratings 298 

or WTP between the first rounds of the three treatments (p>0.6). 299 

All respondents were regular apple consumers, and 87% ate apples frequently (“2-4 times a 300 

month” to “daily”). Domestic apples and apples in general were eaten daily by 37% and 301 

25% of the respondents, respectively. Among all respondents, 56% (n=66) were heavy 302 

eaters of apples in general, while 64% (n=76) were heavy eaters of domestic apples. The 303 

frequency of consumption did not differ between the treatments for domestic apples or 304 

apples in general (p-values from 0.281 to 0.651 and from 0.182 to 0.706, respectively). 305 

10 



3.2 Hedonic ratings and WTP 306 

The average hedonic rating and WTP over all cultivars, rounds and treatments were 6.6 (SD 307 

± 1.7), and 2.36 euro/kg (SD ± 0.91), respectively. Eight respondents reported zero WTP 308 

(0.00 euro/kg) for one or more cultivars in one or more sessions, but none gave zero to all 309 

offers. In total, there were only 27 zero bids among 1416 bids. The means of pleasantness 310 

and WTP were quite similar for ‘Amorosa’, ‘Lobo’, ‘Tobias’, whereas they were lower for 311 

‘Konsta’. Taking into account only the results from TR1 (all rounds) and R1 in TR2 and 312 

TR3, where the assessment was based on appearance only, differences between the 313 

cultivars were found to be small (Table 3).  Mean pleasantness ranged from 6.1 (‘Konsta’ 314 

and ‘Amorosa’) to 7.0 (‘Amorosa’) and mean WTP ranged from 2.18 (‘Konsta’) to 2.47 315 

euro/kg (‘Amorosa’, ‘Lobo’, ‘Tobias’).  316 

3.3 Effect of information on hedonic ratings and WTP  317 

To study the effect of the type of information and its timing and cumulation (Research 318 

Question 1), data was organised in treatments and rounds (Figure 2). There was no main 319 

effect of round in hedonic ratings but WTP differed between rounds in TR1 and TR2 320 

(Table 4). Differences between cultivars were clear in TR2 and TR3 in terms of both 321 

pleasantness and WTP. In TR2 and TR3, interaction between cultivar and round was 322 

significant for both pleasantness and WTP (p<0.001 for all), indicating that they changed 323 

between rounds depending on the cultivar, when written information and taste were 324 

involved. 325 

When pleasantness and WTP were studied between cultivars in each treatment and round 326 

separately, no difference was observed in all rounds in TR1 or R1 in TR2 (i.e. visual cues) 327 

(Table 3). In the second and third round of TR2 and TR3, differences between cultivars 328 

were all significant. ‘Konsta’ and ‘Tobias’ got the lowest and highest ratings, respectively. 329 

In TR2, between R2 and R3 (written information followed by tasting), pleasantness and 330 

WTP for ‘Tobias’ decreased by 0.6 units (on the 9-point pleasantness scale) and 0.29 331 

euro/kg, respectively, but the difference is not significant (p=0.054 and p=0.219, 332 

respectively). 333 

Examining the ratings of pleasantness and WTP between rounds showed that the order and 334 

type of information affected the measures. When the evaluation was done based on visual 335 

cues only (TR1), there was no difference between rounds in any of the cultivars (Table 3). 336 

11 



When information followed the visual cues of R1 (TR2, R2), ratings of pleasantness and 337 

WTP for the sour cultivar ‘Konsta’ declined from 6.1 to 5.5 and they rose for the other 338 

cultivars, although only the difference in pleasantness of  red  and somewhat mealy 339 

‘Tobias’ was statistically significant (p=0.027). Tasting the apples (TR2, R3) caused the 340 

pleasantness of ‘Tobias’ to decline from 7.4 to 6.7 (p=0.054). Comparing the sour ‘Konsta’ 341 

between R1(visual) and R3(taste) revealed a decline of 1.1 in pleasantness (p=0.009) and 342 

0.47 euro/kg in WTP (p=0.017). For other cultivars, no significant difference was observed 343 

between R1 and R3 in TR2.  344 

When tasting followed visual cues (TR3 R2), ratings of pleasantness and WTP rose for 345 

‘Amorosa’ from 6.1 to 7.2 and from 2.19 to 2.59 euro/kg (p<0.001 and p=0.006, 346 

respectively), respectively, and for ‘Konsta’, ratings of pleasantness declined from 6.4 to 347 

5.5 (p=0.008). When written information followed visual cues and tasting (TR3, R3), no 348 

change in pleasantness or WTP was observed in any of the cultivars, indicating that 349 

providing written information after tasting has low impact. With all cues present differences 350 

in pleasantness and WTP (TR2, R3 vs TR3, R3) were found to be small between TR2 and 351 

TR3, except pleasantness for ‘Tobias’ (p=0.039), because in TR2, pleasantness declined 352 

after tasting (from 7.36 to 6.73) to the same level where it was before written information 353 

(6.63).  354 

3.4 Comparison of hedonic ratings and WTP 355 

The aforementioned results suggest that the round and the type of information affected the 356 

pleasantness and WTP in different ways, depending on the cultivar and information 357 

(Research Question 1). When WTP was predicted by pleasantness using pooled cultivar 358 

data (linear regression analysis), β and R² varied only slightly by treatment and round in the 359 

models (Research Question 2) (Table 5). The results of the models’ estimation show that 360 

when pleasantness goes up by one point, WTP increases by 0.31 to 0.45 euro/kg. 361 

Furthermore, the estimated models explained 38-55% of WTP. Thus, about half of WTP is 362 

caused by other reasons than pleasantness. 363 

3.5 Effect of frequency of consumption on pleasantness and WTP 364 

To study the effect of frequency of consumption on pleasantness and WTP, respondents 365 

were divided into groups based on their reported frequency of eating domestic apples and 366 

apples in general (Research Question 3). The heavy eaters of domestic apples were older 367 

12 



than light eaters (40.9 y. vs. 31.6 y., p=0.002), while for the eaters of apples in general, the 368 

age difference was smaller (39.6 y. vs. 34.5y., p=0.080). There was no major difference in 369 

education or income level between either of the eating frequency groups (p-values from 370 

0.309 to 0.822).  371 

Heavy eaters of domestic apples reported a higher WTP than light eaters of domestic apples 372 

(p≤0.001). The mean difference between these groups was highest for ‘Lobo’ (0.74 373 

euro/kg) and smallest for ‘Amorosa’ (0.52 euro/kg). The ratings of pleasantness were also 374 

higher among the heavy eaters than light eaters of domestic apples, but the statistical 375 

difference was less significant (p varied from 0.015 to 0.175). For heavy and light eaters of 376 

apples in general, no major differences in pleasantness or WTP were observed.  377 

Studying WTP in more detail by treatment and round showed that the heavy eaters of 378 

domestic apples were willing to pay from 0.26 to 1.13 euro/kg more than the light eaters, 379 

and the majority of the differences were significant (Table 6). Most of the differences in 380 

pleasantness were small and below the level of significance (data not shown). Again, no 381 

differences were observed between the heavy and light eaters of apples in general in either 382 

of the measures. The results indicate that heavy eaters of domestic apples are motivated to 383 

pay higher prices for domestic apples, even in situations where they find the pleasantness of 384 

these apples modest.  385 

When linear regression models were specified to predict WTP by pleasantness based on 386 

treatment and eating frequency groups of domestic apples or apples in general, results did 387 

not show any reasonable trend, although some models differed between the heavy eaters of 388 

domestic apples compared to the heavy eaters of apples in general. With low number of 389 

respondents due to the treatments (n≤20 in some of the eating frequency groups), no 390 

definite conclusions are possible regarding the effect of pleasantness on WTP in the eating 391 

frequency groups. 392 

4 Discussion  393 

4.1 General overview 394 

We had three main research questions to answer: 1) how do information and its timing 395 

affect hedonic ratings and WTP, 2) what is the relationship between WTP and hedonic 396 

ratings, and 3) how does frequency of consumption affect these measures. The overall mean 397 

13 



rating of pleasantness and WTP was 6.6 and WTP 2.36 euro/kg, respectively. When only 398 

visual cues were available, differences between cultivars were small. With accumulating 399 

information, both pleasantness and WTP differentiated cultivars in all settings (R2 and R3 400 

in both TR2 and TR3) (Research Question 1). Similar observations were made by Zhang & 401 

Vickers (2014). Regression models showed that when pleasantness increased by one point 402 

(scale 1-9), WTP increased by 0.31 to 0.45 euro/kg (Research Question 2). Reported use 403 

frequency of domestic apples increased WTP considerably, over 0.5 euro/kg (Research 404 

Question 3). 405 

4.2 Comparison of hedonic ratings and WTP 406 

Our results suggest that the round and the type of information affected the pleasantness and 407 

WTP, but the effect depended on the cultivar and information available (Research Question 408 

1). Thus, we concur with Arvola et al. (1999) who showed that pleasantness of cheese 409 

measured by tasting dominated over attitudes as a choice criterion, especially with 410 

unfamiliar cheeses. Although apples differ from cheeses both by nature and typical ways of 411 

use, our results suggest that offering shoppers a possibility to taste a product is a strategy 412 

worth to consider in marketing. 413 

The means of the ratings of pleasantness for each cultivar showed that sour ‘Konsta’ was 414 

regarded as the least pleasant and not-sour ‘Tobias’ as the most pleasant. As regard the 415 

WTP, similar results were found (i.e. participants’ WTP was the lowest for sour ‘Konsta’ 416 

and the highest for not-sour ‘Tobias’). While both evaluation methods revealed almost 417 

identical discrimination between the cultivars and rounds, there were also differences. For 418 

‘Tobias’ in TR2(visual-information-tasting), pleasantness differed between the rounds more 419 

than WTP. Also, differences between cultivars were larger in R2(information) of TR2 with 420 

pleasantness than with WTP. Noussair et al. (2004), comparing hedonic ratings and WTP 421 

measured with Vickrey (orange drinks and chocolate bar) or BDM (cookies) auctions 422 

reported results similar to ours. 423 

As documented in previous studies (Combris et al., 2009; Kähkönen et al., 1996; Lange et 424 

al., 2000), information has an effect on hedonic ratings and WTP, and the magnitude and 425 

direction of change depend on the samples tested. In the present study, ratings of 426 

pleasantness differentiated rounds (information stages) of two cultivars in TR2 and TR3, 427 

14 



but WTP only one cultivar in each treatment. Thus, pleasantness revealed differences more 428 

clearly.  429 

Lange et al. (2002), studying five different Champagnes, found a better product 430 

discrimination with WTP than hedonic ratings. Value of the finding diminishes slightly 431 

because WTP and liking data were collected from different groups, although demographic 432 

background was balanced and ranking order of the Champagnes did not change. However, 433 

it may be that Champagne is a product for which price differences are more critical and 434 

more sensitive indicator of quality than liking. In Lange et al. (2002), this was the case 435 

especially for he unfrequent consumers of Champagne.  Noussair et al. (2004) noted that 436 

social or internal pressure may cause participants to rate their WTP higher than the actual 437 

liking is. Apples are unlikely to create such pressure. 438 

Information of the character of ‘Konsta’ has a clear meaning to Finns: when an apple is 439 

process apple, it is sour, crispy and firm. However, ‘Konsta’ was somewhat mealy and only 440 

medium crispy and thus, proved to be a disappointment as crispiness is a highly valued 441 

property of apples (Galmarini, Symoneaux, Chollet, & Zamora, 2013; Harker et al., 2003; 442 

Seppä et al., 2013a).  443 

Likewise, information on ‘Tobias’ created expectations, this time positive, and pleasantness 444 

rose substantially, while the rise in WTP was less significant. Tasting declined the rate of 445 

pleasantness of ‘Tobias’ sharply, contrary to WTP, which declined more moderately. 446 

Possibly the texture of ‘Tobias’ was also a disappointment, but as the cultivar is novel, 447 

respondents were willing to purchase it in spite of its mealy quality.  448 

Zhang & Vickers (2014) observed that for cultivar ‘Braeburn’ (a cultivar familiar to the 449 

participants), bids decreased significantly after tasting in information first -condition, while 450 

in taste first -condition, not much change in the bids was observed after the second step, 451 

giving information. The lot of ‘Braeburn’ in that study was exceptionally soft, and thus 452 

respondents were disappointed with it, a case similar to “Tobias” in our study. With its low 453 

sourness, ‘Tobias’ is rather atypical for a domestic cultivar. However, the cultivar may have 454 

been slightly over-ripe and its sweetness was lower than previous years, on which the 455 

written sensory information was based (Seppä et al., 2012; 2013b). Thus, great care must be 456 

taken when formatting written descriptions. They should be realistic and cover typical 457 

15 



quality variations. Quality characteristics should also be taken into account in marketing 458 

claims. 459 

4.3 Effect of frequency of consumption on pleasantness and WTP 460 

Results of linear regression analysis showed that about half of WTP could be explained 461 

with pleasantness (Research Question 2), while the other half of WTP is caused by other 462 

factors, such as background variables and situational factors. One of these variables was 463 

shown to be previous use frequency of domesic apples, but not that of apples in general 464 

(Research Question 3). Thus, WTP increased with reported high consumption of domestic 465 

apples. In accordance with the findings by Hollebeek et al. (2007), our results suggest that 466 

frequent consumers of a food product are more willing to pay higher price for it because 467 

they know what they are paying for.  468 

Naturally, respondents also tend to like the products they frequently consume (Kähkönen & 469 

Tuorila, 1999). However, the present results suggest that frequent consumption leads to 470 

increases in WTP, but not necessarily in ratings of liking. It may be even possible that for 471 

frequent eaters of domestic apples, pleasantness is less important than the possibility of 472 

buying domestic apples, which are not always easily available in big cities. Consequently, 473 

frequent consumers of a product are familiar not only with the product itself, but also more 474 

able to read and interpret written descriptions of it. This is supported with the findings from 475 

comments analysis by Galmarini et al. (2013): respondents who ate apples daily mentioned 476 

more descriptive words and cultivar names than those who ate apples less frequently, i.e. 477 

vocabulary concerning apples was more familiar.  478 

Yue & Tong (2011) found that frequent apple buyers were slightly younger, had larger 479 

household size and had higher income level than infrequent buyers. However, only the age 480 

category mean was reported, and consequently, real mean age was not revealed. In our 481 

study, the heavy eaters were older than light eaters in both categories, although the 482 

difference was clearer with domestic apples, and no differences in income level were 483 

observed between the frequency of consumption groups. In this research, the respondents 484 

were asked to report their own consumption only, while Yue & Tong (2011) inquired about 485 

apple buying, in which case people with families naturally report buying more apples. 486 

4.4 Methodological considerations 487 

16 



Lund et al. (2006), investigating the effect of apple freshness using WTP, were surprised to 488 

learn how little participants knew about normal storage times of apples, an observation 489 

confirmed by Harker et al. (2003). Participants in Lund et al. (2006) were not aware of the 490 

seasonality of apples either. On the contrary, Finns should be well aware of the seasonal 491 

nature of garden produce, including apples, because of the clear seasonality in the weather. 492 

Thus, we believe that the separate questions concerning eating frequency of domestic 493 

apples and apples in general were soundly based. Proof for this is that the frequencies of 494 

consumption differentiated the participants, some were heavy eaters of one type of apples 495 

but not the other, and vice versa, while there was also a group of heavy eaters of both apple 496 

types. 497 

In studies where the effect of written or label information on WTP has been investigated, 498 

the information has usually comprised of health-related information (Ginon, Lohéac, 499 

Martin, Combris, & Issanchou, 2009; Kähkönen et al., 1999) or claims concerning origin 500 

(Combris et al., 2009; Costanigro et al., 2014; Grebitus et a., 2013; Hollebeek et al., 2007; 501 

Stefani et al., 2006; Zhang & Vickers, 2014), quality (Ginon et al., 2014; Lange et al., 502 

2002; Lund et al., 2006) or production method (Zhang & Vickers (2014). To our 503 

knowledge, the research by Lusk et al. (2001) on steak tenderness is the only one before our 504 

study where descriptions of the sensory properties of a product have been used as a source 505 

of information. In this sense our work is unique, while, on the other hand, this type of 506 

product information will not elicit polarised or extreme responses, as is more likely in the 507 

case of health or production method information. 508 

The original plan was to allow purchases of one kg or even more, but we were forced to 509 

limit it to 0.5 kg, because one cultivar came from several orchards and not from one as 510 

would be the optimal case. As we wanted the apples from each cultivar to originate from 511 

only one orchard, we had to set a limit to the quantity we could sell to guarantee sufficient 512 

amount of apples throughout the sessions. We believe that this did not affect the auction 513 

procedure, because in Finland, it is very common to buy apples by the number, especially if 514 

buying for a snack. As domestic apples are relative small, a package of 0.5 kg to 0.6 kg 515 

contained 4-7 apples. Yet, the shoppers are informed of the price of kg, when buying fruits 516 

or vegetables, so the situation resembled a normal shopping occasion.  517 

The number of zero bids was 2% (27 cases). The zero price option was not specifically 518 

stressed in our study but it was mentioned during the training. The low number of zero bits 519 

17 



is probably because apple prices are generally low, compared to products of higher 520 

monetary value such as steaks or Champagne. Apples are an ordinary food product in 521 

Finland, as they are the second most common fruit after bananas (Finnish Customs, 2013). 522 

In addition, domestic apples of good quality are not always easily available in the city, 523 

which may have increased interest. Consequently, the respondents found apples a useful 524 

item to buy.  525 

Previous research (Seppä et al., 2013a) suggested that apple eaters can be clustered into 526 

three distinct groups: those who prefer sour & firm, medium sour & medium sweet or sweet 527 

& slightly soft apples, which is in accordance with the findings by other researchers (e.g. 528 

Carbonell, Izquierdo, Carbonell, & Costell, 2008; Tomala, Baryłko-Pikielna, Jankowski, 529 

Jeziorek, & Wasiak-Zys, 2009). Here, dividing respondents into preference segments was 530 

not worthwhile, because, due to the treatments, the number of respondents would have been 531 

too small for clustering. Further research should aim at having either a higher number of 532 

respondents than here, or using a simpler procedure to obtain a detailed analysis of 533 

pleasantness and WTP and their relationship in different consumer groups. Without 534 

considering clusters, we may end up having products that are acceptable, but not delightful.  535 

5 Conclusions and future prospects 536 

To maximise consumer satisfaction and future purchases it is important to know consumer 537 

preferences and willingness to pay for different products. As for the apple cultivars, 538 

traditionally new crosses have been selected for cultivation based on a few opinions 539 

(usually those of the breeders), which does not guarantee that the sensory quality of these 540 

apples will be widely popular. The results emphasise that tasting experience is important 541 

before the purchase decision. Good labelling enables consumers to purchase again their 542 

favourite cultivar.  Farmers should be encouraged to use alternative forms of market 543 

channels such as farmer’s market or the other forms of farmer-to-consumer direct 544 

marketing, where farmers are able to discuss with their customers and provide them 545 

additional information and allow them to taste the products. 546 

Finding that the frequent consumers of domestic apples are willing to pay for apples over 547 

half euro per kg more than other respondents, suggests that promotion of domestic apple 548 

consumption eventually promotes also the prices paid for them. Information of good quality 549 

and proper timing is a prominent way of assisting consumption. Mean WTP 2.36 (SD ± 550 

18 



0.91 euro/kg) obtained from this study shows that consumers are willing to pay a price 551 

premium for domestic apples. Apples of non-domestic origin are sold around the year at a 552 

low price of 1 euro/kg or less. 553 

Our results showed that almost the same discrimination is achieved with pleasantness and 554 

WTP. Differences between cultivars were rather small when rated pleasantness and WTP 555 

were based only on the appearance of the auctioned apple cultivars. Substantial differences 556 

emerged, when other aspects were added, especially written information and tasting 557 

combined. Currently, in a normal shopping situation, consumers receive very little 558 

information about the cultivars available (either domestic or imported). Finally, an 559 

interesting topic for future research is to replicate our study measuring consumers’ hedonic 560 

ratings and WTP for both domestic and imported apples. 561
