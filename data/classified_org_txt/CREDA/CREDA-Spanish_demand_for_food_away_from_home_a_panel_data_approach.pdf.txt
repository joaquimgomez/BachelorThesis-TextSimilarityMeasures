Abstract: In this paper, the Spanish demand for food away from home is analysed. A panel 
data set is built and appropriate techniques for estimating limited dependent variable models 
have been applied. Results indicate that where there are zero expenditures, these are largely 
due to infrequency of purchase rather than to abstention or to economic reasons. Furthermore, 
important differences appear among households. On the one hand, those households whose 
head is a highly-educated person, male, young and living on a salary in a large town are more 
likely to purchase food away from home. On the other hand, increases in income only 
provokes more than proportional increases in expenditure for those households headed by an 
unschooled person, a female or a person older than 55 and also for those households with 
more than half of its members older than 60 years.

SPANISH DEMAND FOR FOOD AWAY FROM HOME: A PANEL DATA 
APPROACH 

 
 
1. Introduction 
  

Most Spanish literature on food demand has focused on consumption at home, 
ignoring any type of food consumption that takes place away from home. This simplifying 
assumption has not been unrealistic, since expenditure for food away from home (FAFH) has 
traditionally represented a small percentage of total food expenditure in Spain. Nevertheless, 
in recent years, food demand structure has changed sharply, and one of the most important 
changes has been the substantial increase of the FAFH expenditure share. In 1996, FAFH 
expenditures accounted for 25% of total food expenditure, while 20 years before it hardly 
reached 10%. Several factors can explain this change: the increasing percentage of women in 
the workforce, the growing number of households living on at least two income sources, the 
declining birth rate, the increasing number of one-person households, the significant decrease 
in the number of young married couples, and the longer life expectancy, among other factors. 
Clearly, these multiple demographic, social, economic and lifestyle changes have, in one way 
or another, generated an increase in the opportunity cost of consumers’ time which, in turn, 
has provoked an increasing demand for time-saving food products such as FAFH.  

 
Taking into account these new food trends, the objective of the paper is to provide a 

better understanding of all those economic and sociodemographic factors associated with 
Spanish FAFH expenditures. Results of this study should be of help to FAFH providers in 
forming better marketing strategies, anticipating future trends in the market, making better use 
of resources and identifying new business opportunities. Additionally, policy makers can 
apply these results so as to interpret changes in eating patterns as they apply to dietary quality 
and public health. Nutrition intervention programs or information and labelling legislation 
may be called for.  

 
In this paper the Spanish demand for FAFH will be analysed within the context of 

household production theory. This is not a new framework, other studies in the United States 
have also adopted this approach (Kinsey, 1983; McCracken and Brandt, 1987; Soberon-Ferrer 
and Dardis, 1991; Nayga and Capps, 1992; Yen, 1993; Nayga and Capps, 1995; or Jensen and 
Yen, 1996). For Spain, only Manrique and Jensen (1998) have analysed the FAFH 
expenditure using data from the Household Budget Survey 1990-91, elaborated by the 
Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), to which they applied switching regression 
techniques. However, all the above-mentioned studies have used cross-section data sets, 
which have certain limitations. Baltagi and Griffin (1995), among others, have shown that 
when only a pure time series data set is used, it is impossible to control for unobservable taste 
changes that occur over time. Cross-section data sets are unable to effectively control for 
individual-specific effects. Only when simultaneously considering the time and the cross-
sectional dimensions of data are researchers likely to obtain unbiased parameter estimates 
and, then, more reliable results. This is the approach which is going to be employed here 
using the information provided by the Quarterly Household Budget Survey1, also elaborated 
by the INE. 

                                                 
1 The Spanish Quarterly Household Budget Survey, conducted by the Instituto Nacional de 

Estadística, provides quarterly information on FAFH expenditure using a stratified random sample of 
households. It also gathers information on several economic and socio-demographic characteristics for

To best communicate our methods and results, the paper is organised as follows. The 

next section is devoted to the theoretical model on which the analysis will rely. In Section 3, 
the econometric techniques are explained. Following a brief description of the data in Section 
4, the main results are presented in Section 5. Lastly, the paper finishes with some concluding 
remarks.  

 
 
2. Theoretical model 
 
 The demand for FAFH can be appropriately analysed by making use of the household 
production theory (Becker, 1965; Lancaster, 1971) as the time component is especially 
relevant for this kind of demand. In household production theory, households are assumed to 
be both producing and utility-maximising units. Their decision-making process focuses on the 
efficient use of market goods, time and human capital as inputs for the production of utility-
yielding non-market goods.  
 
 Formally, every household maximises its utility function, specified as a function of the 
quantities of n commodities produced in the household, subject to the household production 
function, time constraints and full-income constraints, respectively:

where U refers to the household utility function; zi represents the quantities of commodity i 
produced in the household; x represents an n×1 vector of the quantities of market-purchased 
goods used in the production of commodity i; t represents an m×1 vector of time spent in the 
production of commodity i; E denotes a vector of variables reflecting the environment in 
which production takes place; tk denotes the total time available for household member k; tik 
represents the time spent by the household member k in the production of commodity i; twk 
represents the time spent working in market activities by the household member k; pi 
represents the price of xi; wk represents the household member k’s wage rate; and, finally, v 
denotes the non-wage income. 
 
 This model leads to household-derived market-good demand equations which are 
analogous to derived demand equations for factor inputs in traditional production theory 
(Becker, 1965):

these households. For each quarter, households are asked to record information related to a one-week 
period. One household stays eight consecutive quarters in the survey, theoretically. This information 
enables us to build a panel data set by including households remaining in the sample during a certain 
number of consecutive periods.

Here, Xih is the hth household’s consumption of the ith market good; Ph is the vector of 
market prices faced by the hth household; Yh is the hth household’s income; Wh is the amount 
of available time for the hth household and Eh is a vector of variables reflecting the 
environment. These environmental factors could reflect various household characteristics or 
socio-demographic elements (McCraken and Brandt, 1987). 
 
 If equation (2) is multiplied by Pih, as proposed by Yen (1993) and Nayga (1998), the 
expenditure functions are obtained and have the following form: 

),,( hhhiihihih EWYfPXEXP ==    i=1,2,...,n  (3) 
 

where the dependent variable EXPih represents the hth household’s weekly expenditure on 
market good i, with all prices normalised to unity. 

 
Due to data unavailability, some simplifying assumptions have been adopted in (3) so 

as to define the Spanish demand for FAFH. Since wages are not available, the number of 
wage earners within a household has been included to capture, together with income, the 
value of the opportunity cost of time2. Finally, we have included the following environmental 
variables, Eh, which we consider most likely to affect FAFH expenditure: 1) those related to 
the size and composition of the household; 2) the main characteristics of the head of the 
household (age, gender, education level or economic activity); and 3) some regional or type-
of-habitat variables.  
 
 
3. Econometric framework 
 

The estimation of model (3) to analyse the Spanish FAFH expenditure on the basis of 
a panel data set faces substantial econometric problems due to the large number of zero 
purchases reported by households. There are three main reasons for zero expenditures: i) 
consumers do not purchase the product at current prices and income levels (corner solution), 
ii) the survey period is too short to allow consumers to report any purchase of a specific 
product (infrequency of purchase) and, iii) consumers are not interested in buying the product 
(abstention). 

 
The consideration of zero responses has lately received increased attention by 

researchers, mainly as applied to cross-sectional analyses. The traditional Tobit Model has 
been found to be appropriate when zero purchases are caused only by economic factors such 
as high prices or low income (corner solutions). If zero expenditures are due to an infrequency 
of purchase, the Infrequency of Purchase Model (IP) must be used. If, in addition to this 
reason, there are some consumers who, having decided to participate in the market, in the end 
do not buy because of economic factors, the so-called Tobit Infrequency of Purchase Model 
(TIP) is the model of choice. Finally, if zero expenditure responses are due to either 
abstention or economic factors, the Double-Hurdle Model (DH) must be applied.  

 
In order to tackle the problem of incorporating censored dependent variables in a 

panel data framework, the two-stage process proposed by Chamberlain (1984) has been used. 
This technique has been recently used to analyse the Spanish demand for tobacco by Labeaga 
(1999). In the first stage, a distribution for the individual effects is specified and a reduced 
form model is estimated. In the second stage, a Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) 

                                                 
2  See Nayga (1998).

Within-Group estimator proposed by Bover and Arellano (1997) is computed. This procedure 
simultaneously deals with serial correlation, unobserved heterogeneity, the censored nature of 
the dependent variable and the presence of endogenous regressors. Moreover, this estimator is 
asymptotically equivalent to the Minimum Distance estimator with the advantage that it is not 
necessary to either specify the non-linear constraints on the reduced form or estimate the 
nuisance parameters.  

 
We will start by considering the initial model for the FAFH expenditure as represented 

by (3), within a panel data framework. First, since many households report zero expenditure, 
we denote the latent FAFH expenditure of household h in period t as EXP*ht. Though it is not 
directly observable, it is associated to the corresponding observable FAFH expenditure 
(EXPht). In fact, the observable EXPht is always some function of the unobservable EXP*ht. 
Second, since previous research clearly shows that Spaniards have habit persistence when it 
comes to their food demand (Gracia et al., 1998; Molina, 1994, among others), we have 
introduced some lags of the endogenous variable as additional regressors. Finally, we will 
follow the common practice of substituting income with total expenditure, since income data 
are highly suspect. In our case, as Labeaga (1999) pointed out, total expenditure must be 
considered an endogenous variable since it is measured with error because of including many 
zero expenditures on several goods infrequently purchased 
 

Consequently, we arrive at the following equation3:

where ( )''* 1* hthththt ZYEXPR MM−= ; ( )

''βγαδ MM= ; *htEXP and htY  are, as mentioned before, the 
latent FAFH expenditure4 and total expenditure, respectively; Zht is a k × 1 vector of 
exogenous variables such as that

and hη is an unobservable individual effect potentially correlated with Zht.   
 
 The result of not observing *htEXP  is that the conditional mean of the parameter vector 
will not be identified if additional assumptions concerning the conditional distribution of the 
error terms are not included. Following Chamberlain (1984) and Bover and Arellano (1997), 
we define an m × 1 vector of exogenous variables '''' 1 ),,...,,1( hhThh rZZV = , where rh is a vector 
of variables that includes non-linear terms in the Zht components as well as time independent 
variables. Three assumptions are made: 
 i) The expectation of hη  conditional on the values of the exogenous variables are 
parameterised as follows: 

( ) hhh VVE '| λη =                                                              (6) 
   

                                                 
3 Only one lag of the dependent variable is included in order not to lose many degrees of 

freedom. 
 
4 The inclusion of the lagged latent rather than the lagged observed variable is intended to 

capture probability effects as well as consumption habits.

ii) It is assumed that the conditional expectation of the initial value of the latent 
endogenous variable follows: 

( ) hhh VVEXPE '*1 | µ=                                                          (7) 
 
 iii) Finally, as total expenditure, htY , is considered to be an endogenous variable, the 
conditional expected value of htY  is assumed to be: 

( ) hhht VVYE 2| Π=                                                                    (8) 
 
 With these assumptions in mind, the complete reduced form of the model can be 
expressed in matrix notation as follows: 

( ) ( ) ),...,1(''

'''* NhVYEXP hhhh =+ΠΠ= εMM                              (9) 
 
where ( ) *'''* hhh RFYEXP =M  is a 2T × 1 vector; ( ) Π=ΠΠ ''2'1 M  is a 2T × m matrix; and hε is a 
new disturbance vector.   
 
 In order to estimate the reduced form (9), first stage of the Chamberlain’s (1984) 
procedure, different alternatives have been followed to get estimates of 1Π and 2Π matrices, 
respectively. To estimate 1Π , it has to be borne in mind that it is a parameter matrix of a 
reduced form of the type:  

 hhh VEXP ε+Π= 1
*                                                              (10) 

 
This expression follows model (4) where the endogenous variable htY  has been excluded. 
Thus, the estimation of 1Π  can be obtained by estimating T cross-section equations in 
reduced form (10)5 (Labeaga, 1999). Note that in this kind of cross-section estimation, it is 
necessary to take into account the nature of zero responses. Finally, 2Π is estimated by 
applying OLS to equation (8) (Bover and Arellano, 1997; Labeaga, 1999).  
 
 Once the first stage of the procedure is accomplished, the relevant vector of 
parameters δ  in model (4) is derived. Following Bover and Arellano (1997), these estimators 
are obtained as follows:

4. Data  
 

Data have been extracted from the Spanish Quarterly Household Budget Survey 
conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE). It provides information on 
expenditure for different types of products using a stratified random sample of 3,200 
households. It also gathers information on a limited number of household characteristics 
including the level of education and the main activity of the head of the household, household 
income, household size, age and sex of family members and town size. For each quarter, 
households are asked to record all information during one week. Theoretically, one household 
stays in the survey during eight quarters; however, there is a significant percentage of 



 7

households which do not remain for the whole theoretical period (Browing and Collado, 
1999). In this study, a panel is built by including only the households remaining in the sample 
during the last eight quarters that information is available (from the first quarter of 1995 to the 
fourth of 19966). The final sample includes information from the 217 households that have 
remained in the survey during all eight quarters mentioned.  

 
Finally, we have included the following variables in our models: 1) education level 

(unschooled, primary school, secondary school and post secondary degree); 2) age (less than 
35 years old, between 36 and 55, and more than 55 years old); 3) gender; 4) employment 
status (self-employed, employed and unemployed); 5) size of the town where the household 
lives7 (less than 10,000 inhabitants, between 10,001 and 50,000 inhabitants, between 50,001 
and 500,000 inhabitants, and more than 500,000 inhabitants); 6) number of wage earners in 
the household; 7) size of the household; and 8) household composition8. 
 
5. Results 
 
 In this section we are going to present the results of Chamberlain’s (1984) two-step 
procedure mentioned in Section 3. We first estimate expression (9), which, in fact, means to 
estimate the 1Π and 2Π matrices. As previously mentioned, to estimate the parameters of the 

1Π matrix, it is necessary to carry out eight cross-section reduced form regressions as shown 
in (10). However, in this case, we have to take into account the nature of the dependent 
variables. So, it is imperative to decide what is the most appropriate specification in relation 
to zero FAFH expenditures. The Voung (1989) test has been used to select between the Tobit, 
IP, TIP and DH models9. Results indicate that among the alternative models during the eight 
quarters, the IP model better fits the data10. Moreover, in order to detect possible 
misspecification, the Chesher (1983, 1984) score test interpretation of the White (1982) 
information matrix test has been used to test for normality and heteroscedasticity both jointly 
and individually (skewness, kurtosis and heteroscedasticity). The selected models were 
properly specified since the null hypothesis of normality and homocedastic errors could not 
                                                 

6 In 1997 the methodology used to collect information changed, so it still is not possible to get 
homogeneous information for a sufficiently large period. 

 
7 The inclusion of this variable is mainly due to the importance of including some regional 

effects in the analysis. No other regional variable is included in the survey. 
 
8 Household composition is measured by the percentage of household members aged: i) 

between 1 and 13 years old (% child); ii) between 14 and 29 years old (% adolescent); iii) between 30 
and 59 (% adult); and iv) 60 and above (% elderly).  

 
9 It is assumed that consumers decide separately to buy and how much to buy. Therefore, 

independent versions of the models have been estimated. In all models in which two decisions are 
made (IP, TIP and DH), the following variables are included in the participation equation: age, gender, 
level of education, employment status and town size. In the second equation, the expenditure equation, 
the size and composition of the household as well as the number of earners in the household have also 
been included. The per capita expenditure is not included as it is considered an endogenous variable 
and, as mentioned in a previous section, it will be explicitly modelled through equation (8) 
( 2Π parameters).

be rejected (all the score results lie between 47.8 and 59.3, lower than the critical value at the 
5% level of significance, )44(2χ = 60.48). These results indicate that FAFH zero 
expenditures in Spain are generated because the purchase cycle is longer than the survey 
period length. These results are important since we can now clearly state that neither 
abstention nor corner solutions explain the zero responses. That is, Spanish consumers seem 
to like eating food away from home, and neither prices nor income are an important limitation 
for them. Injecting here a bit of a cultural observation, at least in Spain, an important share of 
FAFH expenditure is surely associated with leisure and socialising activities where a great 
diversity of prices serve the consumer’s heterogeneity.  
 
 Although the estimates made up to this point have to be understood only as 
“preliminary”, some conclusions can be drawn in relation to the participation equation, taking 
into account the sociodemographic variables which have been included in that equation. Since 
all the exogenous variables included in the model are binary, their effects on the participation 
in the FAFH market are calculated as marginal effects. Results for the years under study are 
shown in Table 1.   

 
(Insert Table 1) 

 
As can be observed, despite some quarterly variations, there seems to exist quite a 

stable behaviour during the period analysed. In general, the higher the level of education of 
the head of household, the higher is the probability of participation in the FAFH market. In 
relation to gender effects, most of the values are positive. Purchasing FAFH is more a male 
activity, which probably has to do with the still low percentage of women working out of the 
home. Regarding age, it is observed that those households headed by a person younger than 
55 are more likely to purchase FAFH. The employment status also exerts a significant 
influence on the probability of participation, unemployed people being the least likely to 
purchase this type of food. Finally, as far as the effect of the town size, the highest probability 
of purchasing FAFH is found for those households living in towns with between 10,001 and 
50,000 inhabitants, followed by those living in the largest towns (reference category of towns 
with more than 500,000 inhabitants). This picture is quite consistent with certain socio-
demographic studies carried out on the Spanish population. 

  
Finally, to obtain the necessary remaining component for the second step of 

Chamberlain’s (1984) procedure (the 2Π parameters), equation (8) has been estimated by 
OLS including the same explanatory variables as used in the expenditure equation of the IP 
model. 

 
Proceeding, expressions (11) and (12) are used to calculate the parameters of interest 

in the consumption equation, equation (4), as well as their standard deviations. However, 
since the variables are expressed in deviations with respect to mean times, all time-invariant 
variables disappear in the equation. Thus, the only explanatory variables that remain are the 
lag of the FAFH expenditure and the total per capita expenditure. The estimated parameters of 
the lagged FAFH expenditure parameter equalled 0.124 with a t-statistic of 3.86, while the 
total per capita expenditure parameter was 0.004 with a t-statistic of 1.97. Hence, both 
estimates had the expected signs and were significant at the 5% level of significance. 
 

One of the most interesting benefits of estimating the model on individual household 
data is the possibility to compute elasticities for every household in the sample, for the desired 
time period. In this study, short- and long-run income elasticities for the whole sample have 



 9

been calculated as well as a breakdown by education, gender, age, employment status, size of 
the residence town, size and composition of the household and finally, by the number of 
income earners in the household. All of them have been calculated for the mean time period. 
The results are shown in Table 2. 
 

(Insert Table 2) 
 

As a result of the sign and magnitude of the lagged FAFH expenditure parameter, all 
long-run income elasticities are slightly higher than the corresponding short-run ones. This 
result confirms the a priori assumption of the habit persistence nature of FAFH demand. 
Elasticities calculated for the whole sample indicate that FAFH can be considered a necessity 
good. A permanent 10% increase in income only yields an increase of 7.99% in FAFH 
expenditure. Nevertheless, important differences in income elasticities appear for households 
with different socio-demographic characteristics. The higher the level of education, the lower 
the income elasticities are. In fact, for those unschooled household heads, FAFH turns out to 
be a luxury product. The effect of the age of the household head is also relevant. As the head 
of the household gets older, income elasticities increase. Concerning the employment status, it 
is observed that the lowest elasticities correspond to employed workers while, obviously, the 
highest values correspond to those households headed by an unemployed person. All results 
mentioned above are quite consistent with those expected, taking into account differences 
related to household characteristics. In general terms, any characteristic associated with 
someone of higher income level is also associated with lower expenditure elasticities.  
 

The breakdown by town size indicates that elasticities are higher for those households 
living in the smallest towns. This result could also be explained by differences in average 
income levels. In rural areas, the smallest towns, the average income level is lower than in 
larger towns, which is consistent with higher expenditure elasticities. As regards differences 
related to household size, the lowest elasticities are associated with one-member households, 
but all values are quite similar. Nevertheless, household size must be always analysed in 
relation to household composition. For that reason, elasticities for households composed of 
different percentages of children, adolescents, adults and elderly have been calculated. The 
most remarkable results are that FAFH is a luxury product for those households with a 
percentage of elderly over 50%. That is, the presence of elderly persons in the household 
considerably increases income elasticities. On the other end of the age scale, the effect made 
by children is not so relevant. Finally, as the percentage of adolescents within the household 
increases, income elasticities lower considerably. It is notable that in those households with 
more than 75% adolescents, the long-run elasticity is only 0.315. Finally, analysing the effect 
of the number of income earners, results show that the smallest elasticity corresponds to those 
households with more than three earners. The only exception to this rule is seen for a small 
sample percentage of non-earners. The effect produced by this variable may also be reflecting, 
as in the case of other socio-demographic characteristics, the more generalized effect of 
differences in average income levels. 
 
 
6. Concluding remarks  
 
 In this paper, the Spanish demand for FAFH has been analysed within the household 
production theoretical framework using a panel data approach. Since most literature dealing 
with the demand for FAFH has been based on cross-section data, this paper has tried to offer a 
new analytical perspective. The high percentage of zero expenditures has made it necessary to 



 10

carefully select the appropriate limited dependent variable models used. The obtained results 
are quite consistent with the expected behaviour of Spanish households and provide a clear 
picture of FAFH consumer behaviour. This pattern will be of great interest for all economic 
agents involved in this growing sector.  

 
Results suggest a number of points. We begin with a comment regarding the 

infrequent character of FAFH purchasing. Since households have to record their expenditures 
during only one week, results suggest that the purchase cycle is longer than a week for the 
vast majority of the sample. Moreover, since neither abstention nor corner solutions explain 
the zero expenditures, we can assume that if consumers enjoy going out to consume food, 
then there exists a wide range of places with different prices which could satisfy any potential 
demand according with their socio-economic profile.  
 
 Results also provide evidence of significant differences regarding participation and 
expenditure behaviour between households. In general, household heads with a higher level of 
education, males, young and living on a salary in large towns are all more likely to purchase 
FAFH. As regards expenditure, results show that an increase in income only provokes more 
than proportional increases in FAFH expenditure for those households headed by an 
unschooled person, a female or a person older than 55 and also for those households with 
more than half of its members older than 60 years. For the rest of the households, FAFH is a 
necessity good. 
 
 Further interesting research could be carried out if more desegregated data were 
available for prices and/or type of facilities (i.e. restaurant, tavern, fast food, etc.). This 
information could then be used to provide further insight into the Spanish demand for FAFH 
and predict marketing and future conditions for the FAFH industry. Therefore, future efforts 
will be aimed at these objectives.
