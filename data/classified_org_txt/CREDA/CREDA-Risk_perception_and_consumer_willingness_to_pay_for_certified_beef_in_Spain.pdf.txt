Abstract 

Food scares have increased consumer food safety concern, particularly for beef. 

Traceability and food quality labels have been put in place to communicate to consumers the 

safety characteristics of the specially labelled beef in hopes of recovering confidence and  

consumption. As a consequence, production costs have increased, and thereby consumer 

prices as well. In this paper we develop a conceptual model capable of analysing the main 

factors influencing consumers’ willingness to pay for certified beef. A three-equation 

recursive model is jointly estimated which accounts for the main steps in the consumer 

decision process. Results indicate that income, level of beef consumption, the average price 

consumers pay for beef and the perception of beef safety are the main determinants of Spanish 

consumers’ willingness to pay for certified beef. 

Key words: Certified beef, willingness-to-pay, attitudes, food safety, Spain.

RISK PERCEPTION AND CONSUMER WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR 
CERTIFIED BEEF IN SPAIN 

 

 

 

1. Introduction 

In recent years, both the supply and the demand for food products have experienced 

important changes. On the supply side, a new technological revolution is taking place, which 

has substantially increased the number of food products available to the final consumer. But 

these technological processes have become increasingly complex, generating new concerns 

about their long-term effect on the environment and the human health (e.g. GMOs). On the 

demand side, food markets in developed countries, especially in Europe, are facing some 

marketing problems mainly related to consumer loss of confidence in the food supply chain.  

Recent food scares have increased consumers’ concerns for food safety causing 

significant reductions in the consumption of affected products. As a consequence, the food 

industry has designed tracing systems and increased vertical coordination to guarantee food 

safety along the food supply chain. Moreover, policy makers have reinforced controls and 

strengthened the role of food safety agencies. Partly due to these changes, many authors in 

recent years have started to analyse consumers’ increasing concerns about food safety and its 

effect on food choices (Wessells et al, 1996; Cowan, 1998; Verbeke and Viaene, 1999, 2001; 

Porin and Mainsant, 1998; Henson and Northen, 2000, among others).  

In Europe, food safety concerns have been particularly important in the beef sector where 

consumption was reduced due to BSE crisis in 2000. While the short-term impact (during the 

following two or three months) varied, in all cases consumption fell off substantially: France 

lost 40%; Germany, 60%; Italy, 42%; and Portugal, 30% (Agra Europe, 2001). For Spain, 

beef consumption slid downward from 1994 (MAPA, 2004) and then recovered in 1999 and 



 2 

2000 (Figure 1)1. However, this recovery ended with the first case of BSE in Spain in October 

of 2000. Between 2000 and 2001, beef consumption decreased annually by 12%. However, in 

the very short run the impact was substantially large (beef consumption decreased from 22 

million Kg, in October 2000, to 15.8 million Kg, in December 2000).  

(Insert Figure 1) 

Spanish producers, manufacturers and policy makers have all participated in the effort to 

recover beef consumption. Product quality systems and controls have been strengthened to 

improve beef safety perception. However, food safety is a credence attribute (it is almost 

impossible for consumers to confirm the safety level of food even after purchasing). Thus, 

consumers have to rely on intrinsic and extrinsic cues to infer food safety. Among the 

extrinsic cues, traceability and/or quality labels have been implemented both at European and 

national levels as a strategy to certify the safety characteristics of the labelled beef. The main 

objective of these policies has been to transform food safety from a credence attribute to a 

search attribute. 

For Spanish beef, the PDOs (Protected Designation of Origin) have been emphasized in 

promotional campaigns, highlighting the quality and safety attributes of products from a 

particular region. Moreover, in 2003, the Spanish government began regulating beef 

traceability and labelling2. After two years of transition, mandatory traceability was 

introduced in 2005. 

Reinforced controls or, at least, a more strict application of already existing regulations, 

have increased production marginal costs at the producer, wholesale and retail levels. These 

increases are ultimately transmitted to consumers through higher prices. As shown in Figure 

1, consumer beef prices increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, even when the demand 

                                                 
1 Note beef consumption away-from-home is not included.  
2 The Spanish legislation is based on the Council Regulation (CE) 1760/2000 and the Commission Regulation 
(CE) 1825/2000.

was lower due to the BSE crisis mentioned above 3. Often, major food companies reduce 

prices or create special offers to maintain sales volume during periods of poor consumer 

confidence in a product (Yeung and Morris, 2001). Consumers may be willing to take risks at 

a discounted price, but less so when their health is the risk. It seems more likely that the bulk 

of consumers who are willing to continue buying beef even during periods of safety concern 

are those who are willing to pay marginally higher prices in exchange for some kind of 

quality assurance that reduces their perceived health risk. At any rate, this is the question we 

are investigating. 

The specific objective of this paper is to see if and, then, how much more Spanish 

consumers are willing to pay for labelled beef as relates to risk perception and confidence in 

food safety. Moreover, the paper aims to discover the main factors in this consumer decision 

process. 

Several studies have already examined this issue for meat or other food products (Fisher, 

1995; Buzby et al., 1998; Caswell, 1998; Latouche et al, 1998; Zanetti, 1998; Sánchez et al, 

2001, among others). However, no attempt has been made in the literature to simultaneously 

consider all the steps in the consumer decision process. Drawing on a review of research 

literature, we have developed a conceptual model that links consumer: 1) confidence in food 

safety; 2) perceived risk for beef; and 3) willingness to pay for labelled beef as an extrinsic 

cue of reduced perceived risk. The three equations are jointly estimated by maximum 

likelihood, allowing for simultaneity in consumers’ decisions, which is the main novelty of 

our approach, from a methodological point of view. Data used in this study come from a 

nation-wide telephone survey conducted in the spring of 2003. 

                                                 
3 In 2002, prices increased by 10% and consumption recovered even above past levels. However, in this case, 
beef consumption was mainly favoured by an increase in the perceived risk of lamb meat due to the foot and 
mouth crisis in the UK sheep sector.

Organisationally, we first review the research literature on the relationship between risk 

perception and consumer purchasing intentions. This forms the base on which we develop our  

conceptual model. Second, we outline our data source and the design of the questionnaire, 

which yields some preliminary and descriptive results. Third, the econometric framework 

used to estimate the model is described. Fourth, results from the estimated model are 

presented, followed by our conclusions. 

 

2. Risk perception and willingness to pay for improvements in food safety 

Nowadays, consumers figure at least twice in the food supply chain: they are situated at 

the end of the chain as the end user, and at the start of the chain as inspiration for a consumer-

driven or market-oriented chain organisation (Gellynck et al, 2004). Recent studies have 

explored consumers’ preferences for mandatory and voluntary beef labelling programs 

associated with credence attributes (Alfnes and Rickersten, 2003; Lusk et al., 2001; Roosen, 

Lusk and Fox, 2003; Enneking, 2004; Loureiro and Umberger, 2004). Most of them explore 

alternative methodologies to elicit willingness to pay for credence attributes (e.g. contingent 

valuation, choice experiments, experimental auctions). However, from a policy-making 

perspective, it is necessary not only to understand whether proposed public policies in the 

area of traceability may pass a cost-benefit analysis but also to know what the main factors 

are that explain those preferences.  

Food choice is often influenced more by the psychological interpretation of product 

properties than the physical properties of products themselves (Rozin et al., 1986). Perception 

of food safety risk is one such psychological interpretation (Yeung and Morris, 2001). 

Perceived risk theory was initially used by marketing researchers to understand the effect on 

consumer behaviour of making purchase decisions for cases of imperfect information (Bauer, 



 5 

1967; Cox, 1967; Cunningham, 1967; Roselius, 1971; Taylor, 1974; Mitchell and Greatorex, 

1988; Yavas, 1992; Agrawal, 1995; Mitra et al., 1999; Tse, 1999; among others). However, 

none of them analysed specific hazards. 

In the context of potentially harmful situations, risk is technically defined as “a 

combination of the probability, or frequency of occurrence of a defined hazard and the 

magnitude of the consequences of the occurrence” (HMSO, 1995). Total or overall perceived 

risk for a specific product is a combination of a fixed component, the product category risk 

(PCR), and a variable component, the product specific risk (PSR) (Dowling and Staelin, 

1994). In other words, the perceived risk associated with beef is the result of the overall 

consumer confidence in food safety and that which is related to beef safety.  

In relation to the overall consumer confidence on food safety, since it is prohibited to 

place unsafe food on the market (The European Parliament and The Council of The European 

Union, 2002), it is likely that consumers generally expect that food products are safe. 

Therefore, in the absence of food scares, we can say that food safety in general is taken for 

granted by consumers. In any case, the literature indicates that, overall, consumer confidence 

in food safety differs according to: demographic and socio-economic factors such as age, 

educational level and economic status; consumer trust in regulatory institutions and 

participants in the food supply chain; the occurrence of food safety incidents and consumer 

knowledge about food safety issues through labels or media coverage (De Jonge et al., 2004). 

Apart from the overall consumer confidence in food safety, the perceived risk associated 

with beef also depends on specific incidents related to this product. Good examples are the 

hormone abuse in the meat sector, exemplified by the illegal use of the bovine growth 

hormone clenbuterol, and the fear that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) might have 

significant impacts on human health. However, external incidents have only a variable effect 

on risk perception and consumer behaviour. Verbeke (2001) reported that after the BSE crisis, 



 6 

consumers intended to decrease beef consumption in the future. Then, in a follow-up study, 

after the dioxin scare, the consumer image of poultry and pork was negatively affected, 

whereas the safety perception of beef improved after it had been initially damaged by the BSE 

scare. This result indicates that, although it can be assumed that consumers’ overall 

confidence on food safety can affect risk perception of a specific product, we cannot 

necessarily conclude that safety perceptions related to a particular product category influence 

general consumer confidence in the safety of food (De Jonge et al., 2004). 

Besides general consumer confidence in food safety and external incidents, some other 

factors may contribute to perceived product risk (safe ty). Price is one of the most important. 

The effect of price on perceived quality has been investigated by Jacoby et al. (1971, 1977), 

Mitchell and Greatorex (1989), Malone (1990), Asher (1992), Gotlieb and Sarel (1992) and 

Narasimban et al. (1993). Surprisingly, Roselius (1971) and Akaah and Korgaonkar (1988) 

found that higher price leads to higher perceived risk. Previous consumer experience in 

buying beef, their image of certain brand names (Richardson et al., 1996) and the image of the 

store from which the product is bought (Roselius, 1971) are other factors that may influence 

risk perception. 

Many studies have attempted to measure risk perception. Stone and Grounhaug (1993) 

classified the components of perceived risk as: financial, psychological, social, performance, 

physical and time-related. Risk components have been measured using a range of scalar 

quantities corresponding to “low” through “high” risk. Total perceived risk can be obtained 

using a weighted average which takes into account the relative importance of each component 

from a consumer perspective. However, with only a few exceptions like Festervand et al. 

(1986), Henthorne et al. (1990) and Murray and Schlacter (1990), most studies have looked at 

perceived risk without breaking it down into its constituent components, hereby defining a 

single scalar quantity to measure the overall perceived risk, as we will be doing in this study.  



 7 

If consumer perceived risk exceeds a certain threshold or tolerance level, then one or 

more risk-reduction strategies (risk relievers) will be employed to reduce the amount of 

perceived risk to a tolerable level (Mitchell, 1998): seeking for information from formal or 

informal sources, using brand image or price as a quality guide or shopping in a very 

reputable store (Lee et al., 2000). Roselius (1971) and Derbaix (1983) discuss the most 

relevant risk relievers indicating that some of them are more effective than others in reducing 

the perceived risk associated with particular products.  

Where food safety is concerned, certification strategies (traceability or quality labels) 

have been developed to improve consumer perception of food safety, which ultimately 

generates consumer price increases. Some consumers will be willing to pay higher beef prices 

to reassure safety but others will trade off price against the safety improvement. Apart from 

socioeconomic characteristics, it is expected that risk perception associated with beef is one of 

the main driving forces for the premiums as shown in Loureiro and Umberger (2004). 

The preceding review of the literature can be used to construct a conceptual model for 

consumer purchase decision-making of beef, as it is influenced by food safety (Figure 2). The 

overall consumer confidence in food safety, together with some external factors related to 

beef, is the main determinant of the perception of beef safety. Moreover, beef scares also have 

an indirect influence on the overall confidence on food safety. Empirical evidence during food 

scares and, to a lesser extent, the literature supports the contention that, other things being 

equal, there is a negative correlation between risk perception and purchase likelihood (Yeung 

and Morris, 2001). If perceived risk is high enough, they draw on a risk reducing strategies 

such as safety assured products which involve paying a marginal higher price. Consumer 

socioeconomic characteristics, the level of perceived risk, their purchasing behaviour before 

the incidents and their confidence on certification strategies will, ultimately, determine the 



 8 

premium they are willing to pay, if any. A similar model could be used for alternative safety 

and quality assurance policies.

3. Survey, sampling and questionnaire design 

The data was collected during a nation-wide telephone survey using computer-assisted 

telephone interview (CATI) technology. Interviewers were constantly monitored throughout 

the survey period. The interviews were conducted during the spring of 2003. The average 

interview lasted 16 minutes.  

Potential respondents were selected using national random digit dialling across the 6 

broad geographical regions considered in the National Food Survey conducted by the 

Ministry of Agriculture (North West, North East, Madrid and surroundings, East, Centre and 

South). Population estimates from The National Institute of Statistics (INE) determined the 

call distribution necessary for proportionate geographic coverage. 

Only respondents over 18 years old responsible for household food shopping were 

selected. The sample was randomly selected although a quota system was established to 

guarantee that the sample represented Spain’s geographic and age distribution. A total of 4238 

phone calls resulted in 650 valid responses. The sampling error rate was ±3.9%.  

The sample was 30% male and 70% female. Respondent median age was 45, where 28% 

of respondents were younger than 35; 28% were between 35 and 49; 23% were between 50 

and 65; and 21% were older than 65. The average household size was 3.1, a little bit higher 

than the INE estimate of 2.9.  

Most respondents (74%) had completed primary or high school. About 16% had 

completed some university degree and the remainder (10%) had not obtained the minimum of 



 9 

a primary school diploma. A little less than half (46%) said their total monthly household 

income was between 900 and 1,500 Euros while another 35% earn between 1,500 and 3,000 

Euros. About 18% of respondents earn less than 900 Euros and for the remaining 4% the 

monthly household income was greater than 3,000 Euros.  

The questionnaire was structured into four main blocks, following the conceptual model 

presented in the previous section. As is often the case with questionnaires, the survey includes 

a balanced mixture covering past behaviour and intention to behave as a proxy for actual 

behaviour, so, validity cannot be fully guaranteed. Attitudes and perceptions were elicited 

through a 5-point Likert scale. Multi-scale questions  were used to measure attitudes while 

single-scale questions were used to measure the perceived risk associated to specific food 

products. Finally, the Chronbach’s Alpha was used to check the reliability of the multi-scale 

responses.  

The first block of the questionnaire was an introductory one and addressed consumer 

concerns about food safety, how information had been received and to what extent food habits 

had changed. Results from the survey indicate that food scares that have taken place in 

Europe in the last years, specially the BSE, have substantially increased consumer concerns 

about food safety in Spain. As Table 1 shows, 63% of the respondents declared to be more 

concerned about food safety now than five years ago. If only the problem per se is considered, 

this result seems somewhat surprising, at least from a rational point of view, and some other 

factors have to be found to explain it. Without any doubt, mass media coverage of recent food 

scares is the biggest influence on consumer behaviour. In a multi-choice question, around 

90% of the respondents declared TV as a source of information on food safety issues, 60% 

through radio and 50% through newspapers, while less than 20% stated that they have 

received information through doctors, health-specialised magazines or family. Moreover, 52% 



 10 

of the respondents recognize that mass media exerts a high influence in their shopping and 

consumption habits while the remainder deny that influence or “do not know”. 

To what extent increasing concerns on food safety have modified shopping behaviour  is 

shown at the bottom of Table 1. It seems that, although positively correlated, consumers’ 

concerns have not been corroborated by changes in food habits of the same magnitude. In any 

case, almost half of respondents declared to have changed their shopping habits, which is a 

relatively high percentage. Respondents, then, were asked in what way they had changed. 

Around 81% of them had given up buying the product, 40% had started to read food labels 

more carefully, 28.5% had moved to brands which offered them more confidence or 

guarantees and, finally, 4% had changed the retail outlet where they normally shop.  

(Insert Table 1) 

In the second block, the questionnaire collected information about overall consumer 

attitude towards food safety and the safety consumers perceived towards buying various food 

products, being beef one of them. Table 2 shows consumers’ general attitudes towards food 

safety, using a five-point scale. Items were taken from Henson and Traill (2000) and the last 

item was used as a general statement for the purpose of validating construct. As can be 

observed, Spanish consumers associa te food safety with the existence of a clearly indicated 

expiration date. In general, they perceived that food products are not as safe as they should be 

and feel that they do not have enough information to assess food safety before buying it. 

Finally, consumers have serious doubts about food safety in processing plants, food handling 

in restaurants, and some concerns about the healthiness of certain commonly used additives. 

(Insert Table 2) 

Results mentioned above indicate that single product food scares also adversely affect 

consumer confidence in the food supply chain in general. But the largest negative effect of a 



 11 

food scare is on the specific products involved in the scare. We have tried to further explore 

this point by asking respondents about their perceived safety of selected groups of products. 

Results are shown in Table 3 using a five point-scale.  Respondents declared a higher than 

normal loss of confidence in meat products, canned food, preserved food, ready-to-eat meals 

and imported food. Moreover, the standard deviations associated with these products are 

higher than other product categories, indicating a heightened variability among consumer 

perceptions. Finally, note that beef is considered as the most risky food product, and at the 

same time has the highest standard deviation. 

(Insert Table 3) 

The third block dealt specifically with traceability and certification. After explaining to 

consumers what traceability meant4, a direct valuation method called contingent valuation or 

CV, was used to elicit consumer willingness to pay (WTP) a premium for certified beef. We 

have chosen, as the reference product, the most commonly consumed class of beef (Añojo 

1ªA) (MAPA, 2004). Of the different question formats used to collect information on WTP, a 

mixed procedure, normally called “closed-ended with follow-up” was selected. The procedure 

consists of a dichotomous choice (DC) question and a maximum WTP question. In the DC 

question, consumers were asked whether or not they are willing to pay an extra amount of 

money for buying the labelled beef, expressed as a percentage over the price they actually are 

paying (we ask explicitly for that price in the survey). To reduce possible biases, five initial 

bids or extra amounts were used (+10%, +20%, +30%, +40% and +50%). Consumers were 

randomly offered one of the five possible bids (130 respondents for each bid). Responses 

were YES if the individual was willing to pay at least the bid or NO, otherwise. After, they 

were asked for the exact maximum amount of money they were willing to pay. Taking into 

                                                 
4 We have used the definition provided by Smith et al. (2000) who define meat traceability as the ability to 
identify the origin of animals or meat as far back in the production sequence as necessary to ascertain ownership, 
identify parentage, assure safety and determine compliance in branded or source-verified beef programs. 



 12 

account the answers to the two questions, 73% of the respondents were not willing to pay a 

higher marginal price for labelled beef with a traceability certificate. 

The questionnaire ended with some questions related with the demographic and socio-

economic characteristics of respondents. 

 

4. Econometric framework 

Taking into account Figure 2, in this paper, a recursive model is estimated to determine 

the main factors explaining risk perception and consumer willingness to pay for certified beef. 

The three equations are:  

a) Overall consumer confidence of food safety 

b) Risk perception for beef 

c) Willingness to pay for certified beef 

The first two dependent variables (general attitudes towards food safety and perceived 

safety for beef) are categorical variables. In the first one, we have considered respondents’ 

valuations, on a five-point scale, to the general item included at the bottom of Table 25. In the 

second one, an ordered five-point scale measured their perception of beef safety, with 5 

indicating a risk perception of “very safe” (see table 3 for average values). In both cases, the 

original five-point scale was reduced to a three-point one, since only a few respondents chose 

the two extreme values. 

Finally, the willingness-to-pay equation has been specified as a two-step decision process 

taking into account the results obtained from the two consecutive questions. First, consumers 

decide if they are willing to pay a premium for certified beef over the price they are actually 

                                                 
5 To check for the adequacy of chosen the general item, we have carried out a factor analysis with first 7 items of 
the construct. Two factors were obtained, which were highly correlated with the general statement (0.91 and 
0.74, in absolute values, respectively). 



 13 

paying. Second, if they are willing to pay, they decide how much more. Premiums are 

expressed as a percentage price increase over the prices they are normally paying.  

Taking these issues into account, four dependent variables have been defined: confidence 

in food safety ( iFS ), risk perception for beef ( iBS ), whether an individual is willing to pay a 

premium for labelled beef ( iP ) and, finally, the price premium consumers would pay over the 

price they are actually paying for beef ( iPP ). These four variables are modelled as a recursive 

system such that iBS  is explained by iFS ; and iP  and iPP  are explained by iBS , as shown in 

Figure 2. In what follows, vectors of explanatory variables FSix , 
BS
ix  , 

P
ix  and 

PP

explain confidence in food safety, perceived safety for beef, willingness to pay for labelled 

beef and how much consumers are willing to pay, respectively, with corresponding parameter 

vectors  FSβ , BSβ  , Pβ  and PPβ  and random errors FSiε , 
BS
iυ  , 

P

PP
iυ . 

The overall attitude towards food safety ( iFS ) is a categorical variable. As mentioned 

above, the original five-point scale has been transformed to an ordered categorical variable 

with three categories (low, medium and high). Consequently, this variable has been 

categorised by an ordered polychotomous response model:

 14 

Perceived safety for beef ( iBS ) is a categorical variable, measuring consumer perception 

of beef safety. Also, three ordered degrees have been considered (low, medium and high) and, 

hence, it has also been categorised by an ordered polychotomous response model:

Willingness to pay is modelled using a sample selection model (Heckman, 1979). The 

first participation component, whether a consumer is willing to pay or not,  is modelled as a

5. Results 

5.1. Data and Variable Definitions 

 Since the estimation procedure described in the Appendix is rather complex, as it is 

highly nonlinear, we first estimated each equation individually to have an idea which would 

be the most relevant explanatory variables that should be included in each equation, also 

taking into account the conceptual model shown in Figure 2, and the literature review 

presented in Section 2. The complete list of variables included in the model is shown in Table 

47. 

The first four variables are the endogenous ones. Only 27% of respondents are willing to 

pay a positive amount for labelled beef to increase its safety level. As a consequence, the 

average price premium is only 5% over prices consumers are actually paying for beef. Among 

the explanatory variables, we have considered the socio-economic characteristics of 

respondents (income, education level and geographical location), which can influence any of 

the three dependent variables included in the model. The overall confidence in food safety, as 

mentioned in Section 3, is also determined by the effect that the mass media has on consumer 

buying behaviour, since this is the traditional source through which Spanish consumers have 

received information on food safety issues. We have also considered three variables related to 

actual beef purchasing behaviour: the price consumers are actually paying and two related to 

experience: the consumption level and the buying frequency).

7 Table 4 only includes explanatory variables that have resulted significant in at least one of the equations. The 
complete list of explanatory variables can be obtained from authors upon request, as well as the full 
questionnaire used.

Finally, since the traceability certificate is included in the product’s label, we have 

included one dichotomous dummy variable related to the attention consumers pay to labels 

and their confidence in the information included in them. Actually, this variable is the result 

of jointly considering the responses of two consecutive questions posed to consumers. In the 

first one, respondents were asked about how often they read food labels (five-point scale). In 

the second, they were asked about their confidence in them (five-point scale).  This variable 

takes the value 1, if the respondent reads labels often or very often (values of 4 and 5) and is 

confident or very confident with the information included (values of 4 and 5), and 0, 

otherwise. 

(Insert Table 4) 

5.2. Estimation results 

In Table 5 estimated parameters for the four-equation model are shown. In general terms, 

the signs of parameters are quite consistent with expectations. Among socio-economic 

characteristics of respondents, only education and income levels are influential, and only in 

some of the equations. More precisely, education is significant in explaining overall consumer 

confidence in food safety, while income is relevant in the willingness-to-pay equations. 

Results from the first equation suggest three main points. First, education is positively 

correlated with confidence in food safety. Respondents with a higher level of education seem 

to perceive food safer. Second, there is a negative relationship between product confidence 

and a high influence of mass media on purchase behaviour. When a food scare occurs, trust in 

information provided by mass media amplifies the negative perception of food safety. This 

result is consistent with those found by Loob et al. (2006) for UK consumers. On the positive 

side of consumer confidence, those consumers who regularly pay attention to food labels and 

feel confident about the information there, feel more confident about food safety. Finally, 



 17 

consumers living in the Southern Spain seem to be less satisfied with the existing food safety 

standards. 

The perceived risk for beef is positively and significantly determined by the overall 

confidence in food safety, as suggested by Dowling and Stalin (1994). The two variables 

related to beef consumption before beef scares (frequency of purchasing and per capita 

consumption level) are also positively associated with the perceived safety for beef, as in 

Gellynck et al. (2006). This result indicates that the more experienced consumers probably 

have had access to alternative sources of additional information and trust more in the food 

safety information provided by public authorities. As a result, the impact of beef scares on 

these consumers has been very limited and their perception about beef safety has even 

increased. The second interesting result is the relationship between the price consumers are 

actually paying for beef and consumers’ safety perception of this product. This relationship is 

negative, indicating that higher prices lead to higher perceived risk as in Roselius (1971) and 

Akaah and Korgaonkar (1988). 

Finally, results obtained in the last stage of the procedure are also quite interesting. As 

mentioned before, this stage consists of estimating two equations. In the first one, the 

probability of willingness to pay for a premium for label-certified beef is analyzed. Three 

types of explanatory variables are relevant: First, the consumer perception of beef safety, a 

variable which will also allow us to corroborate the recursive structure of the estimated model 

and confirm the results found by Loureiro and Umberger (2004) for US consumers. This 

variable is negatively related to the probability of paying a premium, indicating that as the 

beef is perceived safer the need to pay a premium diminishes. The second set of variables is 

related to the level of consumption. In this case, more experienced consumers before beef 

incidents are more likely to be willing to pay the premium after those incidents. Finally, as 

consumer income increases, they are more likely to pay a premium for certified beef.  



 18 

(Insert Table 5) 

In the second equation, for those who have answered positively to the first equation, the 

main determinants of the exact overprice consumers are willing to pay are considered. As 

mentioned above, the average premium is relatively low (5%). Explanatory variables are the 

same as in the first equation although some signs have changed, which is not inconsistent. In 

this case, once consumers have decided to pay a premium, the amount varies inversely with 

the consumption level. This is not surprising since household food expenditure is constrained. 

Income level is also positively associated with price premiums. As mentioned in the previous 

paragraph, consumers who perceive beef as safe enough to eat are less likely to pay a 

premium for certified beef. However, among these people, once they have decided to pay, the 

premium they are willing to pay increases as beef is perceived safer. 

 

6. Concluding remarks  

It is no surprise to find that consumer risk perception regarding food has a large  impact 

on food purchasing behaviour. Recent food scares related to beef have increased consumer 

concern on beef safety, which, ultimately, reduced beef consumption in Spain. Reinforced 

controls, monitoring and mandatory traceability have been implemented at all stages of the 

beef supply chain in order to certify consumers that labelled beef is safe. As shown in this 

paper, beef consumption recovered within two years of the main BSE incident. However, it is 

difficult to exclusively attribute this recovery to these controls; many other factors, such as 

other meat incidents seem to play a role. In any case, increasing controls and traceability have 

increased marginal production costs, which ultimately have been translated into higher retail 

prices, which consumers may or may not be willing to pay. The aim of this paper has been to 

investigate the relationship between risk perception and willingness to pay for certified beef 



 19 

and to discover what the main factors are that affect the different steps in the consumer 

decision process. 

The modelling strategy employed is based on a three level process, which accounts for 

endogenous relationships across the behavioural determinants (attitudes towards food safety, 

beef safety perception and willingness to pay) and the role played by different socio-

demographic characteristics which improve the performance of the model. A recursive 

structure has been specified assuming a causal chain along the three equations. Although this 

modelling approach is more complex than other alternatives, the nature of this kind of 

structural equation model explicitly allows for non- linear relationships among variables. This 

is a more adequate strategy since it takes into account the nature of the questions that 

traditionally are included in consumer surveys. 

There are several rather interesting results. First, we have found a significant interaction 

between confidence in food safety, risk perception for beef and willingness to pay. Consistent  

with other results found in the literature, confidence in food safety negatively affects the 

perceived risk associated with beef. Education and trust in information sources seem to be a 

key variable in explaining confidence in food safety. Education may enhance the positive 

effect of trust in information provided by public authorities and weaken the negative effect of 

trust in information provided by mass media, which normally contributes to amplify the 

negative perception of food safety. 

A second interesting result, at least for the meat industry, is that the perceived risk 

associated with beef is mainly determined by the overall confidence in food safety and by 

personal experience. Since the consumer confidence in the safety of food is fairly high, and 

has not changed over time (de Jonge et al., 2004), it seems that food safety is assumed by 

consumers in the absence of food safety incident s (or, at least, that consumers are aware of). 



 20 

On the other hand, more experienced consumers seem to be more confident of beef safety as it 

is more likely that they have explored different information sources.  

Although consumers are increasingly concerned about beef safety, it seems consumers 

place little value on the indication of traceability per se. In fact, only one out of four 

respondents says they are willing to pay a premium, where risk perception and income are the 

most important determinants. In other words, traceability alone plays a very small role in 

consumer choices. As mentioned above, beef safety is considered a given by Spanish 

consumers and, thus, they do not understand why they have to pay a premium for it. Products 

labelled with a PDO linked to a particular region with a reputation for food safety or food 

quality may be able to garner premiums. But, further research is needed to assess the potential 

benefits (and costs) of alternative extrinsic cues like PDOs that are intended to improve the 

quality and safety attributes.  

Although our modelling strategy has been able to provide new insights into the 

relationship between risk perception and purchase intentions, there are some limitations to 

this research that could provide scope for future work. First, we need more theoretical 

research exploring how to integrate risk perception, trust and intention to purchase. 

Specifically, it would be very useful to discover how important the particular source of 

information is as well as the information content on risk perception. Second, it would be 

useful to generalize our results for food products other than beef and to apply it to other time 

spans, since interest in the issue of risk perception is evolving very rapidly with continuous 

improvements from public authorities and the private sector.
