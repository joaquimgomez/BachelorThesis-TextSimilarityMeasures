Advertisement Impact on Consumers Preferences:  
A Choice Experiment approach 

Abstract 

Our paper seeks to assess the impact of information and advertisement on 
consumers’ preference for wines in special occasions (Christmas) in Catalonia (Spain). 
We apply the Choice Experiments method to study the relative importance of attributes 
that describe consumers’ decision to purchase wine by using the Heteroskedastic 
Extreme Value (HEV) model. Data were obtained from two questionnaires applied to a 
pre and post spot samples formed by 299 and 400 individuals respectively. Results 
suggest that the proposed spot does not affect the ranking of the preferred attributes, 
nevertheless this preference is heterogeneous. After advertising preferences scores 
have revealed significant differences. The relative importance of the “Catalan” wine has 
increased compared to the “Spanish” wine. The most preferred product is a Catalan 
wine made from the “Cabernet Sauvignon” variety. Wines that have been previously 
tasted by the consumer seem to be preferred over recommended or prestigious wines. 
However, advertising increases the relative importance of prestigious wines.

1. Introduction 

Wine is a difficult and confusing product for consumers to choose (Lockshin et al., 
2006). This difficulty lies on the immense number of cues that hang from wine in 
comparison with many other products. To start with, wine differentiates by type: red, 
white, rosé, sparkling, liquored or others. Within each category, the amount of cues is 
yet very large, ranging from the country of origin - and for European wines also the 
Designations of Origin -, to the brand name, price, its awards or its packaging and 
labels. Intrinsic cues are also relevant in the wine market, such as quality and taste, 
vintage, grape variety – or varieties –, and/or alcohol content. As a consequence, the 
large range of wines available in the market makes consumer choices more complex 
than the choice of many other food products. Such complexity generates some 
difficulties when trying to determine the key factors that intervene in the consumer’s 
decision making. 

Price is a commonly used attribute to infer the quality of a product. Generally it will 
perform as a proxy when the product cannot be evaluated or when the perceived risk of 
making a wrong choice is high (Lockshin and Hall, 2003; Spawton, 1991; Mitchell and 
Greatorex, 1988; 1989; Zeithaml, 1988). The risk or the quality required for the 
consumer, nevertheless, changes depending on the consumption occasion (Quester 
and Smart 1998; Lockshin and Hall 2003). Therefore, consumers’ willingness to pay 
will vary with the occasion.  Hall and Lockshin (2000) determined that high price was 
important when a consumer was purchasing wine in order to impress a business 
associate or to celebrate a special anniversary. Low price was important, when the 
situation was to relax at home by oneself, or for entertaining at an informal party or 
BBQ. 

Brand name is also used to diminish the risk or as a proxy of the quality, even 
considered as the key unit of decision (Ehrenberg, 1988, in Lockshin and Hall, 2003).  
Consumers’ minds in our super-communicated societies reject to store the information 
that they are not able to assimilate (Ries and Trout, 1981). Therefore, the amount of 
information that consumers use to make a decision is small (Foxall 1983, Olshavsky 
and Granbois, 1979, Lockshin and Hall, 2003). Consumers are shown to develop a 
small brand repertoire, which may well be a collection of true brands and generic types 
(Lockshin and Hall, 2003; Gluckman, 1990). This generic type might build itself based 
on the region of origin and/or grape variety.  

The origin of the wine plays also a key role in the consumers’ decision making 
process (Keown and Casey 1995; Gluckman 1990; Skuras and Vakrou 2002).  In 
addition, the designation of origin is also determining (Angulo; et al., 2000; Gil and 
Sanchez, 1997; Quester and Smart, 1998; Rasmussen and Lockshin, 1999), although 
its importance depends on the country of study (Lockshin et al. 2006 and Goodman et 
al. 2007). In Spain, Angulo et al. (2000) claimed that the region and the vintage are the 
main determinants of wine prices. Other studies (Mtimet and Albisu, 2007; Sánchez 
and Gil, 1997; Gil and Sánchez, 1997) have also shown the relevance of the region of 
origin, although none of these where located in Catalonia. 

Spain is the third wine producing country in the world, after France and Italy. In 2006 
Spain produced more than 38 million hectolitres of wine (OIV, 2006). The wine sector 
in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and 
food industry. Its relevance lies on its contribution to the economy as well as on the 
social identity and on the landscapes that it confers. In Catalonia there are 12 
Designations of Origin (DO), including the DO Cava1. They represent more than 90% 
of the grape growing surface in Catalonia (IDESCAT, 2007), which means that wine 

                                                
1 The DO Cava exclusively produces Cava, which is a quality sparkling wine produced by the Traditional 
method (sometimes referred as Champenoise method, although that terminology was outlawed in Europe 
in 1994).

production is specialised in quality wine or, in its European terminology, Quality Wines 
Produced in Specified Regions (QWPSR). 

Wine household consumption in Catalonia has diminished from 21.1 litres per capita 
in 1999 to 13.2 in 2009 (MARM, 2010). Nevertheless, for the same period, quality wine 
consumption has risen 14.2%. Thus, the consumer seems to be experiencing a change 
of habits, diminishing the frequencies of wine consumption, but demanding higher 
quality wines. Along with the previous data, the market share of Catalan DO wines in 
retailer channels and in the HORECA2 sector in Catalonia is low, concentrating all 
together the 27.1% in the rolling year ended in September 2007 (INCAVI, 2007).  

Under this environment, the local wine authority of Catalonia (INCAVI, Catalan 
Institute of Wine and Vineyard) has approved a strategic plan to highlight the “origin” 
attribute of the Catalan wine as a relevant factor for consumers’ decisions. Thus, in 
Christmas 2007 an advertising campaign for local wines was launched. The campaign 
took place before and during Christmas holidays to stimulate local wine consumption in 
those dates, as well as to improve Catalan wine notoriety and fidelity amongst local 
consumers. It consisted of a television advertisement and the exhibition of posters 
placed on the urban city buses of Barcelona3. 

In this paper we compare wine stated preferences of 699 Catalan wine consumers, 
by means of a discrete Choice Experiments (CE), before and after the above 
mentioned campaign. Our main goal is to determine consumers’ preferences towards 
wine consumed in a special occasion as well as to find out whether they have been 
modified after the advertising campaign. In particular, we will focus our interest in those 
preferences regarding the origin attribute of the wine. 

The paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we discuss the methodological 
framework. The empirical application is commented in section 3. The main results are 
discussed in Section 4 and the paper ends with some concluding remarks.  

2. Methods 
2.1. The Choice experiments 

The CE belongs to the stated preference type of methods and is based on the 
creation of a hypothetical market for the analyzed goods and services. Individuals are 
asked which product they would buy from a set of competitive products at different 
prices. The application of the CE implies the presentation to “subjects” of an array of 
“choice sets” representing different possible states of the good of interest. Subjects are 
asked to choose the “alternative” that they consider the best within each choice set. An 
example of a choice set for wine alternatives can be seen in Figure 1. 

In the construction of the choice sets, researchers usually face two approaches: a) 
in the first one, respondents are given the possibility to choose neither of the products 
offered in the choice sets, allowing for a non-forced choice task. In this case a new 
alternative is included in the choice set known as “no-election”, “no-option” or “opt-out” 
alternative that allow respondents not choose any of the products. As this alternative is 
constant among all offered choice sets it is also identified in CE literature as “fixed 
alternative”. b) The second approach relies on excluding from the choice sets the 
abovementioned alternative imposing consumers to select their preferred product in a 
forced choice task. 

The issue of including or excluding the “opt-out” alternative in choice experiments 
has been addressed by several studies highlighting among others Dhar (1997); Dhar 
and Simonson (2003) and Haaijer, et al. (2001). The decision to include or not a forced 
option depends on the objective of the study (Dhar, 1997; Dhar and Simonson, 2003; 
Bech and Gyrd-Hansen, 2005; Carlsson et al., 2007). While, the non-forced choice

increases the realism of the hypothetical simulated market (Batsell and Louviere, 1991; 
Carson et al., 1994), the forced choice can be a valid option when: a) the interest of the 
study is to compare levels and attributes or alternatives (Carlsson et al., 2007), b) the 
procrastination of the choice is damaging, i.e. the cost of delay is high or the product is 
needed (Dhar and Simonson, 2003) and c) to avoid potential “greater easy way out” 
(Blamey and Bennett, 2001). Further details of this methodology can be found in 
Hensher, Rose and Greene (2005), Bennett and Blamey (2001), Louviere, Hensher 
and Swait (2000) and Adamowicz, Louviere and Swait (1998) among others.

In our study we have principally used the forced choice approach due to the three 

reasons found out from the literature, as previously mentioned. First, as we try to 
analyze the position of the “origin” attributes compared to the other descriptors, as well 
the relevance of the advertisement campaign on the magnitude of this attribute, our 
interest of study falls under the category of comparing levels and attributes or 
alternatives (Carlsson et al., 2007). Second, we suppose that the procrastination of the 
choice is damaging, since the timing of the experiment is Christmas and consumers 
are “forced” to buy wine for celebrations. Thus the cost of delay is high since the 
product is needed (Dhar and Simonson, 2003). Third, since our objective is to compare 
the pre and post experiment results, we need to control the potential “greater easy way 
out” obtained from the no-choice option (Blamey and Bennett, 2001). In this context, 
we hypothesize, that consumers in the post experiment (after Christmas) are more 
likely to choose the non-choice option as the interest of celebration has passed. 

In choice experiments, subjects choose among alternatives from a choice set 
according to a utility function with two components: a systematic (observable) 
component and a random term (non-observable) as follows: 

( , )in in i n inU V X S ε= +         [1] 

where inU  is the utility provided by alternative i to subject n, inV  is the systematic 
component of the utility, iX  is the vector of attributes of alternative i, nS  is the vector of 
socio-economic characteristics of the respondent n, and inε  is the random term. 

Due to the presence of the random component in the utility function, the researcher 
will never be able to perfectly predict the subjects’ preferences. As a consequence, we 



6 

deal with a stochastic problem that can be solved by defining the “probability of 
election”. Thus, the probability that an individual n chooses the alternative i rather than 
the alternative j (for any i and j belonging to the space of alternatives considered, Cn), is 
equivalent to the probability that Ui is greater than Uj. This condition is given by: 

Pr(i|Cn) = Pr[Uin > Ujn] = Pr (Vin + εin > Vjn + εjn) ∀j ∈Cn\{j}  [2] 

Which is equivalent to: Pr(i|Cn) = Pr [(Vin - Vjn) > (εjn - εin)] ∀j ∈Cn\{j} [3] 
According to this equation, since the random components are not observable, it is 

enough that analysts estimate the probability that (Vin - Vjn) is greater than (εjn - εin). 

 

2.2. The Econometric model 

Among the probabilistic choice models, the Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) is one of 
the most employed models for dealing with CE-sampled data (Adamowicz, Louviere 
and Swait, 1998). Several assumptions underlie the formulation of this model. One of 
the most important is that the random components of the utilities of the different 
alternatives are independent and identically distributed (IID) with a type I extreme-value 
(or Gumbel) distribution. Such a distribution in the error term allows for the verification 
of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property, known as Luce’s axiom 
(Luce, 1959), which implies that the ratio of the probabilities of choosing any pair of 
alternatives i and j [Pr(i/Cn)/Pr(j/Cn)] is not dependent on the systematic utility of any 
other alternative within the set of alternatives Cn. The assumption of independence 
implies that there are no common unobserved factors affecting the utilities of the 
various alternatives. The assumption of identically distributed (across alternatives) 
random utility terms implies that the extent of variation in unobserved factors affecting 
utility is the same across all alternatives. Another important assumption is that the error 
variance-covariance structure of the alternatives is identical across individuals (Bhat, 
1995). 

To overcome the assumptions mentioned above, different models for discrete 
choice experiments have been defined. From those, we have used in this study the 
Heteroskedastic models that relax the identically distributed (across alternatives) error 
term assumption. Out of this class of models, we will use the so-called 
“Heteroskedastic Extreme Value” (HEV) model which allows for a non-identical random 
components distribution (Bhat, 1995 and 2000). The HEV model assumes that the 
alternative error terms are distributed with a type I extreme value distribution and the 
variances of the alternative error terms are allowed to be different across all 
alternatives. Such circumstances are used to normalize the error terms of one of the 
alternatives by having a scale parameter of one for identification. In other words, the 
HEV model relaxes the restrictive IIA (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives) property 
of the MNL model by allowing different scale parameters across alternatives. This 
model has been used in various application: a) at methodological level as a tool for the 
appropriate selection of tree structures in hierarchical choice models (Hensher, 1999), 
b) in the environmental studies, to analyse individual environmental consciousness for 
transport mode choices (Shen et al., 2008), c) in transport choice analysis to identify 
intercity mode choice (Bhat, 1995) and d) in food consumers’ preferences to analyse 
the effect of in-store displays and advertising on tuna purchase (Allenby and Ginter, 
1995) and to asses consumer choice for goods branded package (Baltas, 1998). In 
addition, the HEV model has been used to measure the economic value of cultural 
heritage (Mazzanti, 2003).  

For the HEV model, the probability that an individual n will choose alternative i is 
similar to the MNL (McFadden, 1974) with the exception that the scalar parameter µ is 
different across alternatives (µi). This scale parameter represents uncertainty 
associated with the expected utility (the observed part of utility) of an alternative. 
Therefore, the lower is the scale parameter; the higher is the uncertainty (Louviere et 
al., 2000). In this case, the probability is formulated as:

∑

where Vin is the systematic component of the utility provided by alternative i which is 
given by the following expression: 

in k k in

V Xβ= ∑         [5] 
where: 
i = 1…I, representing the selected alternative i within the set of alternatives (Cn); 
k = 1…K, representing the attributes which characterize alternative i; 
βk = model parameter of attribute k; 
Xki = value of attribute k in alternative i; 

 
Once parameters are estimated, they represent the marginal utility of attributes and 

its contribution to the total utility function. Thus Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) 
between attributes can be obtained. In this context, as one of the attributes is 
expressed in monetary term (i.e. the price), it is possible to determine its “implicit price” 
(IP) or part-worth as follows:

3. Empirical application 

Data used in this analysis was obtained from two face-to-face questionnaires that 
collect: a) extensive information on socio-economic characteristics of consumers, b) 
their attitudes and opinions towards wine consumption, c) their perceptions towards 
quality wines, d) their knowledge about wines with Designation of Origin (spontaneous 
notoriety, fame and fidelity), e) their attribute preferences for Catalan wines and 
purchasing intentions and f) consumers’ willingness to pay for wine’s attributes and to 
analyze possible changes in preferences after the advertising campaign. The surveys 
have been conducted in two stages: before and after the Christmas campaign (pre and 
post experiment) with 299 and 400 consumers respectively. Participants were qualified 
by having purchased a bottle of wine in the last 3 months. The purchase was defined 
for a red quality wine for home consumption during Christmas. This was done in order 
to avoid possible consumers’ misspecifications, such as respondents thinking of 
different specific occasions or different wine products, which could result in biased 
responses. Moreover, we aimed at testing the effect of the promotional campaign 
during Christmas.  

Both questionnaires were identical with the exception that the second one contained 
multimedia information (videos and graphical documents of the advertisement 
campaign) presented to consumers in the post experiment to recall them the launched 
campaign on television. Figure 2 summarizes our experiment stages. 

In both cases, a stratified sampling method by age and postal districts using 
proportional percentage to the number of persons by stratum was used. The population 
represents consumers over 18 years who regularly purchase food and beverages and 
are residents in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Table 1 shows a summary of the 
technical sheet of the survey.

A key element in choice experiments is the experimental design. Following the 
approach mentioned above, the first step has been the determination of main attributes 
and levels that consumers take into account when purchasing wine for a special 
occasion such as Christmas. To tackle this issue we used results from previous 
literature. The identified attributes were subsequently discussed in a focus group 
involving university lecturers in the field of marketing as well as representatives from 
consumer associations in Catalonia. The attributes finally included in our experiment 
were endorsed by all participants. 

The discussion showed that the “origin” of the wine is the most relevant attribute to 
determine if the advertising campaign promoting local wine could modify consumer’s 
preferences. Because of the generality of the campaign we chose “Catalan wine”, as 
an attribute level, instead of a specific Catalan DO. In the same way, Spanish wines 
were generalized as “Spanish wine” – understanding by this any wine produced in 
Spain except those produced in Catalonia –. The third level chosen was “Foreign 
wine”. The grape variety can also be considered as a generic brand. In the New World 
it is a major factor in wine choice (Lockshin and Hall, 2003). For Spain we have found 
mixed results.  Angulo et al. (2000) found that it was not important to determine wine 
prices of red quality wine, while Mtimet and Albisu (2007) in his choice experiment 
found out that consumers chose rather for the only possible French variety that was 
presented (Cabernet Sauvignon). In our experiment we added two French varieties, 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and a typical traditional Spanish variety, which is 
Grenache. By including a second French variety we aim to determine if the preference 
is for French varieties in general, or specific for the Cabernet Sauvignon grape.

Other attributes that could have been included were the vintage, the wine awards, 
the alcohol content and the labeling and packaging. Due to obvious reasons we had to 
limit the amount of attributes but, notwithstanding, the validity of the information that 
could have obtained using some of these attributes might have not been relevant. In 
the case of the vintage, the older the wine the more likely consumers will choose it. 
This result has been previously obtained for the Spanish consumer (Angulo et al. 2000; 
Mtimet and Albisu, 2007) and, in any case, is known as part of the popular wine 
culture. The attributes related to the possible awards or the wine alcohol content were 
tested beforehand in a pilot test and found not to be so relevant for the consumer. 
Besides, according to Angulo et al. (2000), alcoholic content is not an important 
determinant of red quality wine price. Another cue that turned out to be not relevant in 
our pilot test was the packaging. By packaging we refer to the bottle and label 
characteristics. Previous research (Mueller and Szolnoki, 2010) has found that these 
attributes are relevant only if they are visible in the experiment, but not recorded if they 
are not mentioned or explicitly included. 

The last attribute included in our experiment was the knowledge of the wine that 
consumers have in the pre-purchase stage. The levels included were: (1) previous 
knowledge of the wine, when consumers have previously tasted the wine; (2) 
recommended wine and, (3) prestigious wine. According to Thach (2008), consumers 
use prior tasting experience and recommendations as their main selection cues when 
buying wine in retail stores. By the third level we try to ascertain the effect of a known 
brand name (prestigious) in front of the other two alternatives. Thus, the final set of 
attributes was: origin, knowledge, variety and price. A pilot questionnaire was 
implemented to check for consistency. The final attributes and levels are shown in 
Table 2.

Following a full factorial design, a total of 81 hypothetical products can be generated 
by combining the above mentioned attribute levels generating a potential 34x34 (6,561) 
possible combinations or choice sets. To make the analysis more affordable we have 
carried out an orthogonal fractional factorial design considering only all attributes’ main 
effects. This decision was based on the evidence that main effects explained 90% of 
the variance of the choice model. Interaction effects explained only the remaining 
variance, which is usually considered as irrelevant (Dawes and Corrigan, 1974). The 
above design enables us to reduce the number of choice sets from the initial 6,561, in 
the full design, to nine choice sets only. Figure 1 shows one of these sets.

3.1. Preferences Heterogeneity of wine consumers 
 

To cope with preference heterogeneity, we include the relationship between the 
valuations of attributes and respondents’ socio-demographic and behavioral variables. 
This relation should be introduced into the utility function interacting attributes and 
respondent characteristics, since these variables remain constant among the different 
choice sets that face each respondent. The utility specification for the heterogeneity 
preference analysis is: 

( )in k ki k p k i pn
k k p

V X X Sβ α= + ×∑ ∑∑        [7] 
where 
p = 1…P, represents the socio-economic and behavioral characteristics of individual n; 
αkp = coefficient of interaction between the attribute k and the socio-economic 
characteristic p; 
Xki × Spn = combined effect of attribute k in alternative i (Xki) by socio-economic 
characteristic p of individual n (Spn). 

 
A model for each social, economic and behavioral variable was built introducing 

interaction for each variable with all attributes levels as follow:

The social and economic variables included in the analysis are: gender (GEN), age 
(AGE), household social class (SC) and place of birth (PRT). Some of the behavioral 
variables are related to wine involvement such as wine purchase frequency (FRQ) and 
reading the information about wine published on the press (INF), and others related to 
individual attitude towards Catalan wines. To measure consumers’ attitudes we 
considered consumers’ valuations on the following aspects: (1) Catalan wines have 
good flavor, texture and palate (FLAV), (2) Catalan wines possess well-known brands 
and have public prestige (PRST) and, (3) Catalan wines are reasonably priced (REAS) 
(see Annex 1 for the codification details). 

As an example, the specification of utility function for the gender variable (GEN) 
takes the following form:

4. Results 

 

In order to characterize consumers in both experiments, Table 3 represents a 
summary of the most important socio-demographic variables. It is important to mention 
that in both samples the proportion of each stratum is in accordance with the Catalan 
population. As can be seen there are no significant differences between both samples.

Other variables related to wine consumption, behavior and knowledge are shown in 
Table 4. Results show no significant differences between the samples from the pre- 
and the post- experiment. Wine consumers from the metropolitan area of Barcelona 
purchase wine mainly several times a month. Nevertheless, a weekly purchase 
frequency also obtained a high percentage. Catalan consumers’ concept of 
designations of origin relates mostly to the origin of the wine and the grapes, as well as 
to its quality. Their behavior towards wine, specifically their behavior in order to collect 
information about wine, is not elaborated. Most of the consumers only read the 
information printed on the label.

Results from the HEV model are shown in Table 5. Overall, the model is highly 

significant and the goodness of fit is acceptable. Results show that in both models (pre 
and post experiment) all parameters (variables coefficients and scale parameters) are 
statistically significant with the exception of the level “Recommended”, indicating that 
almost all attributes and levels considered are significant determinants of consumer’s 
welfare. The positive (negative) sign of the parameters indicates a positive (negative) 
contribution to utility.

Scale parameters are significantly different from 1.0 at 1% showing variance 

variability among alternatives. In addition, it implies that the assumption of 
independently and identically distributed (IIID) across alternatives is violated, 
confirming that the specified model in this study is appropriate. 

For the purposed economic interpretation of parameters the implicit prices (IP) are 
calculated for each attribute as well as their confidence intervals using the Krinsky and 
Robb (1986) procedure.  Coefficients of the reference level 0( )β  are calculated as 

1 2( 1) ( 1)β β× − + × − following the effect coding procedure. Almost all implicit prices in 
Table 6 are statistically different from zero with the exception of “recommended” in pre 
and post advertising. Moreover, comparing pre and post results, the analyzed spot has 
demonstrated a null impact on attributes ranking between the two samples. Thus, for 
the origin attribute, consumers prefer the Catalan origin followed by the Spanish and 
Foreign wines. For Knowledge, consumers assign higher utility to previous own 
experience as the best source of information when purchasing wine for a special 
occasion, followed by “recommendation” and “overall prestige”. Finally, regarding to 
varieties, the most preferred is the Cabernet Sauvignon followed by the Grenache and 
Merlot.

Note: IP are measured in €, which is the willingness to pay for each of the attributes and

Analyzing the magnitude of differences between IP, results show the presence of 

highly significant differences between the pre and post experiment. In the post 
experiment, all values are lower. Thus, there is a general decrease of the willingness to 
pay for all attributes after the advertising in absolute values. This fact has to do with the 
time when the post experiment was carried out (January). This month is conditioned by 
two issues. First, households must accommodate from the high expenditure related to 
Christmas. Second, the winter sales start. As a consequence, consumers’ overall WTP 
for food and beverage is low. Thus, results have to be interpreted in relative terms (the 
percentage change of IP between levels within the pre and post advertising campaign, 
respectively). This allows us to analyze the relative change of valuation between levels 
independent from the obtained value of the willingness to pay. Results are shown in 
Table 7.

As is shown in Table 7, consumers’ valuation for the Catalan origin of wine 
compared to the Spanish origin is relatively more important in the post experiment. 
Results show a 81.31% premium between the Catalan and the Spanish wine in the 
post treatment, when it was 52.07% in the pre advertising period. This is especially 
relevant due to the competitive positioning of Spanish wines in Catalonia, particularly 
those from La Rioja. Taking this result into account we can conclude that the promotion 
campaign has succeeded in increasing the positive image of Catalan wines amongst 
the local population. 



15 

Regarding knowledge, we highlight the relative importance of the overall prestige of 
the wine in the post advertising experiment compared to previous experience and 
recommendation. The relative difference between recommended wine and prestige has 
decreased from 313.05%, in the pre test, to -268.14%. Finally, no significant changes 
have been detected in relation to grape varieties. 

4.1. Heterogeneity analysis results 

In order to evaluate the heterogeneity of wine consumers’ preferences we estimate 
a specific HEV models for each social, economic and behavioral variables mentioned 
in the empirical application. All obtained models are significant and show a good fit with 
highly significant likelihood ratios4. In almost all analyzed variables, the most preferred 
attributes for red wine in Catalonia is the Catalan origin from the Cabernet Sauvignon 
grape. In addition, wines that have been previously tasted and experienced by the 
consumer seem to be preferred over recommended or prestigious wines. 

For the economic interpretation of the models obtained, the IP have been calculated 
following Expression (10). Tables (9a, 9b, 9c) show the average IP obtained from the 
pre and post advertisement for the analyzed variables. It is important to be aware that 
estimating the HEV models for each social, economic and behavioral variable 
separately ignores the ceteris paribus condition. Therefore, the conclusions drawn for 
each variable should be treated with caution. However, this is an unavoidable limitation 
due to the loss of degrees of freedom that an analysis integrating all kind of interactions 
would require. 

As can be shown in Tables (9a, 9b, 9c), results show that the preferences for red 
wine for a special occasion as Christmas are highly heterogeneous. Nevertheless, 
results from pre and post advertisement show a general trend toward the most 
preferred attributes and levels. In this context, the main trends are highlighted stressing 
the principal differences found amongst analyzed segments. Differences found 
amongst specific segments and the whole sample results are also pointed out. For a 
better understanding of heterogeneity results, readers are recommended to keep in 
mind the results obtained of the whole respondents on average (Table 6). Following we 
will comment the results focusing in each, economic, demographic and behavioral 
variable: 

 
a) Gender 
 As can be seen, male show more consistent results than Female. Male results 

indicate a clear preference for the Catalan origin and the Cabernet sauvignon 
grape. On the contrary, Female preferences do not show such a clear pattern, 
which indicates a greater dispersion of preferences amongst them. 
 

b) Age 
 Consumers’ preferences for Catalan origin and for the Cabernet Sauvignon variety 

increase with age. The former can be explained as the national feelings are more 
pronounced with ages in Catalonia, while the latter is because the Sauvignon 
variety is one of the world’s best varieties highly rich in polyphenols5.  

 The youngest segment shows the highest IP for a previously experienced wine. 
This can be explained due to their higher uncertainty when purchasing wine. A 
previously experienced wine grants the consumer with the certainty that their 

                                                
4 Results of the individual HEV models for the other variables included in the utility specification, [i.e. age 
(AGE), household social class (SC), place of birth (PB), wine purchase frequency (FRQ), reading the 
information about wine (INF), Catalan wines have good flavor, texture and palate (FLAV), Catalan wines 
have well-known brands and prestige (PRST) and Catalan wines are reasonably priced (REAS) were not 
included to avoid overwhelming the reader and due to space restriction. However, these results are 
available for interested readers under request.

election will be likable. Therefore, younger and more inexperienced people tend to 
choose a product that they know, in order to diminish risk uncertainty in their 
purchase decisions. In this respect, we would recommend wine fairs addressed to 
youngsters in order to increase their wine knowledge and, thus, feel less insecure 
in their wine purchases. 
 

c) Social class 
 Low social class tends to show the lowest IPs compared to the other classes. 

These results are in general in accordance to the theory showing that consumers 
are less willing to pay as their budgets decrease. 

 Middle class is the only segment that shows significant positive IP for the Spanish 
wines. We hypothesized that this segment could be related to having his place of 
birth outside Catalonia and therefore, they would prefer the Spanish rather than 
any other wine. However, non-significant results were found. 

 For the grape variety attribute, the lower class, unlike the other classes, do not 
show a negative significant IP for Grenache. This could be explained taking into 
account that this variety is the cheapest one compared to the other varieties. 

d) Place of birth 
 Catalan natives show the highest IP for the origin attribute, followed by Spanish 

and foreign natives. In the same way, Catalan natives also show the highest IP for 
grape variety, while foreign natives show the lowest. This behavior is repeated for 
the knowledge attribute. Therefore, people born out of Spain show less interest for 
the product. We could think that this is because the nonexistence of wine culture in 
their countries of origin, or they could have other priorities and interest for their 
income expenditure. 

 Spanish natives show a higher preference for Spanish wines as expected, 
although this only occurs in the pre advertisement sample. 
 

e) Wine purchase frequency 
 For grape variety, both low and high frequency buyers show higher preference for 

the most popular grape (Cabernet Sauvignon). However, high frequency buyers 
are indifferent towards Grenache and Merlot, in comparison to the rest. For the 
knowledge attribute, high frequency buyers show lower IP. Compared to the whole 
sample, the experienced wine is not significant for them. This segment reveals 
lower uncertainty when purchasing wine due to greater information, together with a 
more open attitude for new experiences. 
 

f) Reading information about wine in the press  
 Also related to wine involvement, the segment that reads the information shows a 

higher IP for the origin attribute. They are more willing to pay for a Catalan origin of 
the wine. For the other analyzed attributes, those that do not read the information 
in the press follow the results of the whole sample, while those that read it do not. 
For the grape variety they show non-significant results for Merlot, while for the 
knowledge attribute it is not clear if they rather a previously experienced wine or a 
recommended one. Moreover, prestigious wines are not relevant for them (nor 
negative nor positively influencing). Their results, thus, manifest a stronger 
influence by wine articles and advertisement as a consequence of their reading. 
 

g) Attitudes towards Catalan wines [(1) Catalan wines have good flavor, texture 
and palate; (2) Catalan wines are well known and have public prestige, and (3) 
Catalan wines are reasonably priced]  

 Those who agree with the proposed statements reveal higher IP’s for Catalan 
wines. On the contrary, those who disagree show higher IP’s when the origin is 
Spain. A previously tasted wine tends to be the preferred level in general, but 
especially for those who disagree with the statements proposed.

5. Discussion 

Our study has used the Discrete Choice Experiments method using a 
Heteroskedastic Extreme Value (HEV) to assess the impact of information and 
advertising on consumers’ preferences for wine in Catalonia (Spain) as well as to 
analyze the position of several wine attributes, especially the origin of the wine. 

In Catalonia local wines compete strongly with wines produced in the rest of Spain. 
Thus, in the analyzed Christmas occasion an advertising campaign was designed to 
stimulate local wine consumption in that period, as well as to improve Catalan wine 
notoriety and fidelity amongst local consumers. The data used in this analysis were 
obtained from two face to face questionnaires before and after the Christmas campaign 
with 299 and 400 consumers, respectively.  

Results suggest that the proposed spot does not affect the ranking of the preferred 
attributes. However this preference is highly heterogeneous and it depends on social, 
demographic and behavioral variables. The most preferred product is a Catalan wine 
made from the “Cabernet Sauvignon” variety and previously tasted by the consumer. 
However, the magnitude of the marginal utilities has revealed significant differences. 
After the advertising, the relative importance of the “Catalan” level has increased 
compared to the Spanish one. This is especially relevant due to the competitive 
positioning of Spanish wines in Catalonia, particularly those from La Rioja. Thus we 
can conclude that advertising is a key factor to increase consumer awareness for local 
wines. 

As previously found out by Mtimet and Albisu (2007), Spanish consumers seem to 
prefer the French variety Cabernet Sauvignon over other Spanish varieties. In our 
study, we have included a second French variety to examine if the preference is for 
French varieties in general, or specific for the Cabernet Sauvignon grape. Our results 
show that the preference is specific for this variety, as the Merlot variety generated a 
negative utility for the consumer. 

Our results also show consumer’s preference towards a previously tasted wine (own 
experience) over a prestigious or recommended one. The consumer may be open to 
try different wines but, when buying, a previously tasted one will prevail to diminish his 
uncertainty. This shows the paramount importance of wine fairs and public tastings as 
a marketing strategy to let local wines be known by the consumer. Results suggest that 
instead of big promotion campaigns focused in special consumption occasions, smaller 
pieces of information along the year could be more effective in increasing consumer 
knowledge towards Catalan wines and promote initial tasting. As previous experience 
is a key factor in wine consumer behavior, these campaigns could generate increasing 
fidelity towards Catalan wines. It is worth mentioning that the difference-in-differences 
(DID) approach is an interesting technique to assess the effect of advertisement on 
consumers’ preferences. A comparison of results obtained from CE and this alternative 
remains for future research.
