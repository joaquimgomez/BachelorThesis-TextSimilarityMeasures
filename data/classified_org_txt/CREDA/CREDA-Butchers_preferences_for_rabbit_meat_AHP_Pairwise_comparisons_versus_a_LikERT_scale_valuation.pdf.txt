ABSTRACT 
 

 
Our paper analyzes butchers preferences toward the attributes and levels for fresh rabbit meat. We 
compare results obtained from alternatives approaches of data collection: a) the traditional pair wise 
comparison of AHP (AHP1) and b) the direct valuation by mean of a 9 point likert scale transformed 
in a a subsequent step to estimate AHP (AHP2). The data used in this analysis was obtained from face-
to-face questionnaires with butchers carried out during May-April 2010. The final sample consists of 
50 butchers mainly located in Barcelona. Results obtained from the two approaches of data collection 
show similar rank of the preferred attributes and levels. However, the obtained weights from both 
approaches are not totally similar. 
 
Keywords: AHP, likert scale, butchers preferences 
 
1. Introduction 
The AHP is a multi-criteria decision-supporting method that aims to decompose a complex decision 
problem in a hierarchy of smaller constituent sub-problems. In this context, consumers’ decision 
toward products preference can be decomposed. AHP allow obtaining weights (w) for each attribute 
and level of a product in order to explain individual behavior in choosing their preferred one. The 
relative importance or weight (w) for attribute (An) and level (Ln.p), where; n (1, ..., N) is the number of 
attributes and p (=1, ..., P) is the number of levels, are obtained from a N×(N-1)/2 pairwise 
comparisons (in the case of attributes) and P×(P-1)/2 (in the case of levels). 
 
In this context of preference analysis, Likert (1932) developed the principle of measuring attitudes 
and preferences by asking people to respond to a series of statements about a topic, in terms of: 
agreement (From strongly Agree to strongly disagree), frequency (Always to never), importance 
(Very important to unimportant), quality (poor to excellent), likelihood (almost always true to almost 
never true) and so tapping into the cognitive and affective components of attitudes. Often five ordered 
response levels are used; although the seven or the nine levels are also applied. The Likert Scale is an 
ordered, one-dimensional scale from which respondents choose one option that best aligns with their 
view. Thus, using the likert as a scale in terms of importance allows obtaining the stated preference of 
attributes and levels of a product as in the case of the AHP. 
 
Our paper seeks to compare results obtained from the abovementioned alternatives approaches of data 
collection: a) the traditional pairwise comparison of AHP (AHP1) and b) a 9 point likert scale 
valuation collected in term of importance. To make a coherent comparison, we propose a 
transformation approach of the likert scale to approximate the Saaty pairwise comparison allowing 
estimating another AHP (AHP2). The main advantage of the transformation of the likert scale 
valuation compared to the traditional pairwise comparison is the number of questions required to 
answers. While, in the latter the number needed is N×(N-1)/2 and P×(P-1)/2, in the former the

required number match up the number of product attributes (N) and levels (P), reducing drastically the 
number of comparisons and alleviating the answering process. The data used for comparing both 
method of data collection in this analysis was obtained from face-to-face questionnaires with 50 
butchers carried out during May-April 2010 to analyze their preferences for attributes and levels for 
fresh rabbit meat. Figure 1 shows a summary of the proposed methodological framework.

2. Methodology 
 
2.1. The AHP from pairwise comparison (AHP1) 
Determining the most preferred alternative from a set of products is a decision problem where the top 
level of the hierarchy represents the individual product. It is decomposed into a predefined number of 
characteristics (attributes) on the second level and their corresponding levels on the third level as can 
be seen in Figure 2 where An are the attributes and Ln.p are the levels. 
 

 
Figure 2: Hierarchical structure used to value product attributes and levels. 

 
In order to implement the AHP, one needs to carry out a survey where individuals are asked to make 
two types of pairwise comparisons: a) a pairwise comparison of the levels within each attribute (Ln.p); 
and b) a pairwise comparison of the attributes (An). First, the respondent has to indicate which of the 
two elements the respondent prefers. Then a nine-point scale is used to measure the strength of this 
preference by means of verbal judgments (Saaty, 1977; 1980). as shown in Table 1.

To estimate the relative importance or weight (w) for attribute (An) and level (Ln.p), From the answers 
provided, a matrix with the following structure is generated for each individual k (1, ... , K) and is 
known as a Saaty matrix.

where aijk represents the value obtained from the pairwise comparison between attribute/level i (iN / 
iP) and attribute/level j; (jN / jP) for each individual k. If perfect consistency in preferences hold 
for each decision-maker, it should also hold that aihk  ahjk = aijk for all i, j and h (hN / hP). This 
condition implies that values given for pairwise comparisons represent weights given to each 
objective by a perfectly rational decision-maker aijk= wik/wjk for all i and j. Under such circumstances, 
K weights (wNk) for each attribute and K weights (wPk) for each level can be easily determined from 
the N(N-1)/2 values and P(P-1)/2 values for aijk respectively. However, perfect consistency is seldom 
present in reality, where personal subjectivity plays an important role in the pairwise comparison.  
In Saaty matrices where some degree of inconsistency is present, alternative approaches have been 
proposed to estimate the weight vector that is better able to represent the decision-maker’s real weight 
vector. Saaty (1980; 2003) proposed two options as the accurate estimate of real weights: the 
geometric mean and the main eigenvector. Other authors have proposed alternatives based on 
regression analysis (Laininen and Hämäläinen, 2003) or goal programming (Bryson, 1995). As all 
criteria meet the requirements to estimate the above-mentioned weights, we choose the geometric 
mean (Aguarón and Moreno, 2000; Kallas, et al., 2007). Using this approach, weights assigned by 
subject to each attribute and level are obtained using the following expression:

2.2. The AHP from Likert scale comparisons (AHP2) 
Following the alternative approach of likert scale to collect data first we realize a direct valuation of 
attributes and levels using a nine-point likert scale; where “1” mean that the attribute is “not 
important” in the decision of buying the product and “9” mean it is “very important” as can be seen in 
Table 2. 

 
Table 2: direct valuation of attributes and level by likert scale 

Attributes and levels (1: Non important, 5: Indifferent    9: Very important) 

An 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

Ln.p 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
 

In a subsequent step, the result of each valuation score (Sc) obtained from the abovementioned likert 
scale is transformed to simulate a pairwise comparison as follow: 
Let suppose that the score value “Sc” for individual k obtained from the likert scale valuation for a 
product descriptors i (i.e. attributes or levels) is Scik and the score value for another descriptors j is 
Scjk. Both scores are measured on the same ordered, one-dimensional and continuous scale. Therefore, 
the difference between scores (Scik - Scjk) allow to approximate the difference of “relative importance” 
between the measured descriptors. As a result, scores difference can be transformed to simulate the 
judgment (aij) of the traditional AHP pairwise comparisons between descriptors i and j as follow: 

ˆ 1ij ik jka Sc Sc    
The estimated judgments by the transformation approach are used later to estimate the relative 
weights (w) of attribute (An) and level (Ln.p), following the usual AHP estimation procedure. For 
instance, if Scik of the descriptor i for individual k is 8 and the Scjk of the descriptor j for individual k is 



6, then the transformation approach of the paired comparisons between i and j is ˆ 1ij ik jka Sc Sc    
=  |6-8| +1= 3.  
3. Empirical application 
For the empirical application we evaluate the stated preferences of butchers for rabbit meat product in 
Barcelona. The data used in this analysis was obtained from face-to-face questionnaires with butchers 
carried out during May-April 2010. Each questionnaire solicits extensive information on their 
characteristics, attitudes and perceptions toward rabbit meat. The final sample consists of 50 butchers 
mainly located in Barcelona. To mitigate the order effect, we follow a design based on ordering 
change, both within and between the two approaches of data collection as advised by Charzan (1994). 
We split our sample into four sub-samples, generating four versions of the survey differentiated by 
different orders between the pairwise comparisons and likert scale. 

 

 
Figure 2: Followed design to mitigate order effect within and between methods 

 
In the empirical application the first step is to clearly define the main attributes that butchers take into 
consideration when purchasing rabbit meat. We first rely on prior research performed on rabbit meat 
preferences (Hoffman et al., 1992, Mclean-Meyinsse, 2000, Hoffman, et al., 2004, Kalio et al., 2008, 
Kallas et al., 2011) and a focus group comprised of university lecturers in the field of marketing. The 
final set of attributes included is: origin, format, brand and price (Table 3) 
 

Table 3: Attributes and levels rabbit meat preference for butchers 

Attributes Levels 
Origin (A1)  Catalan supplier (regional), Spanish supplier (national) and Foreign supplier (international). 
Brand (A3) Unbranded, Commercial brand and Quality brand 
Format (A2) Boneless rabbit meat, Pieced rabbit meat and Entire rabbit meat 
Price Generic attribute without levels. 

 
 
4. Results 
Results obtained from the two approaches of data collection (the traditional pairwise comparisons and 
the likert scale valuation and its posterior transformation) show similar rank of the preferred attributes 
and levels. In both methods the most important attribute is the price that has the highest weight, 
followed by the format, brand and origin. However, as can be seen in the constructed hierarchy in 
Figure 3, the obtained weights from both approaches are not totally similar. For instance, the weight 
of the price attribute from the AHP1 is 0.359 while it is 0.290 in the AHP2. Also for the origin, brand

and format attributes the obtained values are 0.102, 0.169 and 0.295 for the AHP1 and, 0.1555, 0.248 
and 0.273 for the AHP2 respectively).  
 
Analyzing the weights of levels within each attribute both methods report similar weights with small 
differences. All ranks of levels is similar for all the analyzed attributes. Thus within the origin 
attributes the preferred level is for Catalan, followed by Spain and Foreign origin of the meat. For the 
brand attribute, the most preferred level is for quality brand, commercial and unbranded product. 
Finally, the butchers prefer entire rabbit meat compared to the pieced and boneless. 

 
Figure 3: Results of the descriptors’ weights between AHP1 and AHP2 

 
Analyzing quantitatively the difference between weights from both approaches of data collection in 
valuating attributes and levels, results in Table 4 show the presence in some cases of statistically 
significant difference. However, the differences between weights from AHP1 and AHP2 are small and 
in general oscillate from 1% to 8%. However, in some cases the magnitude of the difference is 
statistically significant. With the exception of the format attribute all differences are significantly 
different. In addition, with the exception of the origin levels, value obtained from AHP1 for unbranded 
and Boneless levels are higher than those obtained from AHP2 (7.36% and 8.05% respectively). 
However, AHP1 shows low value of Commercial brand and Pieced levels compared to AHP1 (-4.48% 
and -4.85% respectively).

5. Conclusions 
 
Using the likert scale to estimate the relative importance of attributes and levels in the decision of 
individual to buy products can be a valid data collection approach. Our proposed approach to 
transform the scale score to a judgment of a pairwise comparison  
It would be also relevant to compare results using different number of point scale. In this context it is 
relevant to mention that Dawes (2008) found that a 5 or 7 point scale may produce slightly higher 
mean scores compared to those obtained from a 10 point scale. The main advantage of the 
transformation of the likert scale valuation compared to the traditional pairwise comparison is the 
number of questions required to answers. While, in the latter the number needed is N×(N-1)/2 and 
P×(P-1)/2, in the former the required number match up the number of product attributes (N) and 
levels (P), reducing drastically the number of comparisons and alleviating the answering process. 
Results show similar rank of the preferred attributes and levels from both methods. However 
significant differences are found between weights of some attributes and levels. More efforts are 
needed to obtain more empirical evidence of this comparison approach.
