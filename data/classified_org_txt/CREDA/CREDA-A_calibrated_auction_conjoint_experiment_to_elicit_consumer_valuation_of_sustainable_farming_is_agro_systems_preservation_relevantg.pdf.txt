Abstract 
This paper analyses the role of agro-systems preservation on making food choices. It 
employs the “Calibrate Auction-Conjoint Valuation method” (CACM), which relates 
hypothetical conjoint valuation of product attributes with real market behavior using real 
economic incentives. The paper also allows comparing the hypothetical and non-
hypothetical valuations in order to value the difference between the theoretic and the 
incentive-compatible WTP for a same respondent and within a single experiment. Thus 
the paper aims at testing for: 1) the internal consistency on people’s behavior towards 
sustainable agriculture, and 2) the relevance of the price attribute versus agro-ecosystems 
preservation for a fresh product. Results suggest that Spanish respondents’ valuation of 
an agricultural product highly depends on the type of system used for its production. 
Nevertheless, respondents mainly differ between sustainable and non sustainable 
production, and do not discriminate between organic and integrated systems. In addition, 
both the price and the protection of the environment are the most important elements 
taken into account when purchasing. Moreover, consumers tend to overestimate their 
WTP in hypothetical settings (60% of the sample). Finally, factors such as gender, 
respondents’ knowledge towards organic production and practices, health concerns, trust 
on organic marketing agents and risk perception are significant on explaining differences 
between individual’s hypothetical and non-hypothetical experiments. 
 
Introduction 
During the last decade, the significance of the results obtained from hypothetical 
valuation methods has been questioned. In particular, it has been noticed that consumers 
do not reveal their real economic behavior by means of hypothetical valuation questions, 
overestimating their real willingness to pay, in contrast to what happens in real economic 
incentive experiments, (e.g., List and Gallet, 2001, Lusk and Schroeder, 2004 and Lusk 
and Schroeder, 2006). The fact that real money is exchanged in experimental valuation 
methods can make participants to be more responsive of revealing their true value for a 
product in comparison with hypothetical survey settings. However, understanding why 
people mistake and overestimate their real willingness to pay for hypothetical questions 
remains an important issue. Therefore, the present study wants to consider the differences 
between hypothetical and incentive-compatible valuation mechanisms, for a specific case 
of agro-ecosystems preservation.  
 
The most widely used hypothetical valuation methods are conjoint analysis and Choice 
experiments. However, discrete choice and conjoint data do not offer immediate financial 
consequences for the participants. For that reason, researches investigate approaches to 
incorporate incentives into the traditional conjoint and choice methodologies.Incentive 
compatible elicitation mechanisms can be categorized in two general categories: 
experimental auctions and non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments or conjoint 
methodology (Lusk and Shogren, 2007 and Corrigan et al., 2009). One of the main 
features of the experimental auctions is to place subjects in an active market environment, 
where they can learn and adjust to market conditions (Lusk et al., 2006). In addition, bids 
directly allow researchers to estimate each participant’ WTP for one or several specific 
goods (Corrigan et al. 2009). In contrast, nonhypothetical choice experiments incorporate 
incentives into the traditional conjoint and choice methodology. It uses the traditional 



choice-based conjoint analysis methods, but randomly selects one of the several repeated 
choices between competing product profiles as the binding. The participant purchases the 
product indicated as most preferred in the randomly select choice set (Alfnes et al. 
(2006), Carlsson (2001), Ding, et al. (2005), Ding (2007) Lusk and Schoroeder (2004), 
Lusk et al., (2008)).  
 
Although incentive compatible elicitation mechanisms do achieve a more real WTP 
estimation, may not totally allow researchers to notice the rationality associated to 
individuals choices. As Lusk and Schoroeder (2007) pointed out, experimental researches 
aim at balancing control (over the environment) and context (contextual cue about the 
implication of their decision). But for the case of experimental auctions, a high attention 
to the control is given (Lusk and Schoroeder, 2007), while subjects does not have 
contextual cues. In order to deal with this, the present study follows Norwood and Lusk 
(2010) and employs an elicitation setting that promotes more systematic and rational 
behavior: the so called Calibrated Auction Conjoint Method (CACM). The CACM 
combine the strengths of the conjoint and auction value elicitations mechanisms. In this 
methodology people calibrate their attribute-bases utility function to produce the auction 
bids they desire. The CACM have several advantages over existing valuation approaches. 
First, it generates consistent and systematic responses by linking auction bids with 
conjoint ratings. Second, the CACM is an iterative valuation process that promotes 
learning and provides feedback for the formation of rational preferences. Third, it allows 
for a distribution-free characterization of heterogeneity in preferences, and finally the 
CACM allows for the evaluation of a large number of attributes and attribute-levels and 
permits the estimation of people’s values for a very large number of products (Norwood 
and Lusk, 2010). 
 
The present study conducted a CACM to examine consumer valuation of sustainable 
farming (organic and integrated) following Norwood and Lusk (2010).  Our main 
contribution is that in addition of linking the auction bids with the conjoint rating to 
investigate consumers’ preferences towards sustainable farming, we compare the 
hypothetical and no hypothetical valuations in order to verify: first the internal 
consistency on people’s behavior, and second the relevance of the price attribute versus 
agro-ecosystems preservation in the food market for a fresh product.    
The structure of the article is as follows. Next section explores the background on organic 
and integrated farming systems. The third section is devoted to the description of the 
methods, data and analytical procedures, while section four reports the results. Finally, 
section five portrays some concluding remarks. 
 
Background on Organic and Integrated farming Systems 
There are two main sustainable farming production systems in Spain: Integrated and 
Organic Farming. These production systems meet the potentially conflicting challenges at 
farm level, in a manner that balances food production, profitability, safety, animal 
welfare, social responsibility and environmental care. Organic farming is a production 
system that combines best environmental practices and the application of high-animal 
welfare standards. It also restricts the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and 
livestock is farmed with restrictions in terms of use of drugs and hormones (Magistris and 



Gracia 2008; Michaledou and Hassan, 2009). It is considered a form of sustainable 
agriculture, which means that the sources of food production cause lower degradation of 
the ecological system compared with conventional production systems (Quenum, 2010). 
On the other hand, integrated farming is defined as an agricultural system of food 
production and other high quality products, which use resources and natural regulation 
mechanisms to avoid adverse contributions to the environment and also ensures long-
term sustainable agriculture (International Organization for Biological Control, IOBC). 
One of the differences between organic and integrated production is that crop protection 
in the case of integrated production combines the use of biological controls for pest 
control with traditional techniques based on agrochemicals, while organic farming 
prohibits the use of synthetic agrochemicals (Miret, 2004). It is important to highlight 
that integrated farming is not considered by any European regulation, and therefore each 
member state have its own regulation with the consequent differences among countries. 
Nevertheless, there is a initiative named “European Initiative for Sustainable 
Development in Agriculture (EISA)” which tries to eliminate the “gap” between the 
different European regulations regarding to integrated production by establishing a 
definition of Integrated farming (IF) as well as setting some guidelines at the European 
level. In Spain it is regulated by REAL DECRETO 1201/2002 which establishes the 
general characteristics and requirements for integrated agriculture. From a survey done in 
2010 by the Spanish ministry of agriculture, Spain dedicates 601,394 hectares to 
integrated production and 988,323.67 hectares to organic production.  
 

Methods, data and analytical procedure 
The data  
 
The data used in this study was collected by means of an experiment with real economic 
incentives.  To carry out the experiment specific “software” was developed using Visual 
Basic programming for Microsoft Excel. A sample of Barcelona population, selected by a 
marketing research company, was recruited for the purpose of this study.  Participants 
were recruited by phone to participate in a computer-based survey for an “apple 
preference study”. Eight sessions of 10 participants were carried out in March 2010. In 
brief, the sample was made up of 40% men and 60% women. Almost 70% of the 
respondents are in between 35 and 65 years old. And as expected, the majority of the 
sample (more than 80%) has finished secondary school and revealed to have medium 
household income levels (from 1000 to 5000 Euros/month family). 
 
Experiment design 
 
The experiment was conducted in three stages1. 1) Welcome and introduction to the 
experiment; 2) survey and 3) CACM. During the introductory stage each respondent was 
allocated in a cubicle with a computer. Then, a brief explanation about the experiment 
objectives and confidentiality of the data was done.  Respondents were requested to 

                                                 
1
 First of all, a pilot experiment was conducted. Its aim was to test both the “software” 

developed for the CACM experiment and the methodology that would be used for the 
auction. A total of 10 participants (students and colleagues) were employed. 



behave as in real live and not as they wanted to behave. Finally, respondents received the 
payment of 20 Euros for their participation in the experiment. 
 
During the second stage, the survey, respondents were requested to answer a computer 
based survey with questions about organic purchase behavior, risk perception of 
agricultural products, environmental attitudes, the influence of social norms on 
respondents behavior, trust on organic market agents and, finally, the importance of price 
for respondents purchase intentions.  As well, some socio-demographic questions where 
requested. This stage starts with some instructions about the “software” use. Researchers 
asked participants not to be ahead in responding the survey, so everyone would answer at 
the same time and if any questions arose during the experiment would be easier to ask for 
help. 
 
Finally, the last stage of the experiment consists of the CACM. Following (Norwood and 
Lusk, 2010) respondents were first asked to rank their preference towards different 
characteristics associated to three different production systems (organic, integrated and 
conventional production). In order to select and define the attributes associated to the 
different production systems a focus group with experts was previously performed by the 
research team. The attributes selected were price, environmental impact, the use of 
fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, plant material, post-harvest treatments and, finally, 
certification (see table 2 for a description of attributes and levels as they were delivered 
to respondents). Before starting this stage of the experiment, a cheap talk to eliminate the 
hypothetical bias was introduced. We explained to the consumers that their answers could 
affect the final price of the product, so we ask them to be careful and think about their 
answers. Collection of data for the CACM proceeded in three steps: 

 
Step 1: participants were shown numerous tables, in the computer screen, corresponding 
to each of the attributes studied, and in each table, people were asked to rate the 
desirability of each attribute-level on a 1 to 10scale, where one was very undesirable and 
10 was very desirable.  In each case, and previous to participant’s evaluation, a full 
description of what each level represented was provided (See figure 1 as an example).  
 
Figure 1.Rate the desirability of attributes levels 

 
 
Step 2: participants were asked to indicate the relative importance of each attribute when 
purchasing apples on a 1 to 7  scale, where 1 was very unimportant and 7 was very 



important (see figure 2). Respondents were encouraged not to rate everything as very 
important, but rather to think about the relative importance.

Step 3: the last step of the CACM consisted of an auction2. The bids had to be the highest 
amount of money that they were willing to pay for the product. Furthermore consumers 
were told that the winner would have to pay for the kilo of apples that would be selected 
following the procedure commented below. Participants were asked to bid for a kilo of 
convention apple. Following Norwood and Lusk (2010), a bid was forecasted for each of 
the other products (organic and integrated) using each person’s previous responses to the 
ranking questions. To estimate the willingness to pay of each individual for each apple 
we followed Lusk y Norwood (2010). First, each individual i’s attribute-based utility for 
a kilogram of each apple type j     was calculated multiplying the relative importance 
of each attribute, using data obtained from the stages 1 and 2 of the CACM as follows: 
 

(1)  ∑ ∑   
 
Where,  represent the stated importance of the  attribute, considering ∑ =1. 
Further,   represent the rating of the  of the  attribute, normalized so that the 
lowest rated level of each attribute has a scaled rating of 0 and the highest rated level of 
each attribute has a scaled rating of 1. Besides,   is the number of levels over which the 

 attribute is varied, K is the number of attributes, and  is a dummy variable that 
equals 1 if the product processes the  level of the  attribute, and 0 otherwise. The 
term  can be interpreted as a utility “part-worth,” which is the utility provided from 
the  level of the  attribute. This part-worth is analogous to the coefficients in a 
random utility model estimated from a conjoint analysis, with   being the explanatory 
variable for the presence of absence in the conjoint analysis.  

 
Lastly, the willingness-to-pay to have one product versus another was calculated dividing 
equation (1) by the “part-worth” on price, which represents the marginal utility of income 
(Lusk y Norwood, 2010). The forecasted bits were shown to people together with the 
relative importance of each attribute level on its final bid by means of a bar chart (see 
figure 3).

 For that, people were trained on the bidding procedures uses. Consumers participated in 

an auction for a mineral water 33cl bottle to familiarize them with the procedures. The 
mineral water was design to mimic the apple auctions to facilitate the learning process. 



Participants had the opportunity to change the relative importance of each product 
attribute by means of a drop-down box. Simultaneously to the adjustment of the attribute 
importance people could see how their bids were changing for the three types of apples. 
The participants had to press the button submit when they were satisfied. Their final bids 
appeared in the screen. One production system (conventional, organic and integrated) 
was randomly selected. The highest bidder for the chosen type of apples was announced 
as the winner of the auction. (S)he took the chosen apples at home after paying the 
second highest bid.  
 
Analytical procedures 
 
To understand differences between participants’ hypothetical and the non hypothetical 
bids a Tobit model was specified as in all cases hypothetical bids were lower or equal to 
the non hypothetical ones.   
 
For each observation , 1, … , , the dependent variable of the Tobit model is defined 
by (Gourieroux, 2000): 
 

 ,  
, ,

 

 
where .  is a vector of unknown parameters containing K elements  is a 
vector comprising observations corresponding to the elements of , and the  
elements are the (known) thresholds. The error terms  are assumed to be independent 
and to have conditional density functions   and distributions .  
 
Results  
Main results from the CACM are shown in table 3. We start by reporting the bids for a 
kilogram of apples from each of three production systems and for each experiment 
(hypothetic and no hypothetic). In the hypothetical experiment the average bid for a 
kilogram of apples from conventional production system was 1.15€. This value increased 
to 3.65€ for apples from integrated production systems and to 4.14€ for apples from 
organic production systems. It is interesting to see that for the non-hypothetical 
experiment the average bid for a conventional system remained the same as for the 
hypothetical case 1.15€. However, the value for the apples from the integrated production 
systems was of 2.76€. This implies a decrease of 24% compared with the hypothetical 
case. Furthermore, the average bid for apples from organic production systems was of 
3.15€, 0.99€ less than the hypothetical bid.  
 
Additionally, results show that in hypothetical experiments participants’ revealed a 
higher willingness to pay for organic and integrated apples than in a incentive compatible 
setting. These results are consistent with List and Gallet (2001), Lusk and Schroeder 
(2004), and Lusk and Schroeder (2006).  This difference can respond to the fact that in 
the hypothetical experiment, even having introduced the cheap talk, there was neither a 
real interchange of goods, nor money involved, so probably all attributes were value in a 
conceptual way. However, when introducing real money in the experiment and therefore 



making it closer to reality, the price plays a more important role. In this last case 
respondent give priority to price, scarifying some other features.

Figure 8 reports the difference between the willingness to pay for the hypothetical and 
non hypothetical experiment for a kilogram of both organic and integrated apples. It can 
be observed that about 43% of people revealed a difference equal or less than 0.20 euros 
between the hypothetical and non hypothetical experiment for the two production 
systems. This indicates that more than the 40% of the sample answered the hypothetical 
experiment in a rational way, and therefore maintained very similar bits, for the non 
hypothetical experiment.

In order to deeply analyze the differences between the hypothetical and non hypothetical 
bits, Figure 9 and 10 shows respondents’ average ranking of the relative importance of 
the attributes associated to the productions systems for both the hypothetical and non 
hypothetical experiment respectively.  
 
As expected, the most important attribute is price. However, it can be observed that the 
attribute environmental protection is also very important for the sample, followed by the 
use of pesticides. The rest of the attributes were considered as equal important. It must be 
also highlighted that when moving from the hypothetical to the non hypothetical 
experiment, price relevance increases in about 16%.  However, it is interesting to observe 
that when respondents modify the relative importance of the rest of the attributes to 
increase the importance of price they maintain almost the same ranking order as they

Table 4 shows the average willingness to pay for selected changes in all attribute levels 
for apples. That is, the WTP for shifting from one level on a specific attribute to another 
level of the same attribute.  
 
Results are presented for the hypothetical and the non-hypothetical bids. In the 
hypothetical setting, we can observe a positive WTP to shift from conventional 
production to organic or integrated production for all attributes. However no significant 
differences can be observed if we compare the two sustainable production systems. For 
the non-hypothetical setting respondents are not willing to pay for changing between 
environmentally friendly productions systems and they prefer the conventional setting.  
 
In order to control for socioeconomic and attitudinal differences among respondents, it 
has been performed a tobit analysis of respondents WTP differences between the 
hypothetical and the non hypothetical experiment. Results from the organic and the 
integrated production systems are shown in Table 6.  
 
As can be observed, when valuing organic apples, men are less consistent that women as 
for the former significant differences between the theoretical and the incentive 
compatible bids (WTP3-WTP2). Other significant elements that affect respondents’ 
differences in their WTP for organic systems are trust and price importance. We can see 
that when respondents assign a higher relative importance to the price attribute the 
difference between hypothetical and non-hypothetical bids is larger. For the case of trust, 
either high or low levels of trust in organic marketing agents have a negative impact on

the difference between hypothetical and non-hypothetical bids. Furthermore, the 
variables subjective knowledge and health concerns have a positive impact on the 
difference between the hypothetical and non-hypothetical bids. The contrary occurs with 
objective knowledge; the higher the objective knowledge level is the lower differences 
between hypothetic and non hypothetic bids are. Lastly, results show that respondent’s 
perception of organic food as not equal3 to conventional is also significant. Respondents 
that perceive organic food not equal to conventional food are more consistent between 
their theoretical and incentive compatible bids.

*Integrated: Obs =72, Log likehood =-39.89, LRchi2(36) = 136.68, Pseudo R2 = 0.6314 
*Organic: Obs = 72, Log likehood =-55.46, LRchi2(36) = 125.75, Pseudo R2 = 0.5314 
  
 
Results obtained for the integrated system are similar than those mentioned above for the 
organic system, in relation to the variables price importance, trust and objective 
knowledge. Other significant elements that affect respondents’ differences in their WTP 
for integrated systems are income and education level. The higher the education and 
income levels are the lower differences between hypothetic and non hypothetic bids are. 
In addition, the variable risk perception shows that respondents with high level of risk do 
reveal significant differences between their hypothetic and non-hypothetical WTP.  
Finally, it can be observed that subjective knowledge and health concern are significant 
and have a negative impact on respondents’ differences between their hypothetic and 
non-hypothetical WTP. 
 
Conclusions 
This study compared hypothetical conjoint valuation experiment and incentive 
compatible experiments using the Calibrated Auction – Conjoint Valuation Method 
proposed for Norwood and Lusk 2010. The CACM methodology has been used to 
estimate of people’s values for environmentally friendly production systems, named 
organic and integrated farming. The advantage of the CACM, is that the auction bid can 
be de-composed to identify the attributes and the attribute levels that make people willing 
to pay more for an organic or integrated apple in comparison with a conventional one. 
The CACM methodology allows respondents to develop a rational behavior in the 
bidding experiment. In addition, this study attempts to value the differences between a 



hypothetic and incentive-compatible choice for a same respondent and within a unique 
experiment.  
 
Our results show that people’s valuation of apples is affected by the production system, 
and that Spanish respondents place a higher value on organic products in comparison 
with the ones obtained front integrated or conventional production. On average, 
respondents are willing to pay 3.5 and 4.14 Euros for a kilogram of integrated and 
organic apples respectively, for the non-hypothetical bid. For the incentive compatible 
experiment the biding decreased to 2.76 and 3.15 Euros respectively.  
 
In addition, it has been noticed that from the set of attributes associated to a production 
system (price, environmental impact, the use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, 
plant material, post-harvest treatments and finally certification) the one with a higher 
relative importance is the price followed by the environmental impact of the production 
system. This fact would explain, at least portray, the differences found when we compare 
results from a hypothetical and a non-hypothetical setting.  However it is important to 
highlight that when respondents decrease the WTP due to the introduction of the 
monetary incentive, is was done in a rational way, that is the relative importance of the 
other attributes were maintained in the same relative proportion as in the first bidding.   
 
Our study also suggests that there are some factors that can explain why participants bid 
in a different way in hypothetical vs. non hypothetical settings. In particular, more 
inconsistencies have been found in relation to gender, respondents’ knowledge about 
organic production and practices, risk perception, price importance and health concerns.
