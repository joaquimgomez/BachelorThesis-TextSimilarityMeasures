1. INTRODUCTION: Socio economic context in Catalonia
POLITICAL CHANGES have also occurred in Catalonia
Members of Parliament strongly in favor of an INDEPENDENT CATALONIA increased 7,4% (elections of 2012)
Massive POPULAR MOBILIZATIONS in Catalonia after the long awaited decision of the Constitutional Court about the new Statute of Autonomy
Plus, the MAIN NATIONALIST PARTY in Catalonia (CIU), has SHIFTED from nationalism to Catalan independentism (Guibernau, M., 2013, amongst others)

7.4% in comparison with During elections
The clearly pro-independence parties in Catalonia are: ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya), CUP (Candidatura d’Unitat Popular), and the current non-represented SI (Solidaritat Catalana per la Independència).

Thus, the OBJECTIVE of this paper is:
To determine CONSUMERS’ RED WINE PREFERENCES for a special occasion and,
More specifically, their CHANGES regarding the newer economic and political scenario
We applied 2 DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTS (DCE), BEFORE and DURING the economic crisis (1TBefore vs.3TDuring)

Many consumers perceive wine as a complex product and are likely to exhibit some form of risk reduction behaviour during its purchase.
Experience product: make their decision based on the information available on the label and bottle.
Consumers will only use a small amount of all the available information to make a decision 




BRAND
Are capable of acting as a SURROGATE for a number of attributes (including quality) and might help address RISK while providing product cues

2. CONSUMERS- PREFERENCES TOWARDS WINE
PRICE
When consumers do not have information about the product, it generally performs as a PROXY to infer the quality of the product when:
The product cannot be evaluated
The RISK of making a wrong choice is high

3. METHODOLOGY: The DCE: Econometric model




The basic model is THE MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL (MNL). 



It imposes homogeneity in preferences for observed attribute
The IIA  property seldom hold.

3. METHODOLOGY: The DCE: Econometric model
The Mixed Logit Model (MIXL)

Extend the MNL introducing for unobserved heterogeneity by allowing random coefficients on attributes .
Recent studies argued that much of the PREFERENCE HETEROGENEITY captured by random parameters in MIXL can be better captured by the scale term; and thus known as “SCALE HETEROGENEITY”.
The MIXL turns to be likely a POOR APPROXIMATION to stated data if scale heterogeneity is not accounted for

3. METHODOLOGY: The DCE: Econometric model
	The Generalized Multinomial Logit Model (GMNL)

Known also as Generalized Mixed Logit Model (G-MXL).
 n is a scaling factor that proportionately scales the  up or down for each individual n.
 is a mixing parameter, and its value determines the level of mixing or interaction between the scale heterogeneity coefficient and the parameter heterogeneity coefficient .

4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: Sample
2 IDENTICAL SURVEYS performed in 2 DIFFERENT TIMES: 
BEFORE & DURING the ECONOMIC CRISIS.
		Before	During
	Population	Consumers over 18 years who purchase regularly food and are residents in the metropolitan area of Barcelona.	
	Sample Design 	Stratified sample by age and postal districts using proportional affixation to the number of persons by stratum.	
	Field	Metropolitan area of Barcelona	
	Sample Size	400	401
	Confidence interval	 4.9	± 4,9%
	Confidence level	95.5% (k=2)	95.5% (k=2)
	Control measure	Pilot survey (25 questionnaires)	


Paper prepared for presentation at the EAAE-AAEA Joint Seminar 
“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy

Structured face-to-face questionnaire over a 4-week period
Respondents should be at least 18 years of age (legal drinking age) + purchased a bottle of wine within the last 3 months
Recruited in major supermarkets and in one of the central streets of the city of Barcelona
The fieldwork was subcontracted to a company specialised in marketing research. 
Each respondent was given 20€ 
17

To reduce wine choice complexity we delimited our wine selection by focusing on a RED WINE purchased for a SPECIAL OCCASION such as Christmas.
Based on the literature and discussion groups we identified the following attributes and levels:
ORIGIN: Catalonia (regional), Spain (national), Imported (international)
WINE REFERENCES: Own Experience, Recommendation, Prestige
GRAPE VARIETY: Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Merlot
PRICE: €6, €10, €14
4. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: Attributes and levels




Paper prepared for presentation at the EAAE-AAEA Joint Seminar 
“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy

The wine origin is the factor that interested us the most
References: wine characteristics related to risk reduction, the main RRS when purchasing high-priced wines 
Mtimet and Albisu (2006) found that the consumers chose the only possible French variety that was presented (Cabernet Sauvignon). In our choice experiment, two French varieties were introduced 
The price levels were chosen based on the fact that the purchase was meant for a special occasion, and do not reflect the mean wine market prices in Spain
18

We followed the DUAL RESPONSE CHOICE EXPERIMENT design.
From the FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN using the total number of attributes and levels which led to a total of 81 hypothetical products. In a choice set of 2 alternatives we have 6,561 possible combinations.
The orthogonal fractional factorial design with only 9 CHOICE SETS.

All attributes, including the price, were coded with EFFECT CODING as discrete variables
To avoid the base levels being CONFOUNDED WITH THE INTERCEPT   Effects of all levels can be estimated
All models were estimated by using 500 Halton draws.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Both models are statistically significant and exhibited a good fit with highly significant likelihood ratios.
Consumers’ preferences are higher for the CATALAN ORIGIN of the product, for the grape variety CABERNET SAUVIGNON and, for wines that have been PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED 

Practically all SIGNIFICANT

A greater utility for the No choice intercept
In During consumers show a greater preference for not taking the product, indicating PERSISTENCE IN THE UNOBSERVED ATTRIBUTES

“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy

Spanish wines gather the highest market share in Catalonia: the political changes that have occurred through the period of study might explain this fact

	Weighting parameter Gamma (γ)	.10053**	.57052***

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Common circumstances may have had a HOMOGENISING INFLUENCE


In “During” model it becomes NON-SIGNIFICANT: the VARIATION OF THE DEGREE of RANDOMNESS in their final decision and hence their degree of UNCERTAINTY DECREASED significantly.
Tau parameter (KEY PARAMETER) captures the SCALE HETEROGENEITY

Paper prepared for presentation at the EAAE-AAEA Joint Seminar 
“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy

Τ: scale heterogeneity decreases.
in During, the variation of the degree of randomness in consumers’ decisions has decreased significantly and, thus has the degree of uncertainty in the decision-making process. This finding might show a great impact of socio economic changes in the environment on consumers’ decision-making towards wine. In this sense, external common circumstances may have had a homogenising influence.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

GAMMA in both models is SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT from ZERO. 
TASTE heterogeneity is PARTIALLY CONDITIONED to SCALE heterogeneity. 
In “During” model, however, they become more INDEPENDENT (Gamma increases from 0.10 to 0.57)

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the “During the crisis” model,
Spanish wine’s show a NOT SIGNIFICANT UTILITY but its TASTE HETEROGENEITY TURNS SIGNIFICANT
Catalan wines show again a SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE UTILITY and its TASTE HETEROGENEITY TURNS NOT SIGNIFICANT 
Furthermore, the SCALE HETEROGENEITY = ZERO  CONSUMERS’ PREFERENCES TOWARDS CATALAN wines have become CLEAR

28

6. CONCLUSIONS
Consumers’ preferences are higher for the CATALAN ORIGIN of the product, for the grape variety CABERNET SAUVIGNON and for wines that have been PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED
The CATALAN ORIGIN of the wine shows a SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE UTILITY IN BOTH SURVEYS, which reveals the importance of the Catalonian identity in the consumer behaviour.
However, During the crisis, this quality is HOMOGENEOUS ACROSS CONSUMERS (does not show any unobservable heterogeneity). 
This finding is in ACCORDANCE with the POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

Paper prepared for presentation at the EAAE-AAEA Joint Seminar 
“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy


29

6. CONCLUSIONS
SPANISH WINES shows a NON-SIGNIFICANT UTILITY During the crisis, this occurs in spite of gathering the highest market share in Catalonia, which suggests an influence of the political changes

“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy


30

6. CONCLUSIONS
The GMNL model has shown to be appropriated to DECOUPLE both UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITIES
Has provided us with more information about the SOURCE OF CONSUMERS’ HETEROGENEITY
In the “During” model: the results for the SCALE HETEROGENEITY indicate that the degree of uncertainty in the decision-making process has DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. 
This finding might show an IMPACT OF SOCIO ECONOMIC CHANGES in the environment of consumers’ decision-making towards wine. In this sense, external common circumstances may have had a HOMOGENIZING INFLUENCE.
