Abstract 

The European societies are requiring that animals to be raised as closely as possible to their 
natural conditions. The growing concerns about animal welfare is resulting in continuous 
modifications of regulations and policies that led to ban of a number of intensive farming 
methods. The European authorities consider the pig welfare as a priority issue. They are 
studying to ban surgical pig castration by 2018, which may seriously affect markets and 
consumers due to boar tainted-meat. This study analysed consumers’ preferences and 
acceptance regarding an alternative to castration of high-level boar-taint frankfurter sausages. 
Non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments was applied by creating a real shopping scenario 
before and after tasting the products. Data were collected for a sample of 150 consumers from 
the metropolitan area of Madrid, Spain. Different modelling approaches (Generalized Multinomial 
Logit-GMNL, Random Parameters Logit-RPL, WTP-space and Latent Class-LC models) were 
applied to figure out which model have the best goodness of fit. Results showed the 
appropriateness of the proposed alternative by using a new flavour as a masking strategy. When 
consumers tasted the products, they showed their willingness to pay a premium for this flavour. 
The WTP space model showed the best goodness of fit in terms of likelihood, Akaike information 
criterion and McFadden Pseudo R2. Furthermore, the degree of randomness identified by the 
scale parameter is also estimated. Uncertainty in selection decreased significantly after the 
sensory experience. 

 

Key Words: Consumers preference, Boar taint, Non-Hypothetical Choice Experiments. 

 

1. Introduction 

Animal welfare is becoming a prominent politically sensitive matter In Europe. Consumers are 
demanding products with high animal welfare standards to ensure humane production systems 
(EC, 2007). European societies are requiring that animals to be raised as closely as possible to 
their natural conditions regarding the available space and flooring quality and slaughtered in a 
painless manner (Harper & Hensen, 2001). The growing concerns about animal welfare resulted 
in continuous modifications of regulations and policies that led to ban of a number of intensive 
farming methods (Kallas et al., 2013). 

The European authorities considered the pig welfare as a priority issue within its agenda due to 
its controversial intensive production systems and because pork is the most produced and 
consumed meat in the EU (FAOSTAT, 2013). The latest approved change on pig welfare that 
became effective by January 2012, is the Council Directive 2008/120/EC that banned the use of 
sow stalls, which are cramped pens in which pregnant sows are kept in a solitary state without 
being able to turn around. 

Another controversial aspect within the pig production systems is the castration issue. The 
castration of entire male is legally (2001/93/EC) performed without anaesthetics during the first 
seven days after birth. After this date castration should be performed under anaesthesia and 
analgesia administrated by a qualified veterinarian. However, due to cost and other 
management issues, approximately 40% of the total EU pig production is surgically castrated 
without anaesthesia (Fredriksen et al., 2009). There is evidence that castration at any age is 
painful (SPAHW, 2004) and therefore, the EU is considering banning the surgical pig castration 
by January 2018 (EC, 2010). 

2 



Why to castrate? The castration of male piglets is an important step in obtaining meat that fit the 
quality standards. It avoids boar taint (known as sexual odour), which is a distinctive and 
unpleasant odour, flavour and taste. Literature showed that not all consumers are sensitive to 
boar taint as it depends on regions, countries, pork consumption habits and gender (Font-i-
Furnols et al., 2016.). For instance, consumers that could reject tainted meat are between 52.5–
79.2% in Spain, 52.4–79.6% in United Kingdom and 43.1–73.6% in France (Blanch et al., 2012), 
while this percentage in Russia and China is 37% and 32% respectively (Font-i-Furnols et al., 
2016). Therefore, the EU regulation of meat hygiene puts such emphasis on this issue by the 
EC Directive 842/2004 that states that “meat manifesting a pronounced sexual odor is to be 
declared unfit for human consumption” (Whittington et al., 2011). 

In this context, alternatives to castration is a relevant issue to study (Heid & Hamm, 2012). Such 
alternatives should ensure both the quality and sensory standards and improve pig welfare. 
Among the different available alternatives, we mention; the genetic selection of ‘low-taint’ breed, 
improved management strategies at farm level, slaughtering at an early weight and masking the 
boar-tainted meat with different processing procedure. The latest alternative is one of the most 
explored strategy because boar taint meat are more accepted by consumers if it is adequately 
commercialized within the processed pig meat sector (Gunn et al., 2004). 

The main objective of this study is threefold: first, to analyse consumers’ expected preference 
towards a new masking strategy of boar taint meat used to produce frankfurter sausages by 
means of a flavour developed by herbs and natural smoking. Second, to analyse, after tasting 
the products and creating a real eating experience, how expectations toward the “masked” 
frankfurter sausages are affected. Third, to compare the preferences results between different 
modelling approaches. 

To achieve the abovementioned objectives, we followed a methodological approach that 
attempted to mimic consumer reactions (Meillon et al., 2010) when facing a new product based 
on the Total Food Quality Model (Grunert et al., 1996). According to this approach, before 
purchasing a food product, consumers build expectations about its quality because the sensory 
attributes cannot be revealed. Thus, extrinsic attributes are the main driven factors to purchase 
in this case. Then, when the product is tasted or consumed, consumers may judge its quality. At 
the end, the eating experience and expectations are integrated, allowing researchers to better 
understand consumers’ preferences and the decision of the consumers to repurchase the 
product or not. 

Preferences were analysed using two non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments (DCE) by 
creating a real shopping scenario before and after a hedonic sensory test. Different frankfurter 
sausages defined by several attributes were presented to respondents in different choice sets. 
Respondents were asked to select their preferred product revealing their preference for 
attributes and levels. The relative importance or WTP can be estimated as one of the attribute is 
the price. 

Data were collected from a sample of 150 consumers in Madrid, Spain1. Consumers in the 
recruitment process were compensated by €15. Before the real choice experiments, participants 
were awarded by an additional €5 without prior notification in order to participate in a created 
shopping scenario. Individuals who agreed to participate were asked to purchase their selected 
product from a randomly chosen choice set and to pay its price. 

1 It is relevant to take into consideration the relatively small size of the sample when interpreting the results. The setting cost of 
the the experiment using non-hypothetical experiment with real product produced and formulated by authors, the real shopping 
scenario with money exchange and the eating experience test was very high.

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. The experiment framework 

We followed a methodological approach that can be briefly described in six steps: 

1. Participants answered a first questionnaire regarding behaviour and attitudes when 
consuming pork meat and frankfurter sausages. Demographic, socioeconomic variables 
were collected. 

2. Without prior notification, consumers were awarded by an additional €5 and asked to select 
their preferred products from choice sets in a DCE framework. They were warned that a 
binding choice scenario will be drawn and they should purchase their selected product or 
neither. 

3. Hedonic sensory test was carried out. Consumers tasted four different frankfurter sausages 
and created their individual eating experience. 

4. Consumers were informed about which sausages they tasted. They were given five minutes 
to verify their liking scores with sausages types.  

5. Consumers were asked to select again their preferred products from the same DCE but in 
this case they were asked to take into consideration their sensory experience. 

6. Finally, a randomly selected choice set was drawn from both DCE (i.e. before and after 
tasting). Consumers were asked to purchase their chosen Frankfurter sausage and pay its 
price. If the “no-purchase” option” was selected, then no product is not delivered. 

 

2.2. Sample and data collection 

Data were collected following a quota sampling approach stratified by gender, age and postal 
districts. A sample of 150 consumers from the metropolitan area of Madrid were compensated 
with €15 for participating in the experiment. The recruitment was carried out by Silliker Ibérica 
(S.A.) using the following selection criteria: household responsible for purchasing food and 
beverages and who have consumed frankfurter sausages at least once in the last month. Data 
were obtained in a controlled environment from a self-completed questionnaire with open ended 
questions. A summary of their main socio-demographic variables are presented in Table 1.

2.3. The hedonic test 

Consumers tasted four different frankfurter sausages with two different treatments: meat from 
castrated pigs or boars with an original flavour or flavoured with spices and naturally smoked. 
The Frankfurter sausages were prepared in a pilot plant according to industrial procedures. The 
basic recipe to manufacture flavoured sausages, the natural spice mixture and the smoking 
procedure is described in detail in Martínez et al. (2016). The masking strategy includes a 
natural spice mixture that contains white pepper, paprika, mustard seed, nutmeg mace, 
coriander, sweet marjoram and small green cardamom. Consumers’ test were performed in a 
room equipped with individual tasting booths with controlled environment as can be seen in 
Figure 1. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: Data collection in individual tasting booths with controlled environment. 

 
 

The sensory evaluation was carried out on two consecutive days with different sessions of about 
10 consumers by session. Participants rated odour, flavour and overall acceptability of the four 
sausages using a nine-point category scale (1 ‘dislike extremely’; 2 ‘dislike very much’; 3 ‘dislike 
moderately’; 4 ‘dislike slightly’; 5 ‘neither like nor dislike’; 6 ‘like slightly’; 7 ‘like moderately’; 8 
‘like very much’; and 9 ‘like extremely’). 

2.4. The Discrete Choice experiment 

2.3.1. Attributes and choice sets 

Because of the unfeasibility to cope with all attributes and levels that deals with meat 
preferences in general and Frankfurter sausage in particular, we selected some of the most 
important ones, focusing on the attributes that we were interested in. Several attributes 

5 



regarding the meat products preferences were identified. Another limitation in our case study 
was to avoid “deception”. Deception is defined as an act or statement intended to make people 
believe something that is not true (Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2014). Since we were forced to 
deliver consumers the “exact” product presented in the choice sets when creating the shopping 
scenario, the selection of attributes was limited. In others words participants should get the 
“exact” product they paid for. Therefore, we select only the attributes that we were able to control 
and “produce”. Behavioral economic is in general strict about using deception in economic 
experiments, while other disciplines (e.g. psychology) allow it. There are arguments in favor 
(Bonetti 1998) and against it (Jamison, et al., 2008). There is no clear guideline about which 
deceptive practices, if any, should be allowed in experimental economics research (Colson et 
al., 2015). Recently Rousu et al (2015) and describe the ways deception can be employed in 
applied economics experiments and they examines the cases for and against deception. 

Thus, in our case study, we focused on whether the meat was obtained from castrated animals 
or boars, if the sausage had an original flavor or was enriched with the masking strategy and if 
the product belongs to a manufacturer or a retailer brands. The latter attribute was generically 
identified due to the impossibility to cope with all the commercial brands of frankfurter sausages 
in the Spanish market. In this case, consumers were notified to consider their usual purchased 
manufacturer/retailer brand during the choice exercise. The latter attribute may resent a way of 
consumer deception because both brands were produced in our pilot plants. Finally, four 
attributes were selected: flavor (original or with a masking strategy of spices and naturally 
smoked), castration (meat obtained from castrated pigs or boars), brand type (manufacturer and 
private brands) and price (€1.79, €1.39, €0.99, €0.59) 

For the choice sets design we followed an orthogonal fractional factorial design to estimate the 
main effects obtaining eight choice sets. We considered four alternatives in each choice sets as 
this showed the highest D-efficiency. While the Discrete choice experiments involves the use of 
statistical design theory to construct choice scenarios, the emphasis is usually done on designs 
that yield parameter estimates that are not confounded by other factors. Hensher et al., (2005, 
page 116) mentioned that non-orthogonally tends to produce higher amounts of shared variation 
with lower unique variation from individual attribute estimates are derived. Parameters estimated 
from non-orthogonal designs are likely to be incorrectly estimated and, in some instances, have 
the incorrect sign. 

However, recently, other choice designs may outperform the orthogonal designs, especially 
when the combination obtained from the orthogonal array are not realistic which is not the case 
of our study since our choice sets contains all the possible combinations of the attributes’ levels 
that all of them were feasible. Of these designs, the D-optimal design is one of the recently 
applied which are is structured to increase the statistical performance (the minimization of 
standard errors on parameters estimates) with relatively smaller samples than are required for 
other designs such as orthogonal designs (Rose et al., 2008; Bliemer and Rose, 2011). In order 
to construct D-efficient designs, the analyst is required to assume prior parameter estimates in a 
Bayesian-like fashion. In this occasion, researchers should assume some parameter priors, 
generally obtained from a small pilot study. An example of a choice set is shown in Figure 2.

After the main choice task (i.e. the 8 choice sets), different follow-up questions were asked 
regarding attribute non-attendance, attributes order in a non-coincident 9-point Likert scale and 
a hold-out task which consisted of 8 products in a same choice set to test for consistency. 
Finally, at the end of the choice experiment exercise, a binding choice scenario was randomly 
drawn. Consumers should pay for the product they selected. Figure 3 show real products and 
the scenario created to exchange money and products.

2.5. Modelling the DCE 

The DCE rely on Lancaster’s theory of value (Lancaster, 1966), where the utility of a product is 
decomposed into separable and additive components of the utilities of its descriptors. It is also 
built on random utility theory (RUT) which suggests that subject n  chooses alternative j  
according to a utility function jnU  with a systematic jnV  and a random error term jnε . The utility 
depends also on socio-economic characteristics of individual, nS . 

( , )jn jn j n jnU V X S ε= +         (1) 

To predict the ‘probability of choice’ that an individual chooses an alternative from a choice set (
t ), McFadden (1974) developed the multinomial logit (MNL) model as a basis of the DCE 
analysis. 

According to this model, the utility of an alternative j in a choice set t for an individual n is:  
1,  ,   1,  ,   1,  ,  njt njt njt n n N j J tU x Tβ ε σ = … =+ = …= …    (2) 

Where, njtx is a vector of k attributes, β  is a vector of marginal utilities of attribute levels and njtε
is the ‘idiosyncratic’ error term with scale parameter nσ . In its basic form, the scale term is 
normalized to one for identification. In this case, the probability of choosing an alternative is:

However, it imposes homogeneity in preferences for the observed attribute by only estimating 
average attribute utilities, which is often unrealistic as consumers’ preferences are generally 
heterogeneous. The Mixed or heterogeneous logit models (MIXL), known also as random 
parameters logit model has been introduced to handle this heterogeneity 

 

2.5.1. The Random parameters logit model (RPL) 

The RPL model is commonly used in choice modelling. It extends the MNL, introducing 
unobserved heterogeneity by allowing random coefficients on attributes (Ben-Akiva et al., 1997). 
In this case, the utility of an alternative is specified as follows: 

1,  ,    1,  ,    1,  ( ) ,  njt n njt njt n N j J t TU x nβ η ε σ = … = … = …= + +   (4) 
where nη is the vector of deviations from the mean value of β  for each individual n that is 
specified by an underlying continuous distribution for the parameters defined by the researcher. 
In most applications, the multivariate normal distribution MVN (0, Σ) is used. In this case, nσ  is 
also assumed to take the value 1 for identification. 

Louviere and Mayer (2007) and Louviere et al. (2008) mentioned that much of the preference 
heterogeneity in the RPL model could be better explained by a scale term leading to ‘scale 
heterogeneity’ identification. They also stated that the distributions of the marginal utilities do not 
appear to be very close to normal as assumed in the majority of the applications. Thus, this 

8 



model turns to be likely a poor approximation if the scale heterogeneity is not accounted for 
(Fiebig et al., 2010). 

Scale heterogeneity refers to the differences of the variance of the error term across individuals. 
Specifically, it represents the variation of the degree of randomness in the decision-making 
process of respondents and is therefore the degree of individuals’ certainty. In this context, the 
analysis of scale heterogeneity is important, especially for stated preference studies such as 
those based on questionnaires. Consumers may interpret choice tasks differently depending on 
unobserved factors. Different levels of attention and different degree of certainty may exist in 
their choice (Train & Weeks, 2005) leading to different scale term by consumer. 

 

2.5.2. The Generalized Multinomial Logit model (GMNL) 

Feibig et al. (2010) proposed the generalized multinomial logit model (GMNL) approach where 
the scaling term nσ  is no longer assumed to be one for identification and it scales β s up or 
down for each individual n. In this case, the individual utility is specified as follows: 

[ γ (1 γ) ]njt n n n n njt njtU Xσ β η σ η ε= + + − +       (5) 
where [ ]γ 0,1∈  is a mixing parameter that determines the level of interaction between nσ  and 

nη . Fiebig et al. (2010) proposed that nσ  could follow a log-normal distribution with mean 1 and 
standard deviation τ . This latter term is a key parameter that captures the scale heterogeneity 
across consumers. 

Regarding the alternative specific constant (ASC)2, Fiebig et al. (2010) indicated that including it 
within the general GMNL specification may produce special estimation problems. In this context, 
Greene & Hensher (2010) proposed three possible ways to include the ASC within the utility 
specification: 1) consider ASCs as fixed parameters, assuming homogenous preference; 2) let 
ASCs behave like the attributes (ie, random and scaled) or 3) suppose the ASC is a random 
parameter and force no special scaling for it. 

 

2.5.3. The GMNL-WTP-space model 

As detailed by Greene and Hensher (2010), the GMNL model can be reparametrized to estimate 
parameters in WTP space. From equation 5, separating the price variable (p) and its coefficient

,( )p nβ , we obtain: 

'
,( p ) [γ (1 γ) ]njt n p n n njt n n n njt njtU X Xσ β β η σ η ε= − + + + − +     (6)

   (7) 

Normalizing the price coefficient of ,( )p nβ  of –p to 1 yields the WTP space specification:  

2 When the ASC accounts for the utility of the alternatives in a choice task including the no-choice option, it measures 
the intangible aspects that are not gathered up by the attributes’ utilities. 

9 

                                                 



'*( p ) [γ (1 γ) ]njt n n njt n n n njt njtU X Xσ β η σ η ε= − + + + − +     (8) 
where '*nβ  directly gives the individual-specific WTP estimates. This formulation bypasses the 
necessity of specifying the distribution of the ratio of two random parameters as in the traditional 
preference-space models, which might lead to skewed and dubious WTP distributions. 

 

2.5.4. The Latent Class model (LC) 

The latent class approach considers that observed heterogeneity of preferences can be 
analysed by grouping respondents into a discrete number of homogenous class of preferences, 
each having its own parameters. The LC approach does not require any assumption about the 
distribution of the parameters (Greene & Hensher, 2003). However, researcher has to decide the 
“best” number of classes to be extracted from the sample. The criteria used are based on the 
comparison of the Bayesian Information Indicator (BIC) or Akaike Information Indicator (AIK), 
McFadden pseudo R2 and plausibility of the results. The LC determine the probability of an 
individual to belong to the classes and the class probabilities of choosing one alternative 
conditional on the preferences within each class.  

According to this approach, the probability of an individual I belonging to a specific class 
{ }1,...,c C∈  of choosing one alternative { }1,..., Jj ∈  from a choice situation t is as:

Where cβ  is a vector of utility parameters specific of class c. As the research ignores which 
respondents is in which class, the model estimates the probability that individuals belong to a 
certain group. 

Finally, for the economic interpretation, once parameters are estimated, it is possible to 
determine its “implicit price” (IP):

2.6. Results 
 
2.6.1. Hedonic valuation of the Frankfurter sausages 

Results of the overall acceptability of tasting the four Frankfurter sausages are presented in 
Table 2. Significant differences were obtained at 95% using the Tukey test. Sausage with the 
masking strategy from castrated and non-castrated pigs showed the higher scores. This 
confirms that the proposed masking strategy had a positive effect on consumers’ acceptance. In 
this context, the original sausage from non-castrated pig received the lowest valuation score, 
which clearly shows the negative impact of boar taint on acceptance.

a, b, c, Statistical differences among types of frankfurter sausage for each sensory attribute at 95%. 
 

The key question is to verify if the consumers’ expected preferences has shifted significantly 
after the eating experience or not. We estimated different modelling approach with the GMNL, 
WTP-Space, RPL and LC models. Results are presented in the following section. 

 

2.6.2. Expected versus experiences preferences valuation of the Frankfurter sausages 

In this section, we present only3 the preliminary results of the different modelling approaches 
(Table 2). At a 99% confidence level, we can reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are 
jointly equal to zero with a Log-Likelihood ratio test highly significant. The goodness of fit is 
assessed through the McFadden’s pseudo R2 which is within the acceptable range for all the 
modelling approaches. The GMNL and the GMNL-WTP space models both before and after the 
eating experience showed the highest improvement in the likelihood and the best information 
criteria (AIC, BIC) over the RPL and the LC and the MNL4 models in line of the results of Fiebig 
et al. (2010), Greene & Hensher (2010) and Pancras & Dey (2011).  

 
The positive/negative sign of the coefficient implies higher/lower levels of utility associated with 
these attributes’ levels. In this context, the model estimates showed that all attribute coefficients 
are statistically significant except the boar animal level in the post sensory. All models showed a 
clear tendency toward a decreasing utility of the boar meat after the eating experience. Which 
confirms the acceptance results where this meat received the lowest scores. This result revealed 
that before the hedonic valuation experience, consumers exhibit a preference for meat obtained 
from pigs reared in natural condition (i.e. without castration) as a potential preference for a 
positive pig welfare. However, after the hedonic evaluation consumers preferred meats from 
castrated animal due to its effect on meat quality. We can clearly state that consumers in Spain 
(at least in the region where the study was carried out) would prefer meat quality than animal 
welfare. 

Consumers also showed a non-preference for private brands before and after tasting the 
product with relatively similar weights in both cases. Consumers also had negative expectations 
toward the masking strategy proposed in this study before tasting the products by exhibiting in 
all modelling approach a negative and significant marginal utility. However, expectations shifted 
in the direction of the positive utility after the sensory experience showing a relevant role of 
experience the products when new flavours or varieties is launched to markets. The experienced 
preferences confirmed the appropriateness of the masking strategy against boar taint.

As expected, the price marginal utilities revealed a significant negative sign. Results also 
showed that when consumers tasted the different products, the price relevance slightly 
decreased, demonstrating that the eating experience shifted preferences towards for a relatively 
higher prices. The no-choice option was not preferred in both experiments, with significant 
results before the sensory test showing that the products presented in the different choice sets 
were attractive. 

Regarding the different modelling approaches, all results showed similar results in terms of the 
sign of the different variables but with relatively some difference in the dimension of the 
estimates. The GMNL-WTP space model showed the highest goodness of fit in terms of 
Likelihood, Pseudo R2 and AIC criterion. Furthermore, the estimates of this model are directly 
the WTP for the different attributes’ levels showing a relative superiority against the other 
modelling approaches. 

For the tau parameter that captures the scale heterogeneity, results showed a significant value 
before the sensory test and a non-significant after the eating experience. Thus, the hedonic 
evaluation played a homogenizing role as the variation of the degree of randomness in the 
consumers’ final decision decreased significantly. 
 

2.7. Conclusions 

Results showed the appropriateness of the proposed masking strategy of boar tainted meat to 
be used as a raw material for the production of frankfurter sausages. The proposed flavour may 
represent a starting point for the processed meat industry to include boar-tainted meat for the 
production of frankfurter sausages. However, consumers in Spain would prefer meat quality than 
animal welfare as preference after experiencing the meat quality of non-castrated meat. How to 
ensure pig welfare by maintaining minimum standard of meat quality. Our findings highlight the 
importance of the direct promotion by offering the potential consumers the opportunity to taste 
the new product. Thus, promoting the new flavoured product in the point of sales decrease the 
randomness in selection and may increase the probability of purchasing. 

For the different modelling approaches applied, the GMNL-WTP-Space model showed the best 
goodness of fit. One advantage of this model is it avoid the necessity of specifying the 
distribution of the ratio of two random parameters, which improves the WTP distributions and 
confidence interval. The impact of the eating experience on the stated attributes non-attendance 
and on the internal and external validity of choices are proposed.
