ANIMAL WELFARE is becoming a relevant FACTOR affecting CONSUMER PREFERENCES.
Consumers are DEMANDING animals being reared, fed and housed AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE as they would in their NATURAL CONDITIONS.
1. INTRODUCTION: Background
The growing CONCERNS about ANIMAL WELFARE in EU are being extensively debated, resulting in CONTINUOUS CHANGES in regulations and POLICIES.

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 



1. INTRODUCTION: Background
EU regulations have led to BANS of a number of INTENSIVE farming methods.
In this context, PIG WELFARE has received and is still receiving special attention as pork is the MOST PRODUCED and consumed meat in the EU.
For instance, the Council Directive 2008/120/EC has BANNED the use of SOW STALLS by January 2012.

There is an associated MEAT (sensory) QUALITY problem

BOAR TAINT
Off-odour and  flavour related  to the accumulation of Androstenone and Skatole in the fat tissue


Consumers REACT DIFFERENTLY to this SMELL and therefore it can affect CONSUMERS’ ACCEPTABILITY of pork
CASTRATION of ENTIRE MALES’ pigs is carried out:
To ENCOURAGE the DEPOSIT OF FAT
To PREVENT aggressive BEHAVIOR problems
To AVOID the RISK of obtaining meat with BOAR TAINT
1. INTRODUCTION: Background


We all know that surgical castration of entire male pigs has been carried out for many ages in order to encourage the deposit of fat and prevent aggressive behaviour problems. Moreover, specially in high life weight productions systems, it is also carried out to avoid the risk of obtaining meat with boar taint. 

The boar taint is and off-odour and flavour related to the presence of Androstenone and Skatole. These compounds, specially Androstenone, can be accumulated in the fat tissue of the entire male pigs.
Moreover, it is interesting to highlight that only those consumers genetically determined can smell it, and they may react differently. This means that some consumers simply can not smell it, others can smell it and like smell, and some others can smell it and do not like it, so that they can reject the meat.

Therefore, there is an associated meat quality problem related to the castration of pigs.

About 97.6 million pigs (79.3% of the total EU pig production) were CASTRATED in 2008 in the EU, 48.7% of which were surgically CASTRATED WITHOUT ANAESTHESIA
1. INTRODUCTION: Background
Castration can be LEGALLY performed without anaesthetics during the first SEVEN days after birth
After that should only be performed under
     ANAESTHESIA and must include a prolonged
    ANALGESIA by a VETERINARIAN

1. INTRODUCTION: Background

European Declaration on alternatives to 
surgical castration of pigs

The European Commission and representatives of European pig farmers, meat industry, traders, retailers, scientists and NGO’s committed themselves to plan to voluntarily end surgical castration of pigs in Europe by January 1st, 2018.
December 2010
There are some exceptions 
Social CONCERN for ANIMAL WELFARE has increased: castration     carried out without anesthesia could have  a NEGATIVE IMPACT.
The EU is considering banning castration without anesthesia by 2018 and promoting the raising of entire males.

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 


Many alternatives to AVOID CASTRATION have been explored
Genetic SELECTION and gender selection for ‘low-taint’ pigs
Different MANAGEMENT and rearing strategies 
Slaughter at a YOUNGER age and lower weight 
DETECTION of boar taint at slaughter line
MIXING of tainted with untainted meat 
MASKING unpleasant odours and flavours with the appropriate masking strategy such as spices, marinades or heat treatment.
If the castration is applied, the IMMUNOCASTRATION

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 


1. INTRODUCTION: Background
Focusing only on the ACCEPTANCE of the most effective masking strategy gives only a PARTIAL VIEW OF THE CONSUMERS’ PREFERENCES.
Liking or disliking a food product does not only depend on PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES but also on the consumers' EXPECTATIONS and attitudes toward EXTRINSIC cues.
The consumer FINAL CHOICE of a food product is a MIXTURE between the SENSORY EXPERIENCE (Intrinsic cues) and the other descriptors of the products  (Extrinsic cues).

Thus, the objective of this paper is threefold:
First, to analyze the CONSUMERS’ EXPECTED PREFERENCE toward a MASKING STRATEGY of frankfurter sausages.
Second, to study THE IMPACT OF THE SENSORY EXPERIENCE of this masking strategy on such preferences.
Third, to assess how the NON-OBSERVED HETEROGENEITY both at the SCALE AND MEAN PREFERENCES of the sausage’ attributes are AFFECTED BY THE EXPERIENCE in a REAL SHOPPING SCENARIO.

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
We applied TWO NON-HYPOTHETICAL DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENTS (DCE) by creating a REAL SHOPPING SCENARIO BEFORE and AFTER a HEDONIC SENSORY TEST for  frankfurter sausage.
To motivate the consumers in the RECRUITMENT process, they were REWARDED by €15.

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: Steps
First, participants were asked to answer in a SHORT QUESTIONNAIRE their ATTITUDES and CONSUMPTION behaviour towards pork meat and pork frankfurter sausage in particular. SOCIOECONOMIC and LIFE-STYLE variables were also collected

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: Steps
Second, participants were UNEXPECTEDLY REWARDED by an extra €5 and asked to select THEIR PREFERRED FRANKFURTER SAUSAGE from different choice sets built within the DCE design. Consumers were warned that their selection will have a consequence as a REAL MARKET WILL BE CREATED at the end of the experiment to exchange real money and real products.

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: Steps
Third, a HEDONIC EVALUATION test was carried out to assess the impact of the chosen masking strategy for boar taint and to CREATE A CURRENT SENSORY EXPERIENCE of the analysed product. Participants tasted FOUR DIFFERENT FRANKFURTER SAUSAGES with two different treatments: if the meat is obtained from CASTRATED pig or BOARS and if the FLAVOUR is ORIGINAL or with the masking strategy.

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: Steps
Fourth, consumers were INFORMED ABOUT WHICH TYPE of sausages they tasted in order to ASSOCIATE their sensory EXPERIENCE with the SPECIFIC products and characteristics. Then, the SAME DCE WAS REPEATED and consumers turned to reselect their preferred products from the same choice sets and asked to take into consideration their sensory experience.

Based on the literature and discussion groups we identified the following attributes and levels:
FLAVOUR: original and the masking strategy with spices and naturally smoked.
CASTRATION: meat obtained from castrated pigs or boars.
BRAND TYPE: manufacturer and private brands.
PRICE: €1.79, €1.39, €0.99, €0.59.
3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: The DCE: Attributes and levels



We consider ceteris paribus some attributes for all the offered alternative products (same package, same appearance, same sausage size, same format, same shelf life, same origin and same production method technology

We followed the DUAL RESPONSE CHOICE EXPERIMENT design.
From the FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN using the total number of attributes and levels which led to a total of 32 (23x41) hypothetical products. In a choice set of 4 alternatives we have (23x41)4 possible combinations.
The orthogonal fractional factorial design with only 8 CHOICE SETS.
Participants were also asked to perform an additional task (HOLD-OUT TASK) to conduct validity tests which is single-choice set with eight different sausages to those provided in the main task

3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: The DCE: Econometric model




The basic model is THE MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL (MNL). 



It imposes homogeneity in preferences for observed attribute
The IIA  property seldom hold.

“Consumer Behavior in a Changing World: Food, Culture, Society”. March 25 to 27, 2015. Naples, Italy

3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: The DCE: Econometric model
The Mixed Logit Model (MIXL)

Extend the MNL introducing for unobserved heterogeneity by allowing random coefficients on attributes .
Recent studies argued that much of the PREFERENCE HETEROGENEITY captured by random parameters in MIXL can be better captured by the scale term; and thus known as “SCALE HETEROGENEITY”.
The MIXL turns to be likely a POOR APPROXIMATION to stated data if scale heterogeneity is not accounted for

3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: The DCE: Econometric model
	The Generalized Multinomial Logit Model (GMNL)

Known also as Generalized Mixed Logit Model (G-MXL).
 n is a scaling factor that proportionately scales the  up or down for each individual n.
 is a mixing parameter, and its value determines the level of mixing or interaction between the scale heterogeneity coefficient and the parameter heterogeneity coefficient .

4. RESULTS: Sensory results
Creating the Sensory Experience
	Type of pork meat	Odour	Flavour	Overall acceptability
	Original sausage from boar meat	5.40c (1.43)	5.62c (1.56)	5.46c (1.61)
	Flavoured1 sausage from boar meat	6.51a (1.27)	6.36b (1.26)	6.42a (1.18)
	Original sausage from castrated meat	5.69b (1.19)	6.20b (1.33)	5.91b (1.30)
	Flavoured1 sausage from castrated meat	6.62ª (1.16)	6.69a (1.18)	6.62a (1.29)

The FLAVOURED SAUSAGE obtained from castrated and boar meat had the HIGHEST ACCEPTABILITY scores than the remaining type of sausage. This confirms that the APPLIED MASKING STRATEGY had a POSITIVE EFFECT on frankfurter sausage ACCEPTANCE.

Interpreting the tau parameter (KEY PARAMETER) that captures the SCALE HETEROGENEITY, results showed a substantial scale heterogeneity in the data in the pre sensory and a non-significant value in the post experiment.
After the sensory experience the VARIATION OF THE DEGREE of RANDOMNESS in their final decision and hence their degree of UNCERTAINTY DECREASED significantly.

Regarding the UNOBSERVED TASTE (PREFERENCE) HETEROGENEITY, it is captured by the standard deviation of the random parameters.
The estimated models showed STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS with the exception of the private brand in the pre sensory.

The main MOTIVATION OF THE G-MNL model is to SEPARATE the estimation of SCALE heterogeneity from TASTE heterogeneity, identified by the gamma parameter.
GAMMA in both model is RELATIVELY far from ZERO. Which implies that both heterogeneity tend to be INDEPENDENT. This INDEPENDENCE is emphasized in the POST EXPERIMENT. Gamma increased from 0.41 to 0.72 and thus both types of heterogeneity becomes MORE INDEPENDENTLY identified

5. CONCLUSIONS
The SENSORY EXPERIENCE for the different frankfurter sausages with the main identified STRATEGY of masking BOAR TAINT, have had impact ON BOTH THE SCALE AND PREFERENCE HETEROGENEITY by affecting the TAU and the GAMMA mixing estimates of the scale parameter.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The HEDONIC TEST DECREASED the degree of RANDOMNESS and UNCERTAINTY of consumers in their final election and the SOURCE of UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY obtained from the scale BECOME MORE INDEPENDENT than the taste preference.

5. CONCLUSIONS
These results HIGHLIGHT the IMPORTANCE of the DIRECT PROMOTION and the in situ MARKETING TECHNIQUES of these types of product in the retail point by GIVING POTENTIAL CONSUMERS THE OPPORTUNITY to test the product.

More studies ARE NEEDED to be done, especially to analyze the IMPACT of SENSORY experience on the attributes NON-ATTENDANCE and on the INTERNAL and EXTERNAL VALIDITY of choices
