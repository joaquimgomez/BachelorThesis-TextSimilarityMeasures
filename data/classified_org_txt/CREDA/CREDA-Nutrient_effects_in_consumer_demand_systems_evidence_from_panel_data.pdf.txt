Abstract 
 
This papers aims to analyse the demand for main food groups in Spain. Apart from the 
traditional economic factors (prices and income), our theoretical framework incorporates the 
nutrient composition of food into a demand model in the form of food attributes, as a proxy to 
take into account the rising consumer concern about the relationship between diet and health. 
A CBS functional form is chosen for the empirical model, which is estimated using a 
complete panel data set. Ten broad categories, nine nutrients and the most relevant socio-
economic variables have been considered. Finally, after employing an appropriate selection 
strategy, the chosen model is used to calculate expenditure, price and nutrient elasticities, as 
well as the main socio-demographic effects. Results indicate that the introduction of nutrient-
based determinants generates elasticities that differ from those obtained when only economic 
factors are included, particularly in the case of price elasticities. As the nutrients effect is 
incorporated in the model through adjusted prices, unhealthier food groups (cereals, white 
meat and eggs, dairy and sugar) become more inelastic as they are associated with higher 
perceived prices.

NUTRIENT EFFECTS IN CONSUMER DEMAND SYSTEMS: 
EVIDENCE FROM PANEL DATA 

 
  
 

1. INTRODUCTION 

A large body of scientific research has shown that diet plays an important role in 

determining the risk of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancer, stroke, 

diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis. Apparently, consumers are paying attention. Food 

consumption patterns are increasingly being driven by a much more complex set of 

consumer-perceived food nutrition factors than economists have traditionally incorporated in 

demand studies.  

Several studies based on time series data have already integrated certain types of 

health information indexes that are designed to measure the effect of consumer health 

concerns (Brown & Schrader, 1990; Capps & Schmits, 1991; Kinnucan et al., 1997; Chern & 

Kim, 1999; Ben Kaabia et al., 2001; and, Rickertsen et al., 2003). When using cross section 

data, previous literature has introduced health concern through the consideration of nutrient 

intake, using two main approaches. In the first, the effects of income and sociodemographic 

variables are measured on the demand for nutrients (Adrian & Daniel, 1976; Devaney & 

Fraker, 1989; Nayga, 1994; Ramezani, 1995; Subramanian & Deaton, 1996; or Chesher, 

1998, among others). In the second, an indirect two-step process is employed. First, a food 

demand system is estimated in order to calculate the effects of the relevant variables. Then, 

the effects of nutrient intake are measured by applying nutrient conversion factors to the 

resulting food effects (Xiao and Taylor, 1995; Ramezani et al., 1995; and Huang, 1999). 

However, we believe both approaches merely analyse the demand for nutrients instead 

of the demand for food. Since nutrients are not directly available in the market, the 

applicability of such results is limited. Hence, in this paper, we have incorporated the nutrient 

composition of food into a demand model in the form of food attributes. This enables us to 

measure quantitative changes in the demand for specific food products based on their 

nutritive attributes, rather than measuring nutrient demand in an isolated fashion. From the 

methodological point of view the consumer utility function is taken here to be a function of 



 

 

3

 

food attributes (where various nutrients form part of these attributes) and not a function of the 

goods themselves, following the consumer goods characteristics model approach introduced 

by Lancaster (1966, 1971). It is not unrealistic to assume that consumers are starting to think 

more in terms of food attributes than in terms of food products, while also taking into account 

prices and disposable income. The result is a demand function in which food quantities are 

considered as dependent variables, and income, prices and food attributes are the exogenous 

variables. Second, and with respect to our methodology, the CBS1 demand system proposed 

by Keller & Van Driel (1985) is used as the functional form. Finally, the specified model is 

estimated over a panel data set using information provided by the Spanish Continuous Survey 

of Family Budgets (Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares, ECPF). Only food 

consumed at home is considered2.  

The paper is structured as follows. We first present the evolution of the nutrient intake 

structure in Spain. Next, the theoretical foundations as well as the functional form of the 

model are developed. Then, Section 4 is devoted to the description of the panel data set. The 

econometric issues are outlined in Section 5, while in Section 6 our main results are 

presented. Finally, we draw our chief conclusions and indicate some interesting paths for 

extending the research on the role of nutrients in modern food demand.  

 

2. FOOD DEMAND STRUCTURE IN SPAIN 

So, what are Spaniards eating at home? We need this information to better understand 

the empirical results that follow. Table 1 shows the evolution of the nutrient intake structure 

from 1990 to 2002 for the various nutrients included in this paper (calories, carbohydrates, 

lipids, proteins, fibre, calcium, minerals, cholesterol and vitamins) and for the main food 

products. Two important observations on this data can be made. First, the relative importance 

of the different food groups in providing the different nutrients was quite stable over those 

twelve years. Second, as shown in the table, calories come mainly from cereals, potatoes and 

oils; carbohydrates come from cereals, potatoes and sugar; lipids from oils, dairy and red 

meat; proteins, from cereals, potatoes, dairy and meat; fibre intake comes from cereals, 

                                              
1 The name is taken from the institution in which they worked: the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics. 
2 The relative importance of Food-Away-From-Home (FAFH) expenditure has continuously increased during the last 
ten years, representing, in 2002, around 25% of total food expenditure in Spain (MAPA, several years). This relative 
importance substantially differs among food products, being especially important in the case of drinks (50%). 
However, the data set used in this study does not provide information on quantities consumed and prices. Only 
expenditure information is included, making unfeasible to incorporating FAFH consumption in our model.

potatoes, fruits and vegetables; calcium from dairy products; minerals, from cereals, potatoes 

and dairy products; cholesterol from eggs; and finally, vitamins are mainly coming from 

vegetables, dairy products and fruits.  

(Insert Table 1) 

We now explore possible differences in per capita nutrient intake introduced by four 

socio-economic scales. To this end, Table A1, in Appendix A, shows the evolution of nutrient 

intake at home per capita per day for the whole sample and for certain subgroups which 

reflect the main socio-economic characteristics of Spanish households: 1) the size of the town 

where the household lives; 2) the level of education of the head-of-household; 3) the age of 

the head-of-household; and 4) the composition of the household, measured by the percentage 

of members over 13 years of age. 

(Insert Table A1) 

Regarding population size, those living in the biggest cities (with more than 500,000 

inhabitants) consume less of all the nutrients. And in general, as the size of the town 

increases, residents consume less carbohydrates, fibre and minerals. The next scale shows 

that as the level of education of the head-of-household increases, the total intake of lipids, 

carbohydrates and cholesterol decreases. One might conclude that higher-educated consumers 

choose healthier food products. But this result could also be explained by the fact that the 

educated population segment eats out more than the general population, and Table A1 only 

includes food consumed at home. This also helps explain why homes headed by a person who 

has not completed primary school have the highest intake for all nutrients.  

 The third scale shows that when the head-of-household is over 25 years of age, the 

intake of all nutrients increases as their head-of-household gets older. Finally, the maximum 

nutrient intake is found for households whose members over 13 years of age comprise 

between 50% and 75% of the total.  

3. MODEL SPECIFICATION 

3.1 THEORETICAL MODEL 

Our theoretical approach starts by making the very plausible assumption that for more 

developed countries, consumer food choices are influenced by food attributes such as 



 

 

5

 

nutrients, taste, smell, appearance, etc3. The consumer goods characteristics model approach 

(Lancaster 1966, 1971) fits with this principal assumption. 

Let us now assume that the vector 
'

1( r..., )φ φ φ=  represents the levels of r attributes 

provided by the food products (nutrients, taste, smell, appearance, etc.). Of course, the 

components of φ  are not directly sold in the market but they must be obtained using 

different types of inputs. Then, let 
'

1( nq  q ..., )q=  represent the total set of food inputs 

available to the consumer, which can be bought in the market at prices
'

1( np  p ..., )p= . In 

this study, the vector φ represents the new argument of the consumer utility function.  

Households purchase market goods in quantities q with the purpose of jointly 

producing φ  which yields utility  U = U (φ ), where U ( ) is assumed to be strictly quasi-

concave. A linear relationship is assumed between φ  and q through the consumption 
technology matrix, A: 

Aqφ =       (1) 

where A =[ kja ] is an r × n matrix of known elements, and where the k
th row represents the 

amount of attribute k provided by one unit of each of the n food products. The jth column 

represents the amount of each of the r attributes provided by one unit of the jth product4.  

Finally, we must consider the consumer budget constraint:

p q  x
=

=∑                  (2) 

with x denoting total food expenditure.  

Summarizing, the consumer choice problem is represented by the following 

optimization problem: 

                                              
3 Evidently, as suggested by one referee, the relative importance of these attributes on food choice may differ 
significantly among consumer segments. 
4 While matrix A can easily be defined for nutrients, this is not the case for the rest of attributes. This is a potential 
limitation.

where λ denotes the Lagrangian multiplier. Solving the first order conditions derived from 

(4), the general form of the demand equations satisfying (3) is: 

qi = qi (p1, p2, ..., pn, 11a , …, 1ra ,…, 1na , ..., nra , x)   (5) 

A basic property of demand systems with attributes is that if the demand for any 

product increases as a result of a change in the demand for a particular attribute, the demand 

for the other products has to decrease, since total food consumer expenditures are constant. 

Following Barten (1977), it is important to note that, from a theoretical point of view, 

changes in jka  are only of interest in so far as they affect the first-order conditions derived 

from (4):

If the differentiation of the first-order condition with respect to jka  is multiplied by 

the Slutsky substitution effects matrix, the effect of attribute changes on consumption can be 

tied to the substitution effects of price changes as follows (Barten, 1977):

3.2 FUNCTIONAL FORM 

With these theoretical foundations, and a few of its implications derived, we now need 



 

 

8

 

to choose a functional form for the empirical model. From the logarithmic differential version 

of Equation (5), we get5:

If parameters θi and πij are assumed to be constant, the Rotterdam Model is obtained. 

However, there is no strong a priori reason for such restrictions. An alternative 

parameterization exists based on Working’s Engel model, xβα  w iii ln += , from which it 

is possible to derive the marginal budget shares, θ i , by multiplying by x  and then 

differentiating with respect to x :

or  θi= wi+βi      (10) 

Expression (10) implies that, under the Working’s model, the ith marginal budget share 

differs from the corresponding budget share by βi. Since the budget share is not constant with 

respect to income, neither is its associated marginal budget share. Substituting (10) in (9), we 

get the CBS model (Keller and van Driel, 1985) for the purpose of this paper:

Following Theil (1980) and Duffy (1987, 1989, 1990), we assume 

that γπ -  β jjkijijk =  and we let γ γ jkjjk = . The resulting demand system is given by:

where γ jk represents the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to attribute k in food j. 

In equation (12), γ jk will be non-negative if attributes increase consumer utility. In 

addition, the term

Note that, if 0>γ jk , then an increase in attribute k in food j decreases the price 

perceived by the consumer for food item j, which will probably increase the demand for this 

food item. Similarly, if 0<γ jk , then an increase in attribute k will increase the perceived 

price for the food item j and will probably decrease the demand for it. 

Finally, it is possible to include in (12), as in any other demand system, an intercept 

i α designed to represent changes in consumer taste. The final model, then, becomes:

demands that ππ jiij = . Finally, the negativity condition obliges 0≤ϖϖ'π  ∀ ϖ ≠0, 

indicating that the matrix π must be negative semi-definite and of rank n-1. The negativity 

condition implies that the eigenvalues of the π - matrix must all be non-positive. Since the 

rank of π is (n-1), the negative semi-definite condition requires the eigenvalues to be zero in

one case, and then contain (n-1) negative values. For our situation, the negativity condition 

cannot be tested statistically; however, the eigenvalues of the parameter matrix can be used to 

indicate whether this condition holds, on the average.

4. DATA AND PRELIMINARY TRANSFORMATIONS 

The data comes from the Spanish Continuous Survey of Family Budgets (Encuesta 

Continua de Presupuestos Familiares, ECPF), which is conducted by the Spanish National 

Office of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE). The ECPF is conducted every 

quarter with approximately 3,200 households participating. One eighth of the sample is 

renewed quarterly and hence an individual can be followed for a maximum of eight quarters 

(two consecutive years). Nevertheless, there is a significant percentage of households that do 

not complete all eight interviews (Browning & Collado, 1999). In this study, a complete 

panel data set has been constructed by “following” those households that remain in the 

sample from the first quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2002. Additionally, those 



 

 

11

 

households that report zero expenditure in all food groups or in all groups but one were 

dropped from the sample. As a result, we were able to collect information on expenditure and 

quantities consumed of different food products6 from a total of 217 households during 8 

quarters, which gives a total of 1,736 observations.  

Food products have been aggregated into ten broad groups: 1) cereals and potatoes; 2) 

red meat (beef and pork); 3) white meat (poultry) and eggs; 4) fish; 5) dairy products; 6) oils; 

7) fruits; 8) vegetables; 9) sugar and soft drinks; and 10) alcoholic beverages. This 

aggregation scheme groups together foods of similar nutrient composition.  

As regards food attributes, while it is possible to measure nutrient intake by applying 

conversion factors to the consumed quantities, it is impossible to measure the rest of the 

perceived food attributes such as taste, smell or appearance. Hence, to be consistent with 

previous literature7, we have assumed that differences in taste and in other non-observable 

attributes are mainly represented by differences in household characteristics, which will be 

included in the model using the intercept term. So, we are following the translating approach 

proposed in Pollak and Wales (1981) where the iα term in (13) is substituted by the 

following: 

*
isi i s

s
α   α  VSο= + ∑      (20) 

where VS represents the socio-economic characteristics that exert a significant effect on food 

demand. Four factors have turned out to be important: the size of the town where the household 

lives, both the level of education and the age of the head-of-household and, finally, the percentage 

of members over thirteen years old in the household. On the other hand, sex, the number of 

earners in the household and the type of household (single, couple, ...etc) have not found to be 

significant on the Spanish demand for food. 

Regarding nutrient content, jka  is defined as the average yearly nutritional content per 

unit of food consumed. This is calculated by dividing the total amount of nutrients by the 

                                              
6 Data on expenditure was available for all items within each food group or category. However, data on quantities was 
not available for all items. Within each group we were able to account for quantities that correspond to the following 
percentage of total expenditure for that group: cereals and potatoes, 58.63%; red meat, 52.51%; white meat and eggs, 
66.87%; fish, 60.52%; dairy, 72.56%; oils, 83.09%; fruits, 86.05%; vegetables, 69.24%; sugar, 100%; alcoholic 
beverages, 76.66%.  
7 See the discussion on this topic in Gao at al. (1997a).

quantity of food consumed. In this paper, the Andújar et al. (1983) nutrient conversion tables 

have been used to calculate these coefficients8. The following nutrients have been included: 
calories (kilocalories), carbohydrates (grams), lipids (grams), proteins (grams), fibre (grams), 

calcium (milligrams), others minerals (milligrams), cholesterol (grams) and vitamins 

(milligrams)9. 

Finally, since prices are not recorded, unit values for each group are calculated by 

dividing expenditures by quantities. These values may reflect not only spatial variations 

caused by supply shocks (i.e., transportation costs, cost of information, seasonal variations, 

etc.) but also differences in quality which can be attributed to brand loyalty or marketing 

services, among other factors (Cramer, 1973; Cox & Wohlgenant, 1986). For this reason, unit 

values must be adjusted before using them in the demand analysis (Cowling & Raynor, 1970; 

Deaton, 1988). Following Gao et al. (1997b), the quality-adjusted price is defined as the 

difference between the unit price and the expected price, given its specific quality-related 

characteristics10. The expected price is calculated by a hedonic price function such that:

s

 =  + +UV V   ϑ ι ε∑                                             (21) 

where UVj is the unit value and Vjs are the variables affecting the consumer choice of 

qualities, such as income and household characteristics, which are used as proxies for 

unobservable household preferences regarding the quality of the good. Regional and seasonal 

dummy variables have not been included because although they reflect systematic supply 

variations, their average effects are reflected by the intercept ϑj. Putting all this together, the 

quality-adjusted price is then:

8  Note that the jka  coefficients vary from household to household, since the composition of food products 
integrating each food group is different. For instance, although two households can consume the same quantity of 
fruits, nutrient content per unit of product, jka , can differ between them due to the different types of consumed fruits. 
9 We have calculated correlations among the different nutrient levels provided by each unit of food product. In all 
cases, correlation coefficients were lower than 0.6. Hence, we conclude that our choice of nutrients was appropriate.    
10 In those cases where unit values do not exist, as when households do not buy the specific product, these 
values have been estimated using a regression on the observed unit values of households which actually buy the 
product on dummy variables reflecting household characteristics such as region, season and income. The 
estimated parameters are then used to predict unit values for a specific household.

5. ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURE 

With the theoretical framework and available panel data set complete, it is time to 

determine the appropriate econometric specification of the model. For a panel data set, the 

CBS demand system is given by: 

*

1

ln ln ln
n

*
mtimt ij imtimiimt jti imt

j

( w d  ) d Q     d μ  βq pαw π υ
=

+= + + + +∑    (23) 

where wimt and qimt are the budget share and the quantity of good i (i=1, ..., n), for a household 

m (m=1, ..., M), at time t (t=1, ..., T); p jt
*  is the perceived price of good j at time t; 

μ im represents the household-specific effects, which can be modelled either as fixed 

(obtaining a fixed-effect model) or random (resulting in a random-effect model). Finally, the 

term υ imt  represents the conventional error term. In this paper, we have assumed a random 

effect model as the starting point, which we will retain if specification tests do not provide 

evidence in favour of the fixed effect model. Next, we will outline the estimation procedure.  

Under the assumption of random unobserved effects, the CBS model (23) must be 

carried out using a generalized least-squares estimator method due to the non-scalar nature of 

the covariance matrix of the error term ( imtimμ  υ+ ). Using μΣ  and υΣ  to represent the 

different equation covariance matrices related to the error terms μ  and υ , the covariance 

matrix for the complete model adopts the following form (Baltagi, 2001): 

   1 P QυΩ = Σ ⊗ +Σ ⊗      (24) 

where 1 T μ υΣ = Σ +Σ ; P is a matrix that averages the observations over time for each 

household; and Q is a matrix that obtains deviations from the household mean. 

Finally, the generalized least-squares estimator of δ is obtained by: 

   -1-1 -1ˆ ( ' ')GLS  Z Z  Z Yδ = Ω Ω     (25) 

where Y  is the vector of the endogenous variables, Z is the matrix of the exogenous variables 

and the inverse of the covariance matrix can be calculated as follows: 
1 1 1

1 P Qυ
− − −Ω = Σ ⊗ +Σ ⊗ . 



 

 

14

 

In order to obtain a feasible generalized least-squares estimator of δ, 1Σ  and υΣ  have 

to be estimated. We have used the procedure suggested by Wallace and Hussain (1969) 

which generates a consistent estimator of υΣ  while the estimator of μΣ  has a finite positive 

limit. Under such conditions, the feasible estimator (25) is asymptotically efficient (Prucha, 

1984).  

 

6. RESULTS 

As mentioned in the previous section, we started by estimating a system (23) 

assuming random unobserved household-specific effects11. Theoretical restrictions 

(homogeneity and symmetry) were imposed, and the adding-up restriction then required us to 

drop one equation from the system to avoid the covariance matrix singularity problem. In our 

case, the “alcoholic beverages” equation has been taken out12. Finally, the negativity 

condition was checked after estimation, observing the signs of the πij matrix eigenvalues. 

Since all the obtained values were non-positive, the condition is satisfied and, hence, it is not 

necessary to impose it. 

Additionally, according to the existing empirical literature, equation by equation 

misspecification tests related to the error terms have been carried out on the estimated model. 

More precisely, the null hypotheses of homoscedasticity and no autocorrelation of error terms 

were tested. As regards homoscedasticity, White test results show evidence of 

heteroscedaticity problem in two out of the nine equations. Therefore, the robust t-ratios 

proposed by White (1980) have been calculated for all equations. 

To detect any autocorrelation misspecification, the two types of statistics proposed by 

Bera et al. (2001) have been used. The first battery (RSμ) tests the existence of serial 

correlation under a random effects model, while the second (RSμρ) tests both the joint 

specification of a random effects model and that of no autocorrelation. Both statistics are 

                                              
11 The Times Series Processor (TSP) software has been used to make all the econometric work. 
12 The eliminated equation parameters are obtained from the adding up conditions. 



 

 

15

 

distributed as a χ2 with 1 and 2 degrees of freedom, respectively. The results obtained from 

both tests indicate that the null of no autocorrelation is never rejected13.  

While autocorrelation tests give us some statistical evidence in favour of the random 

effects model, the Hausman (1978) test has been used to corroborate this conclusion. As 

expected, the Hausman statistic was under the critical value (252.35 again a χ20.05 (237) = 

273.91). Hence, the null hypothesis could not be rejected and the random effect estimator is 

preferred over the fixed one.  

 Next, we tested for the presence of severe multicolinearity. The conditional value 

related to the correlation matrix of exogenous variables is 8.02, which is under the critical 

value of 25 (Novales, 1997). Hence, multicolinearity is not a severe problem in our system. 

 Finally, the system goodness-of-fit has been assessed by calculating the system 

 R2 proposed by Bewley & Young (1987). In our case, the system  R2 is 0.48, which is 

relatively high if one takes into account that the dependent variable is defined in first 

differences. Furthermore, to measure the explicative power of nutrients, the analogous 

measure was calculated from a model without nutrients. In this case, the  R2 takes on the 

value of 0.39, indicating that incorporating nutrient intake variables significantly increases 

the explicative power of the model.   

From the estimated parameters14, all elasticities (expenditure15, price and nutrient) are 

calculated. For comparison purposes, elasticities from the model without nutrients16 have also 

been calculated. Expenditure and uncompensated own-price elasticities, calculated at mean 

values, are shown in Table 2. All expenditure elasticities are positive and significant at the 

5% level of significance. Red meat, oils, fruits, vegetables and alcoholic drinks are luxury 

goods (when total food expenditure increases, the allocation for these products increases 

more than proportionally). Elasticities for white meat and eggs, and fish are close to unity 

                                              
13 The values obtained for the RSμ statistic for the 10 equations were: cereals and potatoes (0.72); red meat (1.04); 
white meat and eggs (1.61); fish (2.09); dairy (1.47); oils (0.70); fruits (0.95); vegetables (2.23); sugar (1.77); and 
alcoholic beverages (0.18): all of them are under the critical value at 5% significance of 3.84. The values obtained for 
the RSμρ statistic for the 10 equations were: cereals and potatoes (2.23); red meat (3.71); white meat and eggs (2.45); 
fish (3.12); dairy (2.92); oils (3.89); fruits (4.47); vegetables (3.27); sugar (2.68); and alcoholic beverages (3.17): all of 
them are under the critical value at 5% significance, which is 5.99. 
14 Not included, but available from authors. 
15 Since weak separability has been imposed, income elasticities have been calculated with respect to total food 
expenditure. 
16 That is, the random effects model associated with imposing in (22) the restrictions: *ln lnjt jtp   p j= ∀  



 

 

16

 

(0.90 and 0.93, respectively). These results are quite consistent with expectations. Perhaps, in 

the case of red meat, fish and dairy one would expect higher values because these products 

are typically high-priced. However, as mentioned in footnote 3, it is necessary to bear in mind 

that within each group, some of the most expensive products have not been included due to 

the lack of data. In fact, in the case of red meat, mutton is not included and, in the case of 

dairy, only fresh milk and sterilized milk are included, excluding high value-added products 

such as cheese and other dairies. For fish, only hake and whiting (fresh and frozen) have been 

included, both relatively low-price products. Finally, we observe that incorporating nutrient 

intake information slightly increases expenditure elasticities for the different food groups 

with the only exceptions being that of cereals and potatoes, white meat and eggs, fish and 

dairy. Nevertheless, the relative magnitude of elasticities for the different food groups does 

not change.  

(Insert Table 2) 

All uncompensated own-price elasticities are negative and significant. In general 

terms, the demand for the different products are quite inelastic; the most elastic products are 

fruits, cereals and potatoes, dairy and red meat. Comparison between these elasticities and 

those obtained from a model without nutrient attributes shows that, in most cases (cereals, 

white meat and eggs, dairy, fruits and sugar), the incorporation of nutrients into the 

specification of the demand system significantly reduces price elasticities. For the rest of the 

food groups, differences are not statistically significant, except in the case of fish where the 

price elasticity increases. Since the nutrients effect is incorporated in the model through 

adjusted prices that take into account the attribute composition of each food group (i.e. we are 

considering the perceived price for each food item), lower (higher) own-price elasticities are 

associated with higher (lower) perceived prices.  

Finally, food demand elasticities with respect to a change in nutrient composition, 

nutrient elasticities, have been calculated. Note that nutrient effects are perceived through 

food prices. In other words, given how the model has been specified, a positive elasticity 

means that an increase in the quantity of the i-th attribute per unit of the j-th food product 

decreases the price perceived by the consumer for food item j , which will consequently 

increase the demand for that food item. Own and cross-nutrient elasticities (similarly to price 

elasticities) have also been calculated. In fact, taking into account the properties of the 

theoretical model, an increase in the cholesterol level contained in white meat and eggs, for 



 

 

17

 

example, will have a double consequence: one on the quantities demanded for such products 

(own-effect) and another on the quantities demanded for the other products (cross-effect). 

Nevertheless, our main attention will be paid to own effects17. 

Own-nutrient elasticities for several products are considerably high (Table 3). 

However, the magnitude of such elasticities has to be interpreted with caution and it would be 

very risky to address a direct interpretation of the numeric values18. The reason for such high 

values is related to both model specification and data assumptions. In fact, as mentioned in 

footnote 8, as conversion factors are assumed to be constant for the different products, 

its variability comes from the different composition of food products integrating each 

food group. Obviously, if some food group is only composed by two o three products 

(i.e. white meat and eggs, dairy, oils and sugar), inter-household variability is 

relatively small. As the model is specified in first differences, the estimated 

parameters associated with such conversion factors (and the corresponding 

elasticities) are relatively high, as can be observed in Table 3. As a result, we are 

going to concentrate our interpretation on the sign and the significance of the obtained 

elasticities. 

The demand for cereals and potatoes is quite inelastic to various nutrient changes. 

That is, a per-unit change in the nutritive content of these foods does not produce an 

important change in demand for them. The only exception comes from the vitamin content, 

which exerts a negative effect on the demand for these two products. In the case of red meat 

and white meat and eggs, changes in calorie, lipid and the cholesterol content exert a 

significant and negative effect on the quantities demanded, while changes in protein content 

have a positive effect. Fish demand is positively affected by changes in carbohydrates, lipids, 

cholesterol, calcium and protein content while it is negatively affected by changes in calories 

and other mineral content. Dairy consumption is positively affected by changes in the vitamin 

content while negatively affected by changes in lipids, proteins and minerals. Oils are 

negatively affected by changes in the lipids content, while the effect of calories is positive. 

                                              
17 Intuitively, it should be an upper limit to nutrient intake. If this were true, any increase in the nutrient content of a 
product should decrease the demand for other products that incorporate that same nutrient. However, as food products 
can be eaten mixed in different combinations, it is difficult to set those upper limits. Hence, cross-elasticities can be 
positive or negative, but the interpretation will depend on the reader’s intuition. 
18 However, this limitation, in our opinion, does not invalidate the suggested approach as it can be easily overcome 
with a richer data set. 
 



 

 

18

 

For fruits and vegetables, Table 3 shows that the demand for such products is positively and 

strongly influenced by changes in the vitamin content. Finally, carbohydrates positively 

affect the demand for sugar, while calories have a negative effect.   

(Insert Table 3) 

In general terms, if we analyse Table 3 by rows (from a nutrient intake perspective), 

an increase in a specific nutrient increases the demand for those products that are the main 

providers of that specific nutrient (taking into account their respective conversion factors). If 

one single product is by far and away the main provider for a nutrient, a negative sign is 

likely to appear for the rest of the main food group providers of that nutrient. A good example 

is calories. As can be observed, an increase in calorie content increases the demand for oils, 

but reduces the demand for sugar and meat (taking into account Andújar et al. (1983), 100 

grams of oils generate 899 Kcal while 100 grams of sugar and meat generate less than 25% of 

oil Kcal - 206 and 232 Kcal, respectively). An increase in carbohydrate content increases the 

demand for sugar (by far the main provider) and an increase in protein content increases the 

demand for meat and fish. This pattern can also be observed for vitamins and calcium. 

However, the results for minerals, lipids and cholesterol are not very conclusive. In the case 

of cholesterol and lipids, results are almost identical; indicating that maybe only one nutrient 

should be considered. Moreover, it would have been useful to distinguish between “good” 

and “bad” fats but Andújar et al (1983) does not provide such information.    

 Finally, let us find out how food demand is affected by the main socio-demographic 

variables. The results are shown in Table 4. First, remember that the reference category is 

populated by households living in towns with less than 10,000 inhabitants, headed by a 18 to 

25-year-old person that has not completed primary school and, finally, with a percentage of 

members over thirteen years old that is less than 25%.   

(Insert Table 4) 

 We start by asking, what is the effect of the town size? Households living in the 

smallest towns (reference category) have the highest expenditures for red and white meat, 

dairy and other products, and the lowest for sugar. The highest expenditure share for cereals 

and potatoes corresponds to households living at the two extremes, the largest and the 

smallest towns. Allocations for fish and fruits are higher for households living in the middle 



 

 

19

 

size towns (from 10,001 to 500,000). Finally, note that the lowest oils and vegetables shares 

are for households living in towns between 50,001 and 500,000 inhabitants.  

 The level of education also plays an important role explaining differences in food 

consumption among Spanish households. Table 4 shows that, generally, as the level of 

education of the head-of-household increases, the cereals and potatoes expenditure share 

decreases. Also, households headed by a more-educated person (with at least secondary 

school under their belt) allocate higher expenditure shares for red meat, fish and other 

products, while spending less on white meat, dairy and vegetables.  

 Regarding the age of the head-of-household, the reference 18 to 26-year-old group 

has the highest expenditure shares for red meat, white meat and eggs, and for sugar, but the 

lowest for cereals and potatoes, dairy, oils, fruits and alcoholic beverages. The highest fish 

shares are for households headed by a person older than 46. Dining room tables of middle age 

heads-of-household (between 26 and 65 years old), have the smallest offering of vegetables.  

 Finally, we look at the effect of household composition, as measured by the 

percentage of members over thirteen years old. In general, as the household composition 

ages, we have an increase of red meat, fish, dairy and oils consumption, and a decrease of 

cereal and potatoes, white meat and eggs, fruits, vegetables and sugar.  

  

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

In most developed countries economic variables as food demand determinants are 

becoming less important while certain characteristics related to health issues are gaining in 

importance. Consumers have started to think more in terms of nutrients than in terms of the 

food products themselves (although, obviously, without ignoring the economic factors). In 

this paper we proposed a theoretical model based on the assumption that utility depends on 

food attributes (where nutrients are a subset of these attributes) instead of goods. From this 

theoretical model, we estimate a demand system that includes the nutritive content of food. 

While this type of analysis, as most of the empirical literature on food demand dealing with 

broad food groups and not with specific food products, may be limited interest for product 

development or agricultural marketing, our approach is able to provide more accurate food 



 

 

20

 

demand elasticities, which can be useful for policy analysis and general equilibrium 

modellers.  

Results obtained in this paper are quite consistent with previous expectations. 

Moreover, the introduction of nutritive content in the utility function generates some 

differences in food demand elasticities compared to a model in which only prices and income 

are considered. These differences are most evident in the price elasticities. In fact, the 

incorporation of nutrient composition, in most cases, increases the perceived price of a 

specific food product, thereby reducing price elasticities. In the case of expenditure elasticity, 

the opposite takes place, that is, elasticities are higher when nutrients are incorporated 

although only slight differences are observed in this case. The only exceptions to this are 

found for cereals and potatoes, white meat and eggs, fish and dairy. We therefore conclude 

that the nutritive content of food products mainly affects the consumer demand for food 

through changes in the perception of the relationship between each product’s quality and 

price. As mentioned above, this approach also has allowed us to calculate the nutrient 

elasticities. Our most fascinating result is this: specific food products that have been pegged 

in the mind of consumers as the principal source of a particular nutrient have their perceived 

value increased when they contain more of that nutrient. Meanwhile, competing, let us say 

"non traditional" sources of that same nutrient suffer the opposite effect.  

This promising approach to including nutrients as food attributes shows that further 

research is needed in several areas. From a methodological point of view, it would be great to 

know how sensitive these results are to the selection of the functional form of the demand 

system. Of course, any new competing model should include alternative or complementary 

variables that take into account for the increasing consumer concern about the relationship 

between food and health. From an empirical point of view, one should be able to select the 

most relevant nutrients from a balanced diet point of view, to differentiate between “positive” 

and “negative” nutrients by, for instance considering deviations from official health 

department recommendations, and, finally, to be able to work with more specific and 

homogeneous food groups: red meats, oils, etc.

Let us start by obtaining the logarithmic differential of Equation 5:

where ηi  is the income elasticity of demand for good i; μij are the uncompensated price 

elasticities; and  
a

∂
∂

is the elasticity of demand for good i with respect to attribute k for 

food item j. 

 

Taking into account that the Slutsky equation is also valid for the present approach, 

substituting in (A1) the term ijμ  with jiijij we ημ −= , we get:   

1 1 1 1

where the ije represent the compensated price elasticities. 

 

Next, multiplying both sides of (A2) by wi:  

1 1 1 1

Finally, using the result obtained in (8’), the logarithmic differential version of the
