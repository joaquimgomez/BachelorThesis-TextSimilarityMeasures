Abstract  

 

This paper analyses the impact of food safety information about the “mad-cow” crisis on 

the demand for different types of fresh meat and fish in Spain. The theoretical model explicitly 

incorporates food safety information in the consumers’ utility function, from which demand 

equations are obtained. Two alternative functional forms have been considered, the standard 

AIDS and the Generalized Almost ideal Demand System (GAIDS) in order to overcome the 

problem of incorporating demand shifters in the traditional AIDS model. The food safety 

information has been incorporated into the demand function through a weighted information 

index built on the basis of the published news related to the mad-cow disease in the most 

popular Spanish newspaper. The comparison of elasticities from both models suggests that 

GAIDS elasticities are more consistent with the characteristics of meat and fish markets in 

Spain. Moreover, mass media information on BSE has had a statistically significant but small 

effect on the consumption of the different meat products in Spain. 

 

Key words: meat consumption, food safety information, BSE, demand systems, GAIDS

1. Introduction  
 

Recent food scares, specially the discovery of Bovine Spongiform 

Encephalopathy (BSE), have increased consumers’ concerns on food safety, with 

significant reductions in the consumption of affected products. In Spain, the first 

Spanish BSE case was diagnosed on November 22, 2000, being the second one 

diagnosed two weeks later. Both cases took place in Galicia (North-West). Since then 

the number of confirmed cases has notably increased reaching its peak in 2003 with 167 

cases. The total number of confirmed cases in Spain from November 2000 to the end of 

2006 was 681; ranking fifth in the E.U. Up to now, the incidence in humans has been 

very limited. More precisely three cases have been confirmed. Beef consumption 

slightly decreased since 1994, having recovered in 1999 and 2000 (MAPA, 2004). 

However, this recovering process ended with the first case of BSE in Spain in October 

2000. Between 2000 and 2001, beef consumption decreased annually by 12%. 



 3 

However, in the very short-run the impact was substantially large (beef consumption 

decreased from 22 million Kg in October 2000, to 15.8 million Kg in December 2000).  

 

These figures suggest that, in addition to the traditional economic factors (income 

and prices), food safety concerns may have a potentially significant impact on 

consumers’ demand for meat. Angulo and Gil (2007), in a nation-wide survey, showed 

that, in Spain, 63% of respondents declared to be more concerned about food safety than 

five years ago. If only the problem per se is considered, this effect seems to be 

overestimated and some other factors have to be found to explain it. The most important 

is, without any doubt, the mass media coverage of recent food scares and their influence 

on consumers’ behavior. In the same study, 52% of respondents recognize that mass 

media exert a strong influence in their shopping and consumption habits. Therefore, 

understanding the consumers’ responses to food safety information is important to 

policy analysts and the agro-food industry. 

 

The objective of this study is to analyze food safety information effects on meat 

demand in Spain. More precisely, we will focus on the impact of the information on 

BSE published in newspapers on the demand for beef and other substitutes. Although 

there have been some recent studies on the impact of food safety information reported in 

the media as well as product claims on food demand, such as Verbeke and Ward (2001), 

Burton and Young (1996), Piggott and Marsh (2004), among others, this study is the 

first attempt to tackle with this issue in Spain.  

To achieve this objective, we have developed a theoretical model that explicitly 

incorporates food safety information in the consumers’ utility function and from which 

demand equations are obtained. As the appropriate functional form for such equations, 

and in order to overcome the problem of incorporating demand shifters in the traditional 



 4 

AIDS model (i.e. the model estimates of real variables are sensitive to the choice of 

scaling of the exogenous variable) (Alston et al. 2001) and to preserve the desirable 

theoretical property of being “closed under unit scaling” (CUUS), the Generalized 

Almost Ideal Demand System (GAIDS) has been adopted (Bollino 1987). Moreover, 

the instrument to incorporate the food safety information into the demand function has 

been the construction of a weighted information index based on the published news 

related to the “mad-cow” disease in the most popular Spanish newspaper “El País”. 

This paper is organized as follows. Next, the theoretical and the econometric 

frameworks are explained. After describing the data used in our analysis, the main 

results are presented. Finally the paper ends with some concluding remarks. 

 

 

2. Theoretical and econometric frameworks 

 

In the neoclassical economic theory, the consumer’s utility is specified as a 

function of quantities of goods and services purchased assuming that consumers have 

perfect information and that their tastes and preferences are constant, which is not 

always the case in the real world. In this context, incorporating food safety information 

in the derived demand function can be misleading as the demand itself is derived from 

assuming tastes and preferences as given. Following Piggott and Marsh (2004), 

consumer’s utility is assumed to depend on the quantities of goods consumed (
i

x ), as 

well as on product quality (
i

q ) which is a function of public information indexing food 

safety concerns related to a specific product. This public information may contain food 

recalls or other issues related to food safety issues (i.e. the BSE). It is also assumed a 

negative relationship between public information and perceived quality. 



 5 

Let us assume that we have n goods, one of which (i.e. good 1) is affected by a 

food scare and public information is available. Thus, the consumer’s optimization 

problem may be stated as: 

[ ]Max U = U x,q(I)
 

S.t. p X + I C y′ ≤
                                               (1) 

where: X  is n x 1 vector of quantities consumed. 

  q(I)  is n x 1 vector of expected qualities being I the set of public                                

information indexing food safety concerns. Larger values of I reflect lower expected 

quality of the i-th product, that is,   i

I

∂

∂
 j i∀ ≠ . 

 
p
 is a victor of prices. 

 C is the cost of searching information. 

 y is the total expenditure.  

 

As information is taken to be publicly available, costs of obtaining information is 

assumed to be zero. Thus equation (1) can be rewritten as 

 

[ ]Max U = U x,q(I)
 

                                                  
. . p x S t y′ ≤

                      (2) 

 

To solve this maximization problem we define the following Lagrange function: 

 

[ ]L=U x, q(I) + λ(y-p x)′     (3) 

 



 6 

where λ  is the Lagrange multiplier. By deriving (3) with respect toX  and λ , we get the 

first order conditions from which the Marshalian demand functions are obtained. 

 

m
X =f(p,y,q(i))          (4) 

 

where the demand of each product depends on total expenditure, prices and the quality 

of the product. 

The dual cost minimization problem is: 

                                    min ( ( , ))p x u U x qµ′ + −
            

                           (5) 

 

where µ  is the lagrange multiplier. The solution of this problem gives the Hicksian 

demand function. 

                                             
h

x =f(p,u,q)                                                   (6) 

Following Piggott and Marsh(2004) the Marshalian and Hicksian demands are 

used to determine the comparative statics of the consumer’s decisions for the impact of 

meat quality (measured implicitly by food safety information) on the demand for meat. 

The Marshalian effect on the demand for  
i

x  for a change in the quality of another 

good k, 
k

where 
j kx q

U is the marginal utility of good j with respect to a change in the quality of the 

good k. 

From this comparative statics we can conclude that: 

1- 
j kx q

U >0 if k=j because logically an increase in the product quality will result in an 

increase in its utility. 

2- 
j kx q

U >0 if k and j are net complements. 

3-

U <0 if k and j are substitutes.

with the opposite signs for the comparative statics for I

To capture the own and cross - commodity impacts on demand from safety 

concerns requires the specification of the demand system shown in (8). The Deaton and 

Muellbauer’s (1980) Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) has been widely used due to 

its desirable characteristics. In spite of the desirable characteristics of the AIDS, a great 

disadvantage of the use of AIDS model appears when we want to incorporate demand 

shifters like food safety information. Alston et al. (2001) indicate that the AIDS model 

estimates of real variables (such as market shares and elastisities) are sensitive to the 

choice of scaling of the exogenous variables when demand shifters are included (for 

instance, modifying the intercepts of the AIDS model). They show that the generalized 

version of the AIDS model (GAIDS), first developed by Bollino (1987), preserve the 

desirable theoretical property of being “closed under unit scaling” (CUUS).  

 

The starting point (Piggott and Marsh 2004) is the following generalized 

expenditure function: 

 

*
( , ) = p C + E ( , )E p u p u′

    (9) 

 

where p is an N-vector of prices, C is an N-vector of pre-committed quantities, and u is 

utility. These generalized expenditure function is decomposed into two parts: the pre-

committed expenditure p C′  and the supernumerary expenditure
*

E (p,u) .The pre-

committed expenditure represents the expenditure  to attain a minimal subsistence level 

while the supernumerary expenditure represents the remaining budget to be allocated 

among the competing products.

By applying Shephard´s lemma and making use of dual identities the quantity 

demanded of the i-th product (
i

x ) is given by:

c represents the pre-committed quantity of the i-th product; 
*

i
x represents the 

supernumerary quantity; p is an N-vector of prices;  M is total expenditure; and y* is the 

supernumerary expenditure. It is important to distinguish between the two components 

of consumption as economic variables like income and prices do not have any effect on 

the pre-committed quantities while these variables logically affect the supernumerary 

quantities. 

 

Under the AIDS model demand changes in response to non-price and non-income 

variables, such as food safety information, are incorporated by considering the
i

c ’s to be 

function of demand shifters. The potential demand shifters used in this study, as well as 

the specification of the pre-committed quantities, will be discussed in the results 

section.

3. Data 

 

The data set consists of the monthly per capita expenditure (€/capita) and retail 

level prices (€/Kg.) for five products: four fresh meat groups; beef, pork, lamb and 

chicken. Additionally fish consumption is included also. The sample period extends 

from January 1997 to September 2006. Data come from the Spanish Ministry of 

Environmental, Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM). As mentioned in the previous 

section, in this study we have included in the utility function the quantities consumed 

and the perceived quality. The latter element is a function of public information 

indexing food safety concerns (in our case, on BSE). Thus, the first task has been to 

build a food safety (BSE) information index. 

Several types of indices have previously been introduced for use in econometric 

demand analyses, ranging from dummy variables (Tansel, 1993), a news count (Smith 

et al., 1988) or cumulative sum of news (Brown and Schrader, 1990, among others), 

sometimes with discrimination between negative and positive messages and/or 

including some message or time weighting factor. 

In this study we have developed an information index based on the published 

news related to the mad-cow disease in the most popular Spanish newspaper “El País”.
1
 

To build the index, the first step has been to count the number of newspaper articles that 

matched the following key words: mad-cow, beef crisis, Bovine Spongiform 

Encephalopathy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease “CJD” (vacas locas, Crisis bovina, 

Encefalopatía espongiforme bovina ”EEB”, Enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob). The

 11 

average number of news was 20 per month with a standard deviation of 43.2 during the 

period from January 1996 to December 2006. The maximum number of news was 354 

in February 2001, while the minimum number of news was zero in January 1996. No 

discrimination between positive or negative messages was carried out because, as 

indicated by Mazzocchi (2006), such discrimination can be highly subjective. News has 

not been weighted taking into account for instance the size of the article. Although this 

can be a limitation, this weighting process can be also highly subjective.  

After counting the number of news, the second step has been to build the index. In 

doing so and taking in account the lagged and diminishing effect of information over 

time we have adopted the weighted information indices introduced by Chern and Zuo 

(1995) and Kim and Chern (1997). 

Results are shown in Figure 1
2
. As observed, the obtained weighted information 

indices from both the cubic weight functions and the geometrically declining weight 

function seem to be identical. The cubic weight function has been finally chosen as it 

seems to be slightly smoother than the other one. 

 

 

4. Results 

 

4.1. Weak separability. 

 

It is common, in food demand studies, to assume that goods which are closely 

related in consumption are weakly separable from other goods. In the case of Spain, 

several studies dealing with the demand for meat products (Angulo and Gil, 2006, 

among others) have concluded that fish is not weakly separable from meat. In this paper 

the test proposed by Hayes et al. (1990) has been applied to check for weak separability

 In each case, different lifespan, carryover periods and decaying rates have been used. Results did not 

significantly differ. 

 



 12 

between fish and meat products considered as a whole. The test statistic was 55.0, 

which was well over the critical value at the 5% level of significance (χ2 (3) = 7.81), 

indicating that the null hypothesis of weak separability is rejected, that is, fresh meat 

and fish can be considered an integrated food group. Following the same approach, the 

fresh meat and fish group can be considered weakly separable from the rest of food 

products, also considered as a whole. 

 

4.2. Misspecification tests 

 

Our specification strategy started by estimating a static AIDS dropping the 

chicken equation in order to avoid singularity. As it is well known, the system is 

invariant to which equation is deleted and the parameters of the dropped equation are 

derived from the adding up conditions.
3
 Multivariate and univariate tests for 

autocorrelation, normality and conditional heteroskedasticity (Doornik and Hansen, 

1994) have been carried out to check the statistical adequacy of the model before 

calculating the reduced rank tests. Results are shown in Table 1 (first column) and 

indicate that the model has serious misspecification problems. 

 

Non-normality is associated to excess kurtosis indicating that the static AIDS is 

not able to capture the changing behavior that took place between 2000 and 2001 as a 

consequence of the BSE. To tackle this issue, the cubic BSE information index shown 

in Figure 3 is introduced. Misspecification tests (Table 1, second column) again indicate 

that the model is not correctly specified. The introduction of seasonal dummy variables 

does not improve the performance of the model (Table 1, third column). Finally, a 

dynamic version of the model has been considered by introducing in each equation the 

twelve-period-lagged budget shares of the five products, in order to guarantee the 

                                                 
3
 All models in this study have been estimated imposing homogeneity and symmetry.

With the aim of overcoming the problem mentioned in section 3 of incorporating 

demand shifters into the AIDS model and to capture the effect of the non- economic 

variables like BSE information on meat and fish demand, maintaining the CUUS 

property, we have incorporated the demand shifters in the GAIDS model by making 

every pre-committed quantity as a linear function of these demand shifters:

 As an alternative, a diagonal adjustment was also considered, that is, by introducing in each equation 

only the twelve-period-lagged dependent variable and imposing the same parameter to all equations. 

Although autocorrelation problems were corrected, non normality problems remained in two equations.

However, the most important elasticity is the BSE information index elasticity. In 

the case of the AIDS model, such elasticity can be easily computed as i

However, in the case of the GAIDS model, the computation is not straightforward. 

Moreover, in the case of the information elasticity, it is important to distinguish between 

the direct effect, that measures the percentage change in the pre-committed quantity of 

the good as a result of a 1% change in the BSE information index and the total effect 

which measures the percentage change in total quantity. In other words, the total 

elasticity of BSE information index (
,i IN

ϕ ) equals the derivative of the logarithm of the 

total quantity with respect to the logarithm of the information index, which equals the 

weighted sum of the derivative of pre-committed (direct effect) and supernumerary 

quantities with respect to the BSE information index. Mathematically:

Table 3 shows the estimated conditional expenditure, own-price and BSE 

information elasticities from both the AIDS and the GAIDS models. As can be observed 

significant differences have been found when comparing both sets of elasticities, being 

more consistent those obtained by the GAIDS model. All expenditure elasticities are 

positive and statistically significant. Lamb, fish and beef are considered as luxury 

products in relation to total meat and fish expenditure while chicken and pork can be 

defined as a necessity. This is consistent with the fact that lamb and beef are the most 

expensive products. In the AIDS model the high expenditure elasticity for pork is 

somewhat surprising as well as the lowest value for fish. Results from previous studies 

for Spain are mixed although, in general terms, are closer to those obtained from the 



 18 

GAIDS. In any case, none of the existing studies has considered the period after the 

BSE crisis.

All own-price elasticities are negative and inelastic except in the case of lamb, 

which is slightly higher than unity. This is not a surprising result as in the case of lamb 

no many different qualities with different prices exist. Thus, changes in lamb prices can 

lead to significant variations in lamb consumption as consumers have limited choices 



 19 

within the lamb meat category. The same explanation can be given to the relatively low 

value of the fish own price elasticity. In this case, we have grouped a huge variety of 

fresh products ranging from low to very high prices. Thus, an increase (decrease) in fish 

prices can lead to a higher (lower) demand for lower quality fish, with total fish 

consumption remaining more or less stable. In both models, the beef own price 

elasticity is not significant indicating that non economic factors are relevant to explain 

beef consumption in Spain.

Regarding BSE information index elasticities and if we compare the two models 

(total elasticity in the case of the GAIDS), results are somewhat similar. Elasticities are 

relatively small but significant in all cases as the main effect of BSE crisis in Spain took 

place during 14 months. Signs and relative magnitudes are consistent with patterns 

shown in Figure 2. The impact on beef consumption is negative, while it is positive for 

the rest of products. The magnitude of the positive effect is higher in the case of lamb 

than in the other cases, as it was the fresh meat which benefited most from the reduction 

in beef consumption due to the BSE information spread on mass media. In the case of 

the GAIDS model, the direct effect is not significant.  

 

6. Concluding remarks 

 

This paper has focused on the effect of BSE information on the demand for fresh 

meat and fish in Spain. Obtained results suggest a number of points, first and consistent 

with previous literature; fresh fish should be incorporated in a meat demand system. 

Second, models have to be dynamized in order to overcome misspecification problems.

 In both models, if the BSE information index is eliminated from the system, the price elasticity for beef 

is found to be positive. As can be observed in Figures 2 and 3, just after the BSE crisis the demand for 

beef recovered in a period of increasing prices. This has to do with the marketing strategy followed by the 

sector, which was based on the idea of increasing prices as a signal of increasing safety controls. 



 20 

Moreover, seasonality has to be taken into account as well as the BSE information 

index. Third, results from the AIDS and the GAIDS models are somewhat different; 

being those obtained from the GAIDS model more consistent with the evolution of meat 

consumption in Spain during the last decade. Information on BSE provided by the mass 

media exerts a significant effect on the demand for fresh meat and fish. As expected, the 

effect is negative in the case of the meat affected for the food scare (beef), while the 

effect is positive in the other cases, mainly for lamb, the principal substitute of beef 

meat in terms of prices. 

 

Our results slightly differ from previous studies on meat demand in Spain, mainly 

because of the studied period. However, this is the first study on meat demand after the 

BSE crisis, thus providing policy-makers and meat industry new insights to understand 

the impacts of food safety events on meat consumption. In any case, more research is 

needed to incorporate food safety information affecting other meats to have a global 

picture of meat consumption behavior in Spain.
