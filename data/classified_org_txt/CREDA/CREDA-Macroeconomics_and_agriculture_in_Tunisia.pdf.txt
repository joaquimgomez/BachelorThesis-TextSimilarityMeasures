MACROECONOMICS AND AGRICULTURE IN TUNISIA 
 

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyse the impact of changes in the monetary policy and the exchange rate on 

agricultural supply, prices and exports. The methodology used is based on the multivariate 
cointegration approach. Ten variables are considered: interest and exchange rates, money supply, 
inflation, agricultural output and input prices, agricultural supply and exports, income and the rate of 
commercial openness. Sample period covers annual data from 1967 to 2002. Due to the short-sample 
period, two subsystems are considered. First, long-run relationships are identified in each subsystem. 
Second, both subsystems are merged in order to calculate the short-run dynamics. Results indicate that 
changes in macroeconomic variables have an effect on the agricultural sector but the reverse effect 
does not hold.  

Key words: Macroeconomic policy, agro-food sector, Tunisia, impulse-response functions 

JEL Classification: C32, N57, O31 

 

1. Introduction 
The ongoing globalisation process in the world economy is a big challenge for Tunisia, a country 

which has suffered a complex process of structural economic reforms. The Adjustment Structural 
Program implemented in 1986 generated a new environment of economic success. All sectors of 
economy started to recover and exports dramatically increased being one of the main contributors to 
economic development. As an example, in the last five years the Tunisian GDP increased at a 5.5% 
annual rate while inflation was maintained around 3.5 %. 

The agro-food sector in Tunisia plays an important role in Tunisian economy. It generates around 
14% of total GDP, employs 22% of total labour force and agro-food exports represent around 15% of total 
exports, although still depending to a great extent on weather conditions. Moreover, since 1986 the 
agricultural sector is undergoing a modernization process characterized by a progressive intensification 
and the use of technology. However, the agricultural production has not been able to meet the needs of an 
increasing population. In general, the Government favoured imports of raw materials and food, which 
have provoked a progressive deterioration of trade balance. The agricultural policy was, then, oriented 
into two directions: 1) to promote the production of agricultural products in which self-sufficiency was 
low, through the implementation of a subsidies program (food security); and 2) to encourage the 
production of food products in which Tunisia had traditionally had a competitive advantage (olive oil, 
fruits, vegetables, etc) to finance the agricultural trade deficit. 

In many cases, results from such policies were, to some extent, different from those expected as 
the effect of many macroeconomic variables (as a consequence of the Adjustment Structural Program) 
were not taken into account. Although not explicitly recognized, changes in the macroeconomic policy 
have become increasingly important for the agro-food sector, as Tunisian agriculture has become more 
capitalized and more dependent on international markets, thereby becoming more vulnerable to 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates and international growth rates. 

The aim of this paper is, precisely, to provide a methodological approach taking into account data 
limitations to explain the relationships between macroeconomic variables and the agricultural sector in 
Tunisia. Special attention is paid to the distinction between long-run structural relationships and short-
run dynamics. Up to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyse such relationships in Tunisia. 
The existing literature on Tunisia is quite descriptive focussing on the evolution of agricultural trade 
flows which are only explained by changes in the agricultural policy (Arfa, 1994; Allaya, 1995; and El 
Abassi, 1995, among others). 

Since the mid seventies, a number of theoretical and empirical studies have analysed the impact 
of macroeconomic variables on the relative performance of the agricultural sector (see In and Mount, 
1994, for a literature review on this topic). In the early studies, macroeconomic variables (income, 

 2



interest rate, exports,...) were introduced as purely exogenous in agricultural sector models. The paper 
by Schuh (1974) could be considered as the starting point of a second group of studies emphasizing 
the role of exchange rate in explaining agricultural variable fluctuations (Chambers and Just, 1979, 
1981; Longmire and Morey, 1983; and Batten and Belongia, 1986). However, these empirical 
investigations neglect not only the possible effect of exchange rate changes on other macroeconomic 
variables (which can influence agricultural prices and exports indirectly) but also the effects of other 
macroeconomic variables (such as interest rates) both on exchange rate and agricultural variables. In 
this context, Chambers (1984) develops a general equilibrium model in order to analyse the effect of 
macroeconomic variables on agricultural trade where the exchange rate, income, interest rate as well 
as usual agricultural variables are treated as endogenous.  

Finally, it is possible to identify a third group of papers dealing with the analysis of the dynamic 
linkages between monetary variables and the agricultural sector. The question of money neutrality in 
the agricultural sector, and the speed of price adjustments, has been considered of central importance 
for policy analysis (Bessler and Babula, 1987; Devadoss and Meyers, 1987; Taylor and Spriggs, 1989; 
Larue and Babula, 1994; Dorfman and Lastrapes, 1996, among others).  

Results from most of the above-mentioned studies substantially differ from each other, and, in 
many cases, they are even contradictory. There exist alternative explanations for such differences: 
samples are not homogeneous, the number of variables included differs as well as their treatment as 
endogenous or exogenous, and the different methodological approaches used. However, there seems to 
exist a consensus on the fact that models analysing macroeconomic linkages to the agricultural sector 
should include the more relevant macroeconomic variables of the country being analysed and should 
treat them as endogenous (Devadoss et al., 1987; Taylor and Spriggs, 1989; Denbaly and Torgerson, 
1991; Thraen et al., 1992; In and Mount, 1994; Ben Kaabia and Gil, 2000; among others). Partly for 
this reason, most of the analyses on this topic have recently been conducted using Vector 
Autoregression (VAR) models. This is also the methodological approach we have followed in this 
paper although adapted to take into account data limitations and their stochastic properties.  

The paper is organized as follows. The data used in this study, their stochastic characteristics as 
well as the methodological approach are presented in Section 2. Long-run equilibrium relationships 
are analysed in section 3. The short-run dynamics is considered in section 4. Finally, some concluding 
remarks are outlined. 

 

2. Data and methodological approach 
Since the Sims’ (1986) seminal paper, VAR models have been one of the most widely used 

analysis tools to analyse the dynamic relationships between macroeconomic and agricultural variables. 
In VAR models, all variables are considered endogenous and no zero/one restrictions are imposed on 
the variables in the system. However, recent developments in time series analysis have modified the 
econometric framework for analysing such relationships. The concepts of non-stationarity and 
cointegration have become very popular and have to be explicitly tested to properly specify an 
econometric model. In this new context, Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990, 1992 and 
1994) provide an interesting methodology that allows the researcher to distinguish between the short 
and the long run. On the one hand, it is possible to identify the long-run structural relationships among 
a set of variables and how variables in the system adjust to deviations from such long-run equilibrium 
relationships. On the other hand, it is possible to calculate the impulse response functions in a similar 
way to that in the VAR models. This distinction is useful as economic restrictions are considered to be 
long-run in nature while it is also interesting, for the policy analysis, to know how the system adjusts 
to disequilibrium. 

In this paper we have followed this methodological approach although we have introduced some 
modifications in order to adapt it to data limitations. Availability of data is a major problem for 
economic modelling in Tunisia. It is difficult to find a large enough sample period for many economic 
variables. In this study 10 variables have been considered which collect the most important 
information in relation to macroeconomic variables and the agricultural sector (see the Appendix for 

 3



data sources and units of measurement): 1) Real Exchange rate (ER), defined as national currency 
(TND) per US dollar taking into account both the US and Tunisian consumer price indices; 2) Real 
money supply (M) (money supply (M2) divided by the consumer price index); 3) Interest rate (R), 
defined as the one-year money market interest rate; 4) Inflation (P) expressed as the Consumer Price 
Index in first differences; 5) Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP); 6) Real farm output prices (PP), 
calculated as nominal farm output prices divided by the Consumer Price Index); 7) Real farm input 
prices (IP)1, calculated as nominal farm input prices divided by the Consumer Price Index); 8) Real 
agricultural exports (AX), calculated as the nominal exports value divided by the consumer price 
index); 9) Agricultural output (AP), calculated as the value of the Tunisian Agricultural Output 
divided by the Consumer price Index; and 10) Rate of commercial openness (RCO) calculated by 
dividing the international trade flows (imports + exports) by the GDP. This variable provides an 
indication on how the Tunisian economy is inserted in the world trade. 

All variables are in logarithms, except for the interest rate and the inflation, which are in a 
percentage form and are divided by one hundred to make the estimated coefficients comparable with 
logarithmic changes. The sample period covers annual data from 1967 to 2002. Time series univariate 
properties have been examined by using unit root tests. As in small samples such tests have limited 
power (Blough, 1992), two alternative unit root tests developed by Elliot et al., (1996) and Ng and 
Perron (2001) as well as the stationary test from Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) (KPSS) have been applied. 
All tests indicated that all variables were I(1)2 

Taking into account the number of variables, the number of observations available for each 
variable and that all variables are I(1), the methodological approach followed in this paper consist of 
the following steps: 

i) The ten-variable system is divided into two subsystems. The first one has been defined by 
including: the real money supply, the inflation, the GDP, the farm input and output prices and the 
interest rate. Furthermore, taking into account the characteristics of the Tunisian economy, we 
have considered the interest rate as purely exogenous. The second subsystem includes the 
following seven variables: the farm input and output prices, the agricultural exports, the 
agricultural production, the exchange rate, the interest rate and the rate of commercial openness. 
Within this subsystem also the interest rate as well as the rate of commercial openness are defined 
as purely exogenous3. 

ii) Under the assumption of exogeneity for certain variables, the multivariate cointegration 
procedure developed by Pesaran et al. (2000) is used to test for cointegration in both subsystems. 
Moreover, cointegration vectors are identified as long-run meaningful economic relationships.  

iii) Merging results from the two subsystems into a single system with the original 10 variables, 
impulse response functions are computed to analyse short-run dynamics and to test the 
exogeneity assumptions made in the first step.  

 

3. Long-run analysis 

3.1. Model specification and cointegration rank 
All variables in each subsystem were I(1) and, then, a Vector Error Correction Model has been 

specified for each subsystem. The methodology developed by Pesaran et al. (2000) is used to 
determine the cointegration rank. These authors modified the Johansen (1988) procedure to explicitly 
allow for the introduction of exogenous variables. The base-line econometric specification for 
multivariate cointegration is a VAR(p) representation of a k-dimensional time series vector Yt 
reparametrized as a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM):

mentioned variables.

parameters (i=1,...,p-1), where p is the number of lags; Π is a (k×k) matrix of long-run parameters and 
et is the vector of disturbances niid(0,Σ). 

When exogenous variables are considered the vector Yt vector can be partitioned as Yt = (Zt,’, Xt 
‘)’, where Zt, is a (mx1) vector of endogenous variables and Xt is a (nx1) vector of exogenous 
variables (n=k-m), which can be considered as the “long-run forcing” variables in the system, that is, 
changes in Xt  have a direct influence on the variables Zt, while they are not affected either by the 
changes in the equilibrium relationships nor by past changes in Zt. This is equivalent to the notion that 
the set of variables Zt do not Granger-cause Xt.. According to the mentioned partition the error term et 
can be decomposed as follows:

If variables in Xt are not cointegrated, that is, 0x =Π  (and, then, zx,zz Π=Π ), Pesaran et al.. 
(2000) show that the k-variable system defined in (1) can be decomposed in the following two

4 Under such decomposition, variables in Xt are assumed to be weakly exogenous with respect to the cointegration 
space. Moreover, if variables in Zt don not Grange-cause Xt, then such variables are assumed to be strongly 
exogenous with respect to such cointegration space, that is, they would be only explained by their own past in the 
marginal subsystem.

Taking into account equations (5) and (6), to test for cointegration is equivalent to test for the 
Rank (r) of the matrix Πz:  

[ ] rRank :H zr =Π   r=0, ..., m  (7) 
To test for the number of cointegrating vectors (r), Pesaran et al., (2000), following Johansen 

(1988), proposed two statistics: the trace statistic and the λmax statistic. If the hypothesis of 
cointegration is not rejected (0<r<m), Yt is said to be cointegrated in the sense that there exists a kxr 
matrix β such that (β'Yt-1) is stationary and, consequently, the cointegration relationships can be can 
formally expressed as Πz=αzβ’. This procedure has been applied to the two subsystems described in 
the last section. Both subsystems are estimated including two lags5 and a constant restricted to the 
cointegration space6. Multivariate tests for autocorrelation (Godfrey, 1988) and normality (Doornik 
and Hansen, 1994) have been carried out to check for model statistical adequacy before applying the 
reduced rank tests. Results indicated that both subsystems could be considered correctly specified7. 

Table 1 shows the results from cointegration tests in both subsystems. As can be observed, for the 
first subsystem (upper part of Table 1) results from the λ-max and the trace tests indicate that there 
exist two cointegration vectors among the six variables includes while for the second subsystem 
(lower part of Table 1) results differ depending on the level of significance (two and three 
cointegration vectors for 5 and 10% levels of significance, respectively).

Taking into account the relatively large dimension of the VECM and the small sample available, 
the outcome of the test procedure has to be interpreted with some caution. Several simulation studies 
show (Abadir et al., 1999; Gredenhoff and Jacobson, 2001; and Johansen and Juselius, 2000) that the 
asymptotic critical values may not be very close approximations in small samples. For that reason, we

respectively, which were well below the critical value at the 5% level of significance ( χ ).

have also studied the roots of the companion matrix and the t-ratios of the αz parameters from the last 
cointegration vector (Juselius, 1995). For both subsystems, all the roots were inside the unit circle, 
indicating that all variables were I(1). Moreover, the eigenvalues of the companion matrix show that, 
for both subsystems, the first four roots were close to unity while the rest were quite small. In other 
words, we could not reject the null of two and three cointegrating vectors for the first and the second 
subsystems, respectively. Finally, all t-ratios of the αz parameters of the third cointegration vector for 
the first subsystem were not significant, while in the second subsystem, some of them were 
significant8. Thus, the first subsystem has been specified with two cointegrating vectors, whereas three 
cointegration vectors have been chosen for the second one.9  

3.2 Long-run structural relationships 

Identifying economically interpretable relations is the primary aim of this analysis. However, 
Juselius (1994) argues "the interpretation of the unrestricted cointegration space is far from 
straightforward when there are more than one cointegrating vector". Moreover, Johansen and Juselius 
(1994) suggest that only sometimes the unrestricted cointegrating vectors, surprisingly, can be directly 
interpreted in terms of theoretical economic relationships. Thus, some restrictions are needed in order 
to obtain a structural representation of such relationships.   

First subsystem 

Taking into account the variables included in the model as well as the economic theory which 
relates those variables, the following hypothetical cointegration relations could be expected:  

i) A money demand equation in real terms in which the monetary aggregate is related to the 
inflation in Tunisia, the Gross Domestic Product and an opportunity cost represented by the interest 
rate:

It is expected that βGDP>0; βR <0 and βP<0. If βGDP=1 Equation (8) would be consistent with the 
Quantity Theory of Money, wheras βP= 0 would exclude inflation to play a role in the demand for 
money in Tunisia.

In this paper, a two-step procedure is going to be used in order to check if (10) is supported by 
data. In the first step, each single restricted relation (8)-(9) is tested for stationarity leaving the other 
relations unrestricted. In other words, if restrictions imposed are compatible with a stationary 
relationship. The second step involves jointly considering the full identification of the two 
relationships. Juselius (1998) points out that this approach maximizes the chance of finding a correct 
full identification of long-run relations.  

Hypotheses related to the first step adopt the general form H0i: β=(Hiϕ,ω)10. In such an 
expression, restrictions to be tested are only placed in a single cointegration vector while the

9 The unrestricted cointegration space is not presented due to space limitations. Test carried out on the long-run 
parameters in β indicated that all of them were significant.

remaining (r-1) vectors are considered unrestricted. Johansen and Juselius (1992) suggest that this test 
can be used when we wish to test if there exists some vector in the cointegration space that linearly 
combines the variables in a particular hypothesized stationary relationship. Several hypotheses have 
been considered and tested. The specification of such hypotheses, as well as main results found are 
shown in Table 2. With respect to the first relationship, three different hypotheses have been tested. In 
the first one ( ), it is tested that real money is cointegrated with interest rate, GDP and inflation, 
imposing also income homogeneity. Results from the Likelihood Ratio (LR) statistic indicate that the 
null cannot be rejected

11. In the second hypothesis ( ), an additional restriction is considered 
(β =0). This hypothesis is strongly rejected, which means that the monetary authority is not fixing the 
monetary policy taking into account an aggregate money stock. The third hypothesis ( ) is similar 
to the first one but excluding the income homogeneity. Also in this case, we fail to reject the null 
hypothesis. Finally, in relation to the second relationship, hypothesis ( ) tests for price 
homogeneity in the agricultural sector. The LR statistic is under the critical value suggesting that 
monetary policy has a neutral effect on the real food-based prices. This means that, in the long run, 
input prices and output prices react in the same way and magnitude to changes in money supply.

Once it has been checked that each single equation is a cointegrated relationship, the second step 
consists of testing a full identification of the structural long-run relationships following Johansen and 
Juselius (1994). Taking into account results showed in the upper part of the Table 2, two hypotheses 
have been tested. The first one ( ) jointly tests the hypotheses and , whereas the second 
tests the hypotheses and . Only in the second case we fail to reject the null hypothesis (the 
LR statistic is 11.55, which is well under the critical value at the 1% level of significance (χ

that agricultural prices satisfy the homogeneity condition.  

Second subsystem 

In the second subsystem, taking into account the variables included and results obtained in the 
first one in relation to the agricultural prices, the following hypothetical cointegration relations could 
be expected:  

i) As the agricultural prices are also included in the second subsystem, and in order to check for 
data consistency, the first cointegration relationship would attempt to relate agricultural prices under 
the homogeneity restriction:

11 Several authors such as Reimers (1992) and Abadir et al. (1999) pointed out the tendency of likelihood ratio 
tests to over-reject in small samples when testing for the cointegration rank. Garratt et al. (1999) undertook a 
bootstrapping exercise to obtain critical values for testing the over-identification restrictions. The resulting 
critical values were higher than the asymptotic ones. This result would imply that the over-identification 
restrictions tested here are not rejected with higher p-values.

In order to test restrictions on the cointegration space, a similar approach to that mentioned for 
the first subsystem has been followed. However, in this case, as there are three cointegration vectors, 
one further step has been included. As a first step, we have carried out some tests on each individual 
long-run relationship leaving the rest unrestricted. The first hypothesis ( ), as mentioned above, 
only tries to guarantee consistency of data used. Thus, we have tested if agricultural prices 
homogeneity is stationary. Results from the LR test indicate that the null cannot be rejected, the same 
results as in the first subsystem. Three alternative hypotheses have been defined for the agricultural 
exports equation. The first one ( H ), tests for a stationary relationship among agricultural exports, 
farm output prices and the exchange rate and the rate of commercial openness. The second one (  
excludes the rate of commercial openness and includes the agricultural supply. Finally, the third one 
( ) excludes the rate of commercial openness without including any other variable. Results from 
the LR tests indicate that only the two first hypotheses are supported by the data. Finally, in relation to 
the agricultural supply equation, two alternative hypotheses have been considered. In the first one 
( ) agricultural output is defined as a function of farm input prices, the interst rate and the rate of

commercial openness. In the second one ( H ) the last variable is excluded from the equation. In this 
case, only the first hypothesis is supported by the data.

As a second step in the identification process of the long-run relationships, we have tested 
restrictions on two cointegration vectors taking into account the results obtained above. Thus, three 
further hypotheses have been tested. In all of them, we have maintained the price homogeneity 
restriction. The first one ( ) jointly tests  and , whereas the second one ( ) tests 

 and  and, finally, the hypothesis  jointly tests H  and . Results are shown in 
the middle part of Table 3. As can be observed, we fail to reject hypotheses  and  
indicating that we have a potential identification for the three-equation cointegration space. At the 
bottom of Table 3, results from jointly testing the hypotheses  H  and  are shown. The 
null cannot be rejected, indicating that the cointegrating space is identified.

Finally, Table 4 shows the estimated parameters of the β and αz matrices corresponding to the 
two subsystems. In the first case, the two cointegrating vectors have been normalised by the real 
money supply and the farm out prices. In the second subsystem, the three cointegrating vectors have 
been normalised by the farm output prices, the agricultural exports and the agricultural supply, 
respectively. All coefficients are statistically significant and have the expected theoretical signs. The 
only exception is the positive sign of inflation in the money demand equation. This result, following 
Sriram (1999) would indicate that in Tunisia an expectation of increasing inflation would determine 
economic agents to accumulate money stock to increase nominal income. It is also interesting the sign 
associated to the rate of commercial openness in the agricultural export and production equations. In 
the first case the sign is positive as expected. In the second equation the sign is negative suggesting 
that a higher rate of commercial openness would generate increasing imports of food products in 
which Tunisia has not competitive advantages (cereals, beef, vegetable oils, etc.), negatively affecting 
domestic production.  

The magnitude of coefficients cannot be interpreted as Juselius (1999) points out that "it is no 
longer possible to interpret a coefficient in a cointegrating relation as in conventional regression 
context....In multivariate cointegration analysis all variables are stochastic and a shock to one variable 
is transmitted to all variables via dynamics of the system until the system has found its new 
equilibrium position". On the other hand, in this type of analysis it is also convenient to consider the 
estimated (i indicates the row and j the column) parameters as they provide valuable information 
about the speed of adjustment of each variable towards the long-run equilibrium. As the relationships 
between macroeconomic variables and the agricultural sector are of interest for this study, let us focus 
on such relationships. 

z
j,iα

In relation to the first subsystem, and only considering the money demand and the price 
equations, the first conclusion is that there seems to exist a feedback relationship between 
macroeconomic variables and the agricultural sector. In fact, any shock in the money demand 
generates a response of input and output prices. On the other hand, any change in the long-run 
relationship between agricultural prices affects both the income (Gross Domestic Product) and the 
inflation. In relation to the price transmission mechanism, although in the long-run homogeneity holds, 
in the short-run the situation looks different. The αz parameters corresponding to the first cointegrating 
relationship indicate that input prices react quicker than output prices. This result suggests a cost-push 
transmission mechanism within the Tunisian agricultural sector, which is also confirmed when 
observing results from the second subsystem as α21 > α11, α22 > α12 and  α23 > α13).  

In the short run there seems not to exist a close relationship between agricultural supply and 
exports (the α42 and α33 parameters are not significant). This result would indicate that, in Tunisia, 
agricultural exports depend more on other factors rather than on the agricultural production as, for 
example, the commercial agreements (most of the exported food products are addressed to the 
European Union and are subject to contingents) or decisions made by existing exporters lobbies in the 
most important exporting goods (olive oil, dates, citrus, etc.). In other words, agricultural policy is 
more oriented to support agricultural prices and producers and consumers income than to incentive

trade competitiveness. Moreover the parameter α31 is not significant, indicating that there is not any 
significant relationship between farm output prices and agricultural exports, which reinforces the idea 
of dissociation between agricultural exports and supply.

However, simple considering the magnitude of adjustments to long-run relationships is not 
enough. It is also important to look at the time path of the reactions. The impulse response functions 
provide relevant evidence. They are analysed in the next section.

4. Short-run dynamics  
Once the VECM has been estimated, short-run dynamics can be examined by considering the 

impulse response functions (IRF). These functions show the response of each variable in the system to 
a shock in any of the other variables. The IRF are calculated from the Moving Average Representation 
of the VECM (see Lütkepohl, 1993 and Pesaran and Shin, 1998):

where matrices Bi (i=2,…,n) are recursively calculated using the following expression: 

pnk2n21n1n B...BB −−− Φ++Φ+Φ=Β ;B0=Ip;Bn=0 for n<0; 11 I Γ+Π+=Φ ; and Φ  
(i=2,…,p). Following Pesaran and Shin (1998) the scaled Generalized Impulse Response Functions 
(GIRF) of variable Y

where els(s=i, j) is the  sth column of the identity matrix. 

The GIRF are unique and do not require the prior orthogonalisation of the shocks (reordering of 
the variables in the system). On the other hand, the GIRF and the orthogonalised IRF (Cholesky) 
coincide if the covariance matrix, Σ, is diagonal and j=1. Standard deviations of impulse responses are 
obtained following Pesaran and Shin (1998). 

To analyse the short-run dynamics, as mentioned in section 2, we have first integrated the 10 
variables in a full system including all restrictions on the long-run parameters shown in the previous 
table. As the price transmission long-run relationship was specified in the two subsystems, only four 
cointegration relationships were defined. Moreover, when defining the full system two additional tests 
were carried out. The first one was to check if the variables we considered as purely exogenous (R and 
RCO) they actually were In this case, we have assumed that both variables followed a univariate

autoregressive process (i.e. they are not influenced by past values of the other variables in the system) 
and we have tested for the significance of the appropriate Γi parameters corresponding to such 
equations. The value of the statistic was 31,02, which was under the critical value ( ) at the 
1% level of significance). Second, all adjustment coefficients (α

41.33217 =χ
z parameters), which were non-

significant in Tables 3 and 4, were restricted to zero. The test indicated that the null was not possible 
to be rejected (the LR statistic was 58.92 which was under the critical value of a χ2(43)=66.95, at the 
1% significance level). The final estimated model is given by:

As 100 impulse-response functions are obtained, we will analyse only the estimated impulse 
responses of agricultural variables to a shock in the main variables in the system. Significant responses are 
marked with a circle. In general terms, most of the responses are not significant although they show the 
expected signs. In any case, as we have annual data, we cannot expect responses longer than one or 
two years. Figure 1 shows the responses to a shock in the real quantity of money, (through an 
unexpected increase in the nominal quantity of money). As expected, an expansive monetary policy 
affects positively to inflation, although the effect is only significant during the second year after the 
shock. Moreover, the increasing access to credits stimulates economic growth (the GDP increase) as 
well as agricultural exports. The effect on farm output prices is positive but non significant. The aim 
of the Tunisian agricultural policy is to support farmers’ income through intervention prices, but 
compatible with inflation control. Agricultural prices are not allowed to increase over expected 
inflation in order to guarantee consumers’ access to basic foods. Limited increases of agricultural 
prices do not stimulate agricultural production neither the demand for inputs. As a result, the impact 
on input prices is not significant. Finally, following the Keynesian theory, an expansive monetary 
policy induces exchange rate depreciation, which, on the other hand, leads to an increase of 
agricultural exports.  

Figure 2 shows the responses to a shock in farm ouput prices to the most relevant variables within 
the system. In general terms, agricultural variables do not have any effect on macroeconomic variables 
and, then, such effects are not included in the Figure. Two main results are found. First, a positive 
increase of producer prices generates a positive response of agricultural production. The response is 
significant for two years. Second, it also generates an immediate response of input prices. The 
magnitude of such a response is higher than in the case of output prices, which is consistent with 
comments in section 3 about the αz parameters. The effect on inflation is positive but not significant. 
As mentioned above, the government has traditionally controlled agricultural price increases to be 
compatible with the inflation rate in Tunisia. Finally, the effect on agricultural exports is not 

 13



significant either. Prices are not the main source of competitiveness for Tunisian agricultural exports 
as they are mainly subject to contingents. Moreover, the traditional policy used by the Tunisian 
Government to promote exports has been via exchange rate.

Responses to a shock in the farm input price are shown in Figure 3. Some interesting results are 
found. The first one is that responses of farm output prices are of lower magnitude than those of input 
prices. Moreover, the response of output prices is only significant two years after the initial shock. It 
seems that public authorities increases intervention prices as a consequence of increasing production 
costs and that it takes another season to producers to adapt to the new situation. In any case, and taking 
into account all the results found in this paper on price transmission, we can conclude that a cost-push 

 14



transmission mechanism prevails in the Tunisian agro-food sector. This result can be also confirmed 
by the significant response of inflation to increasing input prices. Finally, a positive shock in 
production costs reduces agricultural output the following year, which also would contribute to explain 
the significant increase of output prices during the second year after the shock. However, the effect on 
agricultural exports is not significant.

A positive shock in the exchange rate generates an immediate positive reaction in agricultural 
exports (Figure 4), confirming the idea we have mentioned above about the exchange rate as an 
important determinant of agricultural exports competitiveness. On the other hand, the effect on the rest 
of variables is negligible.

5. Concluding remarks 
The aim of this paper is to apply recent developments in the econometric analysis of time series 

to the study of relationships between macroeconomic variables and the agricultural sector in Tunisia. 
Results from this study suggest a number of points. The first one is that it is interesting to distinguish 
between long-run and short-run analyses. Long-run analysis is usually associated with structural 
relationships and it is in this context that theoretical restrictions have to be tested. Short-run analysis is 
also important for policy analysis as it gives an idea of the magnitude and time path of the reactions of 
economic variables to deviations from long-run relationships. However, the short-run responses of 
variables to shocks have to be calculated with the aid of theoretically based long-run economic 
restrictions.

The study has shown that changes in agricultural variables have no significant effects on 
macroeconomic variables. Only shocks in agricultural prices have an effect on inflation. The main 
source of responses of the agricultural sector (mainly agricultural output and exports) is changes in the 
monetary policy and, more precisely, on money supply, which is consistent with how monetary policy 
is instrumented in Tunisia. 

Agricultural prices responses to macroeconomic shocks are not very significant as an indication 
of the degree of government intervention in Tunisia. In the case of agricultural exports, responses are 
larger if they are generated by changes in the exchange rate than if they are generated by changes in 
output prices, which is an indication that macroeconomic variables have to take into account when 
designing the agricultural policy. In the same context, the agricultural supply is quite inelastic but it 
reacts more to changes in the capital cost than to changes in input or output prices.  To conclude, it has 
to be said that results presented in this paper depend on the variables and sample period chosen. 
Further analysis, including other variables and an extended sample period, could be conducted in the 
future.
