Abstract. Our paper seeks to assess the decision to adopt organic farming practices. More specifically, we use 
Duration Analysis (DA) to determine why farmers adopt organic farming and the timing of adoption. We extend 
previous studies by including farmers’ objectives, risk preferences and agricultural policies as covariates in the DA 
model. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a multi-criteria decision-making methodology to measure 
farmers’ objectives. The empirical analysis uses farm-level data collected through a questionnaire to a sample of 
vineyard holdings in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Farmers’ objectives are found to influence the conversion 
decision. Moreover, farmers who are not risk averse are more prone to adopt organic farming. Results also identify 
the policy changes that have been more relevant in motivating adoption of organic practices. 

Keywords: Organic farming adoption, Duration Analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process, farmers’ objectives. 

1. Introduction and objectives 
During the last few decades the European agriculture has been intensifying its production practices. 
Concerns and awareness about the negative externalities on humans, animals and the environment have 
been growing. In order to reduce the negative impacts derived from intensive farming, some 
environmentally friendly production methods such as organic agriculture have been promoted by EU 
public authorities. Organic agriculture mainly relies on non-polluting inputs and the management of the 
ecosystem as a whole. Synthetic inputs such as fertilizers or pesticides, veterinary drugs, and genetically 
modified seeds are replaced, whenever possible, by agronomic, biological and mechanical methods 
adapted to local conditions and needs. 

Organic farming, which has increased substantially in recent years, has received important attention 
within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP has provided support to organic farming since 
1991 by means of a premium subsidy program whereby farmers receive a fixed payment per crop and 
year (Regulation 2078/91). In 1999, another Regulation (1257/1999) was approved with the aim of 
improving the efficacy of organic farming started in 1991. The present support scheme for organic 
agriculture will be applied until 2013 under the rural development Regulation 1463/2006. Recently, 
Regulation 889/2008 was passed with the objective of ensuring a fair competition and a proper 
functioning of the internal market in organic products, and maintaining consumer confidence in products 
labeled as organic. 

There have been several studies that attempt to explain the determinants of adoption of organic 
production systems. Different approaches have been implemented for this purpose; a) the adoption 
approach which usually relies upon cross-sectional data which is analyzed by means of probability 
models to assess the likelihood that conversion occurs (Isin et al., 2007; Genius et al., 2006; De Cock, 
2005; Rigby and Young, 2005; Anderson et al., 2005 and Calatrava and González, 2008), b) the diffusion 
approach which deals with the cumulative adoption rate at the aggregate level using time-series data 
(Feder and Umali, 1993; Gardebroek and Jongeneel, 2004), c) the impact approach that focuses on the 
impact of conversion on the physical and financial performance of organic farms, by employing linear 
mathematical programming and simulation methods (Musshoff and Hirschauer, 2008; Acs et al., 2007 
and Kerselaers et al., 2007) and e) the comparison approach that compares organic and conventional 
farming in various management aspects such as input use, efficiency, productivity, as well as economic 
results, using basic statistics or profit maximization models, among other methods (Serra et al., 2007; 
Cisilino and Madau, 2007; Oude Lansink and Jensma, 2003; OECD, 2000; Tzouvelekas et al., 2001 and 
Klepper et al., 1977).

While the adoption approach fails to allow for the timing of the adoption of organic farming and the 
impact that time-varying factors may have on it, diffusion studies do not address the issue of why a 
particular farm adopts earlier than others (Burton et al., 2003). An alternative approach is Duration 
Analysis (DA) which is capable of analyzing both the decision and diffusion aspects of organic farming 
adoption. This is accomplished by analyzing cross-sectional and time-variant data jointly in a dynamic 
framework (McWilliams and Zilberman, 1996). The DA allows determining not only why farmers adopt 
organic farming, but also the timing of adoption and the factors that influence the observed time patterns. 
DA allows for changes in the explanatory factors both across farmers and time, thus studying adoption 
and diffusion together. 

Though DA was originally used in biometrics research, it has been applied in a wide range of analyses 
such as the duration of marriages, spacing births, time to adopt new technologies, product durability, 
occupational mobility, lifetime of firms, durations of wars, time from initiation to resolution of legal cases 
(Kiefer, 1988 and Lancaster, 1992), etc. The first application in economics was carried out by Lancaster 
(1978) in the field of labor economics, to analyze the duration of unemployment and the rates of entry and 
exit.  

In agriculture, DA has been recently applied in different adoption studies such as the adoption of 
conservation tillage (Fuglie and Kascak, 2001; and D’Emden et al., 2006), animal and plant breeding 
(Abdulai and Huffman, 2005; and Matuschke and Qaim 2008), input innovation (Dadi et al., 2004), and 
sustainable technology adoption (De Souza et al., 1998). Only a few analyses have used the DA to assess 
the adoption of organic farming practices: the published paper by Burton et al. (2003) and the 
unpublished manuscript by Hattam and Holloway (2007).  

Our paper aims to analyze the adoption of organic practices in the vineyard sector in the Spanish region 
of Catalonia by making use of DA. We seek to assess the influence of farmer characteristics, attitudes and 
opinions, farm structure, farm management results and other exogenous factors on adoption. In this 
context, our work contributes to previous literature by extending DA analysis to a consideration of farmer 
objectives as relevant factors in explaining the decision to convert. Our analysis also makes a thorough 
exploration of the role of farmers’ attitudes and opinions in organic farming adoption and introduces 
farmers’ risk preferences into the model. Additionally, we seek to analyze the impact of agricultural 
policy instruments on the duration of adoption. Another contribution of this article is the consideration of 
the random censoring feature that characterizes all organic adoption data and which has not been 
addressed before. Finally, this paper contributes to the scarce literature on the duration of organic 
adoption. In this context, there are no currently published studies on this topic in Spain. 

The determinants of organic farming adoption can be classified into two broad groups: non-economic and 
economic factors. The former group includes farmer’s attitudes, opinions and objectives as relevant 
elements. In the later group we mainly find market prices, profit making and public support. Most studies 
(Burton et al., 1999; Rigby et al., 2001; or Padel, 2001) that have analyzed the adoption of organic 
farming have found the relevance of both types of factors. In this line, attitudes and preferences are 
important determinants of adoption decisions (De Cock, 2005; De Souza et al., 1999; Burton et al., 1999 
and Ajzen and Fishebin, 1977). While differences in attitudes and opinions between organic and 
conventional farmers can contribute to explain conversion, they can usually interact and influence each 
other in a complex form (De Cock, 2005). To capture and simplify this complexity, we use the Principal 
Components Analysis (PCA). The resulting factors from PCA are used as explanatory variables of organic 
adoption. Moreover, we use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a multi-criteria decision-making 
methodology to measure farmers’ objectives and we include these measures as covariates in the DA. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides details on the organic sector in 
Spain and Catalonia. The third section explores studies on adoption in agriculture. In Sections 4 and 5, we 
present the conceptual framework and the empirical application, respectively. Results are discussed in 
section 6. Finally, some conclusions are outlined. 

2. The organic agriculture sector 
Organic agriculture has experienced rapid growth worldwide with currently 31 million ha being managed 
organically by at least 623,174 farms (Willer and Yussefi, 2006). Australia occupies the first position 
with 12.1 million ha, followed by the EU (6.6 million ha), China (3.5 million ha) and Argentina (2.8 
million ha).

In the EU the organic area represents 3.6% of the total utilized agricultural area (UAA) which is managed 
by 165,330 organic farms (FIBL, 2007). Italy holds the largest organic area within the EU (1,067,102 ha 
managed by 44,733 organic farms), followed by Germany (833,000 ha and 17,282 organic farms) and 
Spain (926,390 ha and 17,241 organic farms). If we rank EU countries according to the relative 
importance of the organic area within the total UAA, Spain occupies the 14th place with 3.7%. In the first 
positions we find Austria (14.2%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by Sweden, Portugal, Finland and Estonia 
with approximately 6.5% of their UAA. 

In Spain, the average size of an organic farm is about 51.5 ha, which is above the European average size 
(37.7 ha). Within the last 15 years the Spanish organic sector, as in most European countries, has 
experienced spectacular growth. While in 1991 there were only 369 organic operators, there are currently 
19,211 organic operators, of which 76.9% cultivate crops and 12.6% are livestock growers, according to 
the most recent available statistics (MARM, 2007). The remaining percentage represents processors and 
importers. The most important organic crops in Spain are cereals and pulses (12.23%), olives (10.09%), 
nuts (4.81%) and vineyards (1.82%).  

Spanish organic farming was at first regulated by a generic "organic produce" brand introduced in 1989. 
Initially, the national Board for Organic Agriculture was in charge of controlling production throughout 
the country. In 1993, the control was handed over to the regional authorities. In 2000, a logotype was 
created to be voluntarily used in the labeling of organic products. Recently, the National Organic Action 
Plan (2007 - 2010) has been approved in order to apply a set of specific actions on organic farming, 
organic produce processing, marketing, distribution and consumption, and also on the education and 
research areas (MARM, 2007). 

Catalonia is one of the most important regions within Spain in organic farming. It occupies the fourth 
place in the distribution of the Spanish organic area (5.96%), after Andalucía (57.90%), Aragón (7.50%) 
and Extremadura (6.95%). The Catalan sector also occupies the fourth position within the Spanish 
vineyard organic sector, representing 8.18% of the total area (MARM, 2007). Over the last decade, the 
Catalan organic vineyard sector has experienced the fastest growth within the Catalan organic sector, with 
an increase on the order of 565.06% from 1995 to 2006. Vineyard growth rates are followed by those 
experienced by cereals and pulses (355.11%), vegetables (318.39%), olive groves (168.29%) and nuts 
(23.03%).  

Catalonia has 147 registered organic vineyard farmers that represent the targeted organic population in 
our study. The decision to focus on this activity is based on various factors: a) the decision to go organic 
in this sector is not very likely to be subsidy-driven. It is more likely to be motivated by market 
conditions due to the high added value of its final product, b) the rapid growth of the Catalan organic 
vineyard sector compared to other sectors since 1995, and c) its relative weight within the total organic 
sector in both Spain and Catalonia. 

3. Determinants of adoption in agriculture 
Several studies (Knowler and Bradshaw, 2007; Rigby et al., 2001; Padel, 2001 and Lampkin and Padel, 
1994) have reviewed and summarized the factors that influence adoption decisions in agriculture. Rigby 
et al. (2001), Padel (2001), or Knowler and Bradshaw (2007) have focused their revision on organic 
farming. We update these latter revisions by listing new applications and studies, their applied 
methodology and sample size (Table 1). According to the studies reviewed, the most relevant factors that 
can influence the decision to convert from conventional to organic farming include: 

1. Farmer Characteristics: gender, education, age, experience, etc. 

2. Farm Structure: location, farm size, soil type, machinery, etc. 

3. Farm Management: input use, crop diversification, crop rotation, etc. 

4. Exogenous factors: output and input prices, market size, subsidies, information access, transition 
costs, policy reforms, etc. 

5. Attitudes and opinions: farmer beliefs about the environment, acceptance within the rural 
community, life style, health and environmental preoccupations, etc.

In Table 2 we present a summary of the variables that usually explain organic farming adoption and the 
impact they generally have on the decision to adopt. Young women with high levels of education are 
more likely to adopt. Conversely, older farmers with relevant social networks are less prone to convert. 
Adoption is also higher among family farms, farms with steep slope land, high soil quality and with easy 
access to water. Other farmer characteristics can also influence positively the decision to convert. Farmers 
who are concerned with environmental problems, food safety and soil degradation are more prone to 
adopt. Further, these farmers tend to use internet technology when managing the farm. With regards to the 
economic variables, we state the importance of policy support and price premiums as determinant factors 
of conversion.

4. Methods 
The five main groups of variables explaining adoption in agriculture and identified by the literature 
review in the previous section are used in our analysis. As noted these groups are Farmer characteristics 

( )iF , Farm structure ( )iS , Farm management and results ( )iM , Exogenous factors ( )iE , and 

Attitudes and opinions ( )iA . We contribute to previous literature by also including another set of 

variables representing Farmers’ objectives ( )iO . Farmers’ attitudes and opinions are summarized into 
factors by using the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and farmers’ objectives are measured by 
applying Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques. Below we offer details on AHP and DA 
methodologies. 

4.1. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) 

As mentioned before, we hypothesize that farmers’ objectives can play an important role in determining 
the adoption of organic practices (De Cock, 2005). However, to collect information about the relative 
importance of each objective for each farmer is usually a complicated task. To overcome this difficulty, 
we use the AHP methodology that measures and determines the relative importance of farmers’ 
objectives, allowing us to use the results as a covariate in the DA model. The AHP is a technique (Saaty, 
1977, 1980) to support multi-criteria decision-making in discrete environments. AHP allows us to weigh 
each farmer’s objectives and use them to explain production decisions. In order to implement the AHP, 



7 
 

one needs to carry out a survey where individuals are asked to value different objectives that follow a 
hierarchical structure (figure 1). We distinguish between economic, environmental and socio-cultural 
objectives. Each objective in the tree is divided into three different sub-objectives to be also valued. 

 

Figure 1: Hierarchical structure used to value conventional and organic farmers’ objectives 

 

The relative importance or weight (wi) of objectives are obtained from paired comparisons. In order to 
make these comparisons and determine the intensity of preferences for each option, Saaty (1980) 
proposed and justified the use of a 1 to 9 scale. The relative importance of each objective is obtained by 
comparing this objective with all other objectives. From the answers provided, a matrix with the 
following structure is generated for each individual (k) (Saaty matrix):

where aijk represents the value obtained from the comparison between objective i and objective j for each 
individual. This square matrix has two fundamental properties: (a) all elements of its main diagonal take a 
value of one (aiik=1 ∀ i), and (b) all other elements maintain that paired comparisons are reciprocal (if 
aijk=x then ajik=1/x). If perfect consistency in preferences holds for each decision-maker, it should also 
hold that aihk × ahjk = aijk for all i, j and h. This condition implies that values given for paired comparisons 
represent weights given to each objective by a perfectly rational decision-maker aijk= wik/wjk for all i and 
j. Therefore, the Saaty matrix can also be expressed as follows:

Thus, if the decision-maker’s property of perfect consistency holds, n weights (wik) for each objective can 
be easily determined from the n(n-1)/2 values for aijk. Unfortunately, perfect consistency is seldom 
present in reality, where personal subjectivity plays an important role in doing the paired comparison. For 
Saaty, matrices (Ak=aijk) in which some degree of inconsistency is present, alternative approaches have 
been proposed to estimate the weight vector that best resembles the decision-maker’s real weight vector. 
Saaty (1980 and 2003) proposed two options as the best estimate of real weights: the geometric mean and 
the main eigenvector. Other authors have proposed alternatives based on regression analysis (Laininen 
and Hämäläinen, 2003) or goal programming (Bryson, 1995). No consensus has been reached regarding 



8 
 

what alternative outperforms the others (Fichtner, 1986). As all criteria meet the requirements to estimate 
the above-mentioned weights, we choose the geometric mean (Aguarón and Moreno, 2000; Kallas et al., 
2007). Using this approach, weights assigned by farmers to each objective are obtained using the 
following expression: 

n
ni

i ijkik
aw ∏ === 1  ∀  i, k    (3) 

Variables ikw  are used as covariates in the DA analysis. AHP was originally conceived for individual 
decision-making, but it was rapidly extended as a valid technique for the analysis of group decisions 
(Easley et al., 2000). To compare objective weights between organic and conventional farmers, group 
preferences must be considered. Thus, we need to aggregate the corresponding farmer’s weights (wik) 
across farmers to obtain a synthesis of weights for each objective (wi). The aggregation process should be 
carried out following Forman and Peniwati (1998), who consider that the most suitable method for 
aggregating individual weights (wik) in a social collective decision-making context is that of the geometric 
mean: 

m
mk

k iki
ww ∏ === 1  ∀  i    (4) 

where iw  is used to summarize the results of the AHP analysis.  

4.2. The Duration Analysis (DA) 

Duration analysis (DA) or duration modeling, as known in the economics field, models the time length of 
a spell or the duration of an episode or “event”. The spell starts at the time of entry into a specific state 
and ends at a point when a new state is entered. As mentioned before, we apply DA to identify the 
determinants of adoption for organic practices and as well as the probability of a farm adopting organic 
practices at time t, given it has not been adopted by that time. We assume that the end of an event or the 
entering into a new state happens just once for each subject1. 

The conceptual foundations of DA rely on probability theory. Instead of focusing on the time length of a 
spell, one can consider the probability of its end or the probability of transition to a new state. To 
determine this probability, DA analysis uses the hazard function instead of the familiar probability 
distribution function. 

Consider ( )T  as the random variable that measures the length of a spell. Also consider t  as a realization 
of ( )T . Thus, the observed durations of each subject consist of a series of data 1 2( , ,... )nt t t . Let ( )f t  be 

a continuous probability distribution function (PDF) of the previously defined random variable ( )T . The 
probability distribution of the duration variable can be specified by the cumulative density function 
(CDF): 

0
( ) ( ) Pr( )

t
F t f s ds T t= = ≤∫         (5) 
which indicates the probability of the random variable T  being smaller than a certain value t . However, 
in duration analysis we are more interested in the probability that the spell has a length of at least t . This 
probability is given by the survivor function also known as the complementary cumulative distribution 
function (CCDF). 

( ) 1 ( ) ( ) Pr( )

S t F t f s ds T t

= − = = >∫       (6) 
The probability of a duration end or a regime change in the next short interval of time t∆ , given that the 
spell has lasted up to t  is: 
                                                           
1 When events happen more than once, a multilevel modeling for recurring events or repeated events should be 
applied (for more information see Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn, 2002 and Steele, 2008 among others). 



9 
 

Pr ( )t T t t T t≤ < + ∆ ≥
        (7) 

On the basis of this probability we define the hazard function or hazard rate that specifies the rate at 
which a spell is completed at time T t= , given it survives until time t . In other words, in our analysis, 
the hazard function represents the probability that a farmer adopts organic practices at time t , given he 
has not adopted before t :

Besides the length of a spell, a set of explanatory variables of economic and non-economic nature may be 
expected to influence and alter the distribution of the duration. With the inclusion of additional 
explanatory variables in the DA, the hazard function needs to be redefined and re-formulated as being 
conditional on these variables (Lancaster, 1992):

where β  is a vector of unknown parameters of x , the vector of explanatory variables which may include 

time invariant and time-varying variables and θ  is a vector of parameters that characterize the 
distribution function of the hazard rate. 

After the inclusion of the explanatory variables, the hazard function ( , , , )x θ βh t  can be split into two 
components. The first component is the part of hazard that depends on subject characteristics ( )x,βg . 
The second one is the baseline hazard function 0 ( )h t  which is equal to the hazard when all covariates are 
zero and therefore it does not depend on individual characteristics. This component captures the way the 
hazard rate varies along duration. 

To estimate the duration model we use the semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972). 
The Cox's semiparametric model has been widely used in the analysis of survival data to explain the 
effect of explanatory variables on hazard rates. Though the semiparametric model could potentially be 
less efficient than the parametric models in its use of the information provided by the data (D’Emden et 
al., 2006), the loss of efficiency is likely to be quite small (Efron, 1977 and Lawless, 1982). Moreover, 
when using this model we can gain robustness in return (Allison, 1995), because the estimates have good 
properties regardless of the actual shape of the baseline hazard function. In this context, the advantage of 
a semiparametric model is that no assumptions need to be made about the shape of the hazard function. 

Under the Cox proportional hazards model, the duration of each member of a population is assumed to

which eliminates the unknown baseline hazard 0 ( )h t

5. Empirical application 
Data used in this analysis were obtained from face-to-face questionnaires with farmers carried out during 
March-June 2008 in the major organic grape-growing areas in Catalonia. The choice of these areas was 
based on the list of certified organic farmers obtained from the official certification organism in Catalonia 
(CCPAE). Following previous research, neighboring conventional farms were also chosen so that the two 
subsamples would have an analogous composition (Tzouvelekas et al., 2001). Specifically, for each 
organic farm, we selected at least three conventional farms located in the same area. The final sample 
consists of 26 organic and 94 conventional farms.  

The survey collects extensive information on farmer’s characteristics, attitudes and opinions, farm 
physical and economic characteristics and on the determinants of adoption of organic practices. 

Information collected on farmer and household characteristics ( )iF  includes age, gender, education, 
whether other household members have a university degree, number of family members, or nearness of 

family and friends to farmer residence. Information gathered on farm characteristics ( )iS  consists of 
farm size, ownership of the farm, distance between farm and farmer residence, UAA, whether the farm is 
located in a disfavoured area according to the CAP, farm altitude, number of plots in the farm, water 
availability, soil quality, or number of organic farms within a 10 km radius. Variables reflecting farm 

management and results ( )iM  are: preferred sources of information on agricultural practices, number of 



11 
 

soil analyses per year, proportion of rented land, number of cultivated grape varieties, proportion of 
irrigated land, percentage of total family income coming from agriculture, internet and e-mail use, 
accounting software use, percentage of sales to conventional wholesalers and/or processors, family 
labour, number of generations working in the farm, paid Annual Working Units (AWU), income per 

hectare, or total cost per hectare. Exogenous factors ( )iE  include, among others, availability of 
information sources, difficulties in obtaining information, problems in getting loans, output prices, or 
public subsidies. 

Information on attitudes and opinions ( )iA  were collected by presenting farmers with a series of 
different statements about organic practices, environment, and other general questions. On a Likert scale 
from 0 to 10, farmers were asked how much they agreed with different statements on risk attitudes, the 
use of dangerous and chemical inputs, regulatory issues, the perception of economic agents toward 
organic farming, farmers’ incentives to convert and farmer’s opinions toward organic farming. Since 
extensive information on this issue was gathered and as noted above, the available information was 
reduced to lower dimensions using PCA. The resulting factors were used in a subsequent step as 
independent variables in the DA.  

Information on farmers’ objectives2 ( )iO  was collected by asking farmers to make a paired comparison 
of different objectives using a 1 to 9 scale. As noted, three primary objectives were considered in the 
comparison: economic, environmental and socio-cultural. Within each primary objective, farmers were 
also asked to compare three secondary objectives in a pair wise nature. Secondary economic objectives 
were: “maximize vineyard sales”, “maximize total farm income from agricultural and non-agricultural 
activities” and “maximize profits”. The environmental secondary objectives included: “promoting 
environmentally friendly farming practices”, “maintain soil fertility” and “rational use of water”. The 
secondary socio-cultural objectives were: “generate employment in the farmer area”, “keep the existing 
socio-cultural values” and “prevent the depopulation of rural areas”. From the results, we identified the 
relative weights of each objective that were then used as covariates in the DA. 

Apart from the information collected in the survey, other time-variant variables were also considered in 
the DA, in order to capture systematic changes in the economic conditions and farmers’ characteristics 
that could affect their decision to adopt (Burton et al., 2003 and Allison, 1995). We used several dummy 
variables representing policy changes which include a dummy taking the value of one on and after the 
year 1991, when regulation 2078/91 was passed, and zero otherwise. Another dummy variable 
representing the period from the creation of the official certification organism in Catalonia in 1995 and 
onwards, was also defined. In addition, a dummy variable was used to distinguish between the post and 
pre Regulation 1257/1999 period. Finally, a dummy variable was considered to capture the impact of the 
creation of the logotype “organic agriculture- control system” in 2001. Furthermore, several calendar year 
time trend covariates were considered (Burton et al., 2003). The first one takes a value of -31 in 1961 
(first year “at risk”, i.e. first entry date in our sample), with an increment of one until 1991. The second 
one takes a value of -35 in 1961, with an increment of one until 1995. The last trend takes a value of -39 
in 1961, with increment of one until 1999. 

The dependent variable used in the DA is the time farmers waited before adopting organic farming. As 
Kiefer (1988) mentions, DA requires a precise beginning time to compute the duration. In our case, it was 
set as the date when the farmer started to manage holding3. It is also necessary to define a time scale 
which is “years” in our case, as well as the event ending duration (the year when the farmer adopts 
organic practices). Because not all farmers had adopted organic farming by the time of carrying out the 
survey, a right censoring characterizes our data. Further, as mentioned before, the data suffer from the 
random censoring characteristic. This characteristic is  due to different entry times (the year when the 
farmer started managing the farm), that vary randomly across farmers. As Allison (1995) recommends, an 
easy solution to random censoring is to include the entry time as a covariate in the regression. 

 

                                                           
2 Primary and secondary objectives were defined in two different focus groups, The first was integrated by university 
faculty in the field of agricultural economics, and the second was composed by policy makers and leaders of 
agricultural associations. 
3 This decision was taken because organic farming has always been “available” to farms (Burton et al., 2003).

6. Results 
As a result of the PCA application to measure farmers’ attitudes and opinions, several factors were 
obtained. The first PCA was applied to the variables measuring the perception by the farmer of the 
attitudes of society toward organic farming. The resulting relevant factors are: “perception by commercial 

agents” 1( )a  and “perception by social agents” 2( )a  (see Table 3). The second PCA was applied to 
farmers’ incentives to convert to organic farming. The derived factors are: “National and international 

perspectives” 3( )a , “economic motivations” 4( )a  and “personal motivations” 5( )a . The third PCA 

was applied to farmers’ own opinions toward organic farming with “quality and image” 6( )a and “future 

viability” 7( )a as relevant factors.

As noted above, the AHP allows obtaining the weights assigned by each individual to the primary and 
secondary objectives using the geometric mean criteria. The results of the aggregation of the weights for 

the three primary objectives ( 1wo , 2wo  and 3wo ) across farmers are shown in Table 4.

* Computed discarding the 25% lowest scores and the 25% highest ones. 

These results suggest that for conventional farmers the economic objective is the most important with an 

aggregate weight ( 1wo ) of 62.3%. Environmental ( 2wo ) and socio-cultural ( 3wo ) objectives occupy 
the second and third positions with aggregate weights of 24.1% and 13.6%, respectively. This hierarchy is 
also applicable to the organic group, but environmental and socio-cultural objectives have a higher 
relative relevance to the detriment of the economic objective. 

Results from weighting the secondary objectives are summarized in Figure 2. As can be seen, there are 
differences in relative weights between conventional and organic farmers. It is worth mentioning that 
while organic farmers are more interested in promoting practices that do not harm the environment, 
conventional farmers give more importance to water and soil quality. From these results we derive the 
proportions of the relative weights within the primary and secondary objective groups for each individual 
(see Table 5 for summary statistics). As explained, these proportions are used in a posterior step as 
independent variables in the DA.

Different DA models were estimated using different combinations of the variables available from the 
survey. We followed the forward stepwise method to determine the final list of variables to include in the 
model. Summary statistics of these explanatory variables for both types of farmers are shown in 
Appendix 1. The resulting model is presented in Table 6. At a 95% confidence level, we can reject the 
null hypothesis that all coefficients are jointly equal to zero.  

The presence of a local authority serving as a source of information is found to increase the hazard 
function, which involves a reduction in the time needed to convert. This result is in accordance with the 
findings of Rigby et al. (2001), Padel, (2001) and Parra and Calatrava (2005) who conclude that the 
availability of information sources is an important factor in explaining conversion. Results also suggest 
that farmers that are not risk averse are more prone to adopt organic farming, confirming the findings by 
De Cock (2005) who states that conventional farmers usually pay more attention to risk than organic 
farmers. Compatible with these results, Serra et al. (2008) and Gardebroek (2006) find that organic 
farmers are less risk averse than their conventional counterparts. Our results also show that difficulties in 
getting loans increase adoption. This result could be explained by the fact that adopters are mainly small 
family farms that usually display more conservative leverage levels and have more problems in getting 
loans than their conventional counterparts. The finding that credit restrictions reduce adoption is in 
contrast with the results obtained by Padel (2001) and Rigby et al. (2001) who find that refusal of loans 
and insurance is one of the most important institutional barriers to adoption.  

As expected, we find that the location of farms in a disfavored area, which usually involves the presence 
of some management difficulties, motivates adoption. This is in accord with the results by Padel and 
Lampkin (1994), Padel (2001) and Rigby and Young (2000). Farmers who have a second economic 



15 
 

activity, apart from agriculture, are more likely to convert. Also, farmers whose total farm income is only 
coming from viticulture are less prone to convert. These results are in line with those obtained by Peters 
(1994), Padel (2001) and Hanson et al. (2004) who found that diversification of production may play an 
important role in increasing the probability of conversion. These results are also compatible with the fact 
that organic farms usually diversify their activities, which reduces the risk derived from possible yield 
losses. Farmers whose decision to adopt is mainly based on commercial reasons are found to have a lower 
hazard.

Results suggest also that farmers with positive attitudes and opinions toward organic farming have a 
shorter duration. Those who believe in a positive perception of social agents towards organic agriculture, 
agree that dangerous chemical inputs should be prohibited and consider that organic products are of high 
quality, have a higher hazard to convert. Rigby et al. (2001) and Parra and Calatrava (2005) also found 
that positive attitudes positively influence the decision to adopt.  

Other obtained results are also as expected. Compatible with Padel (2001), Rigby and Young (2000) and 
Anderson et al. (2005), older farmers are found to be less likely to adopt. Farmers who have recently 
undertaken the management of the farm have a higher hazard to convert. Moreover, in accordance with 
other studies (Lockeretz, 1995; Lipson, 1999; Burton et al., 1999; Padel, 2001, and Hattam and 
Holloway, 2004), organic holdings tend to be smaller than conventional farms. Thus, large farms have a 
lower hazard and thus a higher duration-time. It is also worth mentioning that an increase in white wine 
prices increases the hazard which, consistent with Rigby and Young (2000), Burton et al. (2001) and De 
Cock (2005), suggests the relevance of economic determinants when explaining adoption. Furthermore, 
white wine represents 70% of the total wine produced in Catalonia (mainly sold as sparkling wine) and is 
one of the most popular exports from the region (MARM, 2007). This explains the relevance of white 
wine prices among the determinants of adoption. 

Most of the dummy variables representing policy changes are not statistically significant, with the 
exception being the dummy variable representing the year 2001. This specific year has a significant 
positive impact on the decision to convert suggesting that the introduction of the organic farming 
logotype motivated further conversion. 



16 
 

Our results suggest that the importance of the environmental over the economic considerations is a basic 
factor in the decision to adopt. Thus, an increase in the weight of the environmental objectives over the 
weight of the economic objectives leads to an increase in the hazard. Further, an increase in the weight 
that farmers attribute to adopting “farming practices which are respectful with the environment” to the 
detriment of a “rational use of water” decreases the waiting time to convert. Moreover, an increase in the 
importance of the objective “generate employment in the farmer area” over the objective “preventing the 
depopulation of rural areas” increases the probability to convert in a shorter time. These results suggest 
that both the commitment of organic farmers to the preservation of the environment and the generation of 
economic activity are important determinants to conversion. Previous empirical analyses have shown that 
organic farming is more labour demanding than conventional agriculture (OECD, 2000). In this line, our 
results demonstrate that the aspect of generating employment is an important factor for conversion and 
highlights the social role of the vineyard organic agriculture in Catalonia. 

7. Conclusions 
Our paper focuses on assessing the determinants of organic farming adoption as well the timing of the 
conversion decision. We carry out an empirical analysis using the Duration Analysis (DA) due to its 
potential to analyze both the decision and diffusion aspects of organic farming adoption. The model is 
estimated using farm-level data from a sample of both organic and conventional Catalan farms 
specialized in grape production. Data were collected though a questionnaire carried out in 2008. 

The dependent variable used in the DA is the time farmers waited before adopting organic farming as 
measured by the number of years after the farmers were responsible for farm management. Several 
explanatory variables were considered representing farmer and farm characteristics, farm management 
and results, exogenous factors, attitudes and opinions and farmers’ objectives. We used the Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) to measure farmers’ objectives and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
to synthesize information on farmers’ attitudes and opinions. 

Several variables are found to increase the hazard of adoption. Farmers who have recently undertaken the 
management of the farm, who are risk loving, are willing to preserve the environment and generate 
employment in their area, are more prone to adopt in a shorter period of time. Small farms that are located 
in less favored areas and that diversify their production also display higher hazard rates. Farmers 
receiving higher output prices, who have difficulties in accessing credit and that have a second economic 
activity besides farming, are more likely to adopt as well. Finally, easy access to information sources, the 
presence of local agricultural authorities and some policy regulations also motivate higher adoption rates. 
On the other hand, older farmers whose decisions are mainly based on economic variables and who are 
running very specialized and big farms, have a low hazard to adopt organic practices.  

Our analysis is based on a semi-parametric approach that still requires the parameterization of the risk 
function. Misspecification of this function will lead to inconsistent results. Our results should thus be 
interpreted carefully. To overcome this limitation, the literature on the topic has recently proposed the use 
of local estimation techniques. It would thus be interesting to compare our results with the ones derived 
from this alternative approach. This task is however beyond the scope of the paper and is proposed for 
future research.
