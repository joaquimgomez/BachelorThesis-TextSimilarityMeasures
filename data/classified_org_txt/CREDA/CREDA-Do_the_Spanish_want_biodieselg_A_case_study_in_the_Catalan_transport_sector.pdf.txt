Abstract 7 

In this paper, we analyse the opinions, attitudes and willingness of consumers to pay for 8 

biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in Barcelona province. Data were gathered from face-to-9 

face structured questionnaires from 300 diesel car owners/users that regularly purchase fuel. 10 

A variation of the traditional choice experiments (CE) was used by excluding the price attribute 11 

from the design. In a subsequent contingent valuation (CV) exercise, respondents were asked 12 

to state their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for their preferred choice sets using the 13 

“payment card” format. The relative importance of the attributes and levels were calculated by 14 

estimating a random parameter logit model. The results demonstrated, contrary to the literature 15 

in Spain, that consumers were not willing to pay for biodiesel, especially when its production 16 

may negatively affect food prices. The main limitation was that car manufacturers do not 17 

recommend its use as it may lead to engine failure. The public authorities are asked to work 18 

jointly with the automotive industry to address this drawback. 19

1. Introduction 23 

Renewable energy sources are becoming an increasingly important issue in the political 24 

agenda of countries all over the world. They are considered a primary driver of economic 25 

progress, enabling countries to reduce energy dependency, achieve goals of sustainability and 26 

enhance competitiveness [1]. In the last decades, the global debate on the environment and 27 

climate change was primarily focused on the reduction of the emission of CO2, which is 28 

considered a major source of the greenhouse gas effect [2]. As a consequence, many 29 

countries adopted policies and strategies to diversify their energy sources in many sectors, 30 

transport being the most important one. According to Eurostat (Table 1), in 2011, the 31 

production of the total renewable energy2 in the EU 27 has increased significantly, reaching 32 

208,006 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE). Germany leads the list of the EU countries, 33 

followed by France, Spain and Italy. 34

The European transport sector, including the Spanish sector, faces two major 39 

challenges. First, it depends greatly on imported energy sources, especially fuel oil, which is 40 

one of the fossil fuels that contributes to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases 41 

[3]. This sector accounted for more than 20% of the total EU emissions in 2010 [4]. This 42 

situation limits the possibility of meeting the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol and increases 43 

the energy dependence of the EU [5]. According to the data from Eurostat, the EU is energy 44 

deficient, with energy dependency of 53% in 2010. Second, price volatility, the continuous 45 

increase in the prices of fossil fuels, and uncertainties regarding its availability generate 46 

concerns for its long term sustainability. 47 

In this context, the Spanish transport sector experienced a significant increase in road 48 

infrastructure of approximately 16,000 km in early 2012, behind only the US and China in 49 

absolute terms [6], and its greenhouse emissions have increased by 66% since 1990. It is the 50

thermal, biomass and renewable wastes, wood and wood wastes, hydro power, wind power, solar photovoltaic and

largest user of final energy, accounting for 40% of the total final consumption [7].Thus, reducing 51 

its emissions is crucial to reducing overall emission. As indicated by Labandeira [8], the low 52 

taxation of car fuels in Spain, which is 20% below the European averages for 2010, the shift 53 

of car fleets to diesel due to its low relative price [9] and the consequent increase of problems 54 

related to local greenhouse gases in Madrid and Barcelona make this sector a relevant case 55 

study [10,6].  56 

Biofuels as a renewable energy source have been viewed for decades as a worthwhile 57 

alternative to address these challenges. However, the shift toward this source remains weak 58 

[11]. Their total production in the EU27 increased from 7 TOE in 1991 (mainly produced by 59 

Austria) to 11,455 TOE. In 2011, Germany was the major European producer of biofuel, 60 

followed by France, Italy and Spain (Table 1). Biodiesel represents the major share of biofuel 61 

production, reaching 71% (8,112 TOE) of the total EU 27 production. The EU is the world’s 62 

largest biodiesel producer, representing, on a volume basis, approximately 70% of the total 63 

biofuels market share in the transport sector [12]. The largest producer of biodiesel is Germany 64 

followed by France, Spain and Italy (Table1). 65 

In the last decade, the production of biofuels, in particular first-generation biofuels, has 66 

generated a debate about the impact of production on food prices. The debate regarding the 67 

negative effect of biofuels on food security around the world is not quite new. Within this 68 

context, there are two clearly differentiated opinions on if and to what extent biofuel production 69 

affects feedstock prices. On the one hand, certain studies have stated that biofuels are not 70 

responsible for the price increase and volatility of feedstock. Ajanovic [13] concluded that the 71 

increases in biofuel production have a non-significant impact on feedstock prices in the case 72 

of corn, wheat, barley, sugarcane, rapeseed, soybean and sunflower. Escobar et al. [14] and 73 

Rathmann et al. [15] stated that rising feedstock prices are primarily related to other factors, 74 

such as oil price developments, financial speculation and the recent strong economic growth 75 

of China. However, on the other hand, several studies noted that the food price increases have 76 

been mainly the result of the expansion of biofuels [16,17,18,19,20,21]. Mitchel [22] mentioned 77 

that the biofuel market expansion had led farmers to produce crops for the biofuels sector, 78 

driven by several subsidy programs, at the expense of the local and international food markets. 79 

He concluded that the most important factor in the growth of food prices is the large increase 80 

in biofuel production in the US and the EU. 81 

In considering the empirical analysis of the relation between biofuel production and 82 

feedstock prices, we can analyse two approaches: the first focuses on the supply side of 83 

biodiesel. This approach analyses the advantages and shortcomings of the production and its 84 

relation to agricultural feedstock and food prices. The second relies on the analysis of the 85 

demand side and focuses on the social attitudes and opinions toward biodiesel and the public 86 



4 
 

opinion on its relation to the increase in food prices. The combination of both approaches is 87 

necessary to determine the optimal provision of biofuels from a social point of view. In theory, 88 

once the optimum is located, the policy authorities will be in a position to design the appropriate 89 

instruments to correct the market failures. 90 

In recent years, certain studies have addressed the first approach, especially after the 91 

2008 food price crisis, focusing their analysis on price volatility and the relationship between 92 

biodiesel production and food prices [23]. However, there is a scarcity of studies that have 93 

focused on the perceptions of society regarding biodiesel production and the opinions and 94 

acceptances of the role they play in rising food prices, in particular in Spain. In this context, the 95 

main objective of this paper is to analyse consumer opinion and attitudes toward biodiesel as 96 

an alternative fuel in Barcelona Province (Spain) and their willingness to pay for it. The 97 

importance of using this region as a case study is the high degree of dependence on imported 98 

energy sources, the high energy consumption per unit of GDP and the environmental problems 99 

caused mainly by the increased GHG emissions from the transport sector [6]. 100 

 101 

2. Literature review 102 

Biofuels are derived from biomass3, which mainly includes ethanol and biodiesel [24]. 103 

There are four known generations of biofuels. The first generation is directly related to a 104 

biomass that is generally edible [11] and produced directly from food crops. The most common 105 

for ethanol production are corn, sugar beets and sugar cane, while for biodiesel production 106 

palm oil, rapeseed and soybean are the main crops. The second generation is produced from 107 

non-food crops, such as wood, organic waste (municipal solid wastes) and other food crop 108 

waste. The third generation focuses on improvements in the production process of biomass, 109 

introducing algae as a principal energy source [25]. The introduction of algae is due to its 110 

potential to produce more energy per acre than conventional crops. The fourth generation is 111 

similar to the second and third generations with the difference that during the production 112 

process, the carbon emission is captured and stored, locking away more carbon than it 113 

produces. 114 

The biomass-based fuel may have advantages and disadvantages. From one 115 

perspective, biofuels might be manufactured from a wide range of materials, thus improving 116 

the recycling efficiency. They are easily renewable as new crops are grown and waste material 117 

is collected [26]. Moreover, because they are produced locally, they help reduce the foreign 118 

energy dependency and create new jobs in rural areas [27]. They also may provide economic 119 

                                                            
3 As mentioned by the International Energy Agency, biomass is any organic, i.e. decomposing, matter derived from 
plants or animals available on a renewable basis. Biomass includes wood and agricultural crops, herbaceous and 
woody energy crops, and municipal organic wastes, as well as manure.

incentives for the agricultural sector if the demand for the energy crops increases [28]. Finally, 120 

less carbon output and toxins are produced when it is burned in comparison to the fossil fuels. 121 

However, biofuels may not be worth producing, especially those from the first generation [29]. 122 

Those that are based on raw agricultural material produce negative net energy gains because 123 

the carbon footprint (the machinery necessary to cultivate the crops and the plants to produce 124 

the fuel) is high. Food prices and shortages may also be affected. As the demand for raw 125 

agricultural material grows for biofuel production, it could also raise the prices for the necessary 126 

primary food crops [30]. Water demand for biofuel production is also high, both for the irrigation 127 

of the crops as well as for the production process of fuel [30]. 128 

Within this debate, the regulations for producing biofuels in recent years have undergone 129 

remarkable changes. In September 2013, a narrow majority of European Parliament voted that 130 

"first generation" biofuels should not exceed 6% of the final energy consumption in transport 131 

by 2020, while advanced biofuels should represent at least 2.5% of the energy consumption 132 

in transport. These changes affected the Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of 133 

energy from renewable sources, which set up mandatory targets for its member states of a 134 

20% share of renewable energy in the total energy consumption and a 10% share of energy 135 

from renewable sources (primary biofuels) in all forms of transport by 2020. Member states 136 

may introduce for themselves the measures that promote biofuel consumption to reach this 137 

goal. It is worth mentioning that Spain has set a renewable energy target in the transport sector 138 

that is 3.6 points above the 10% binding European objective for 2020 [5]. 139 

The renewable energy policy in Spain, with its emphasis on biofuels, progressed in line 140 

with other EU counties and presents a response to the main challenges that the Spanish 141 

energy sector has faced in the last decades. In the Spanish biofuel market, biodiesel plays a 142 

predominant role because the consumption of bioethanol is negligible compared to the USA, 143 

which is the case for all European countries [31]. This policy follows both the Renewable 144 

Energy Directive (RED) [27] and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) [32]. The former involves the 145 

need to meet 10 per cent of the transport energy demand from renewable sources by 2020; 146 

the latter, to reduce the emissions of the transport fuels by at least 6 per cent by 2020. 147 

In June 2007, Spain imposed mandatory biofuel blending for transport with Law 12/2007. 148 

The FQD enabled fuel operators to market B7 and E10, which are blends with a volumetric 149 

biodiesel content of 7 per cent and an ethanol content of 10 per cent, respectively. It is worth 150 

mentioning that in 2011, biodiesel production in Spain has decreased from 841 TOE in 2010 151 

to 679 TOE as a result of the worldwide economic crisis. Biofuels in Spain are supported due 152 

to their joint production with other public goods. The biofuel industry in 2011 was supported 153 

with €237 million for ethanol and €1,002 million for biodiesel [26]. Biodiesel consumption was 154 

supported with €0.31 per litre and €0.40 per litre for ethanol.  155

Without presenting an extensive review, fewer studies have focused on the public 156 

preferences and the willingness to pay for biodiesel, in particular in Spain. In the US, Petrolia 157 

et al. [33] analysed the preferences of ethanol (E-10 and E-85); Delshad et al. [34] also 158 

analysed different policies to promote biofuel, and Solomon and Johnson [35] analysed the 159 

WTP for biomass ethanol. Ma et al. [36] Analysed factors affecting adoption of biodiesel in 160 

China. Arabatzis and Malesios [37] assessed the determinants factors of the renewable energy 161 

choice and Savvanidou et al. [38] studied car users and their WTP for biofuels in Greece. 162 

Jeanty et al. [39], and Jeanty and Hitzhusen [40] estimated the WTP for the reduction of air 163 

pollution, which is brought about by using biodiesel in the US. In Spain, Giraldo et al. [41] and 164 

Loureiro et al. [6] focused on the willingness to pay for biodiesel. These studies were conducted 165 

in Spain, and their results indicated that although consumers have low levels of knowledge 166 

about biodiesel, there is a positive perception of biodiesel due to its environmental impacts, 167 

which consequently demonstrated that consumers are willing to pay more for biodiesel than 168 

for conventional diesel and are ready to use it. 169 

In this context, our paper attempts to verify these hypotheses especially after the 170 

worldwide economic crisis. This study aims to fill the gap in the existing literature by attempting 171 

to elicit consumer preferences for biofuels by investigating the WTP for biodiesel in Catalonia 172 

(Spain), taking into consideration the current discussions surrounding the development of 173 

alternative fuels for transport. 174 

3. Material and methods 175 

3.1. Data sample and collection 176 

The data used in this analysis were obtained from 300 face-to-face questionnaires with 177 

the drivers/owners of diesel engine vehicles in the Barcelona Province (the city of Barcelona 178 

and the suburbs). The population represents consumers over 18 years of age who are car 179 

users/owners and thus regularly purchase diesel fuel (Table 2). We follow a quota sampling 180 

procedure stratified by age and gender, and the participants are selected randomly. This 181 

distribution, however, does not have to be in proportion to the population of Barcelona 182 

Province, as we restrict the sample to consumers who own/drive a diesel vehicle. As we are 183 

not able to access the total number of diesel vehicles registered in Barcelona Province and the 184 

distribution of their drivers by gender and age, we use a proxy variable. The citizens with a 185 

driver’s licence in the province of Barcelona stratified by age and gender have been used. 186 

Nevertheless, this set does not reflect the citizens who drive diesel vehicles in each strata; 187 

thus, we correct the strata percentage using the primary information obtained from face-to-188 

face interviews with several authorised car dealers and garages. The final description of the 189 

sample is discussed in the results section. 190

A structured questionnaire has been designed to analyse consumer preferences and 194 

attitudes towards biodiesel as well as their maximum willingness to pay for it. The questionnaire 195 

was divided into several parts: 196 

 In the first part, consumer awareness and knowledge of biodiesel is measured (familiarity 197 

with biodiesel, the raw materials to produce biodiesel and the present percentage of 198 

biodiesel mixture in the market). 199 

 In the second part, consumers were asked about the use of diesel and biodiesel as a 200 

fuel in their cars, the frequency of use, their car’s fuel efficiency (l/km), the purchase, the 201 

consumption and the year of registration. 202 

 In the third part, respondents were asked to indicate their opinion towards the relation 203 

between food and biodiesel and its environmental impact. They were also asked about 204 

the alternatives that they would choose if fuel prices continue to rise. The questions were 205 

formulated on an 11-point scale ranging from “0 to10”, the most understood scale in 206 

Spain. 207 

 The fourth part is focused on analysing the most important factors that consumers take 208 

into consideration when deciding to refuel their car and their willingness to pay for 209 

biodiesel, using an approach that applies the joint use of the choice experiment and the 210 

contingent valuation 211 

 The final part contains questions on the socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, 212 

family size and composition, age, education level, and income) and other psychographic 213 

variables. 214 

 215 
3.2. The experimental design 216 

In analysing “complex goods” the choice experiment (CE) is one of the most relevant 217 

methods. It involves the characterisation of the product through a series of descriptors that can 218 

be combined following an orthogonal fractional factorial design to create different hypothetical 219 

scenarios of the product (alternatives). The respondents are faced with several of these 220 

scenarios (choice sets) and are asked to select their preferred alternative at different price 221 



8 
 

levels while implicitly making a trade-off between attributes. However, in our approach, we 222 

exclude the monetary attribute from the design of the scenarios, and we subsequently ask 223 

respondents for their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) following a contingent valuation (CV) 224 

exercise. Within the CV, respondents were asked to state their maximum WTP using the 225 

“payment card” format, as it combines both the advantages of the open-ended formats (the 226 

elicitation of the point information of the WTP) and of the close-ended formats (the ease of the 227 

cognitive burden on the interviewees) while minimising the risk of the “starting-price bias” 228 

associated with the iterative bidding processes [42]. This procedure is related to the dual 229 

response choice experiment (DRCE) design proposed by Brazell et al. [43], with the exception 230 

that the price in our case was set in a contingent valuation exercise. Asking consumers whether 231 

they are willing to purchase the product emphasises the purchasing context, which leads the 232 

respondents to focus more on their budget constraints and places more attention on the price. 233 

In contrast, in the traditional single-stage CE, the respondents can be driven by reason and 234 

logical arguments rather than by price considerations [44]. Figure 1 represents the 235 

experimental design used in our study. 236

0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.20 1.40 1.60 1.80 2.0 

Figure 1: Example of the choice set 238 

First, individuals are asked to choose their preferred scenario from three possible 239 

alternatives. Afterward, the respondents are faced with a “pay/not to pay” decision response 240 

mode for the preferred scenario to set their maximum WTP. Introducing this follow-up question 241 

allows individuals to approach the information twice regarding their preferences, first by stating 242 

what they prefer and subsequently if they are willing to pay for it and if they can afford it. Asking 243 

consumers about the maximum willingness to pay in a purchasing context may bring them to 244 

a greater emphasis on their budget constraints. 245 

Due to the hypothetical nature of the assessment of the willingness to pay, a standard 246 

cheap talk was used in the survey process as proposed by Carlsson et al. [45] and Bosworth 247 

and Taylor [46]: “Previous studies indicate that individuals in general respond to surveys 248 



9 
 

differently from the way they act in real life. It is quite common to find that individuals say they 249 

are willing to pay higher prices than those that they are really willing to pay. We believe that 250 

this is due to the difficulty in calculating the exact impact of these higher expenses on the 251 

household economy. It is easy to be generous when in reality one does not need to pay more”. 252 

Applying the previous design to analyse the attributes that consumers take into 253 

consideration when he/she refuels and the relative importance of biodiesel, the first and most 254 

important step is to identify the attributes and their levels. After reviewing the market conditions 255 

in Barcelona Province and the abovementioned literature research on the relevant topic of 256 

consumer preferences toward biofuels, four attributes have been selected with their levels: 257 

1) Type of diesel. This attribute was straightforward because it is a main objective of the 258 

study. According to the available mixtures of biodiesel on the Spanish fuel market, we 259 

assess four levels of this attribute, one of them being the conventional diesel and the other 260 

three being the mixtures of 10% (B10), 20% (B20) and 30% (B30) biodiesel. 261 

2) Location of petrol stations. This attribute takes two levels to demonstrate whether the 262 

location of the petrol station affects the decision of the consumers to select the preferred 263 

station. We define the two levels as on the “usual route” and “outside the usual route”` for 264 

the consumers. 265 

3) Type of the petrol station. For the more than 10,000 petrol stations in Spain, we assign two 266 

levels for this attribute. The first one is referred to as the “local petrol stations”, which 267 

represents the 33.85% that belong to local operators, cooperatives and supermarkets. The 268 

other belongs to the “multinational operators”, which represents 66.15% of the total. 269 

4) Price of the bread. Due to the potential relation between the feedstock price and 270 

biofuels production, we used the price of bread as a proxy variable to analyse this 271 

trade-off. Rosillo-Calle et al. [47] mentioned that an increase in the cost of raw materials 272 

in the US (vegetable oils) also leads to an increase in the commercial price of bread 273 

and breakfast cereals. Pimentel et al. [48] also noted that biofuel production in the U.S. 274 

increases the price of bread among other food products by approximately 10% to 30%. 275 

Tokgoz et al. [49] stated that biofuel production in the US had an impact on planted 276 

acreage, crop prices, livestock production and retail food costs, leading to an increase 277 

in the price of bread and bakery items. Thus, the price of bread was used due to its 278 

daily consumption in our case study region and because consumers are more familiar 279 

with its price. In addition, the bread price is also related to cereals as well as to 280 

vegetable oils prices. In Spain oil seeds are used to produce biodiesel, the direct effect 281 

of increased biodiesel production is likely to be felt on vegetable oil prices but also on 282 

cereals crops as both compete for the same agricultural land and thus its production is 283 

affected. This attribute will indicate the impact of the potential price increase of bread 284 



10 
 

as a result of increasing biofuel production on consumer decisions to purchase 285 

biodiesel. We evaluate the following four levels of this attribute for bread prices: 286 

unchanged, might increase by 5%, 10% and 20%. 287 

 288 

Our sample was divided into two equal subsamples with 150 consumers each. Both 289 

subsamples share all of the survey questions but differ by the number of attributes included in 290 

the CE analysis. The choice sets were created using a fractional factorial orthogonal design. 291 

For the first sample, we include the first three attributes (type of diesel, location of petrol 292 

stations, type of petrol station), leading to eight choice sets that are presented for each 293 

participant. For the second subsample, we include the fourth attribute (bread price), obtaining 294 

16 choice sets. This differentiation was made to estimate how the changes in the price of bread 295 

can influence the purchasing decision for biodiesel and to compare how the preferences are 296 

affected by the presence of this attribute. To avoid the fatigue effects associated with the 297 

multiple-scenario valuation tasks, the 16 choice cards were divided into two blocks with eight 298 

choice sets each following the factorial blocking procedure. 299 

 300 

3.3. The econometric modelling 301 

The choice data obtained from the first question in our experimental design (Figure 1) 302 

were analysed using the traditional data treatment of the CE. Thus, following the Random 303 

Utility Theory [50], the subjects choose among scenarios according to a utility function with two 304 

components: a systematic (i.e., observable) component plus a random term (non-observable 305 

by the researcher): 306 

( , )in in i n inU V X S          (1) 307 

Where inU  is the utility provided by alternative i  to subject n , inV  is the systematic 308 

component of the utility, iX  is the vector of attributes of alternative i , nS  is the vector of socio-309 

economic characteristics of the respondent n , and in  is the random term. 310 

To predict the subjects’ preferences for the attributes and their levels, it is necessary to 311 

define the “probability of choice” that an individual n chooses the alternative i rather than the 312 

alternative j  (for any i  and j  within choice sets ( )C ), which is equivalent to the probability 313 

that iU  is greater than jU . Several probabilistic models are available to analyse the choice-314 

stated data from the CE. The Conditional Logit Model (CL) is the basic model whereby the 315 

probability that an individual n will choose alternative i  ( inP ) among other alternatives ( 1j   316 

to J ) of a set ( )C  is formulated as follows [51]: 317

where   is a scale parameter that is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of 319 

the error terms. Within this model, the inV must be defined. In our case, we follow a separable, 320 

additive and linear utility function as follows: 321 

in k ik k ik inV X X           (3)

 

322 

where ( )k  is a mean effect for each attribute level, ( )kX  is the value of attribute 323 

1...k K  in alternative i , ( )k  is the standard deviation, and in  is the error term. This utility 324 

specification leads to the Random Parameters Logit model (RPL)4, which has been applied in 325 

the study because it accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity and allows obtaining the 326 

individual-specific parameter estimates. For more details about the CE technique and the RPL 327 

model, see among others Hensher et al. [52] and Louviere et al. [53]. 328 

 329 

3.4. The relative importance of biodiesel attributes and levels 330 

From the RPL model estimates in the traditional discrete choice experiment, the marginal 331 

rate of substitution (MRS) between attributes is usually calculated. Because one of the 332 

attributes is expressed in monetary terms, it is possible to determine the implicit price (IP) of 333 

the attributes. However, in this study, we use the marginal utilities estimates ( )k  attached to 334 

the levels of the attributes to calculate the global utility (i.e., the relative importance) of each 335 

attribute ( )kI  and their levels ( )klI . Regarding the attributes, the ratio of the particular estimate 336 

to the sum of all the estimates of a specific attribute is used to reveal its relative importance as 337 

stated by Smith [54] and, Green and Rao [55]:  338

4 We started by estimating a conditional logit model. However, the result of the Hausmann-MacFadden test demonstrates the 
violation of the IIA property (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives) known as Luce’s axiom [56] which implies that the ratio 
of the probabilities of choosing any pair of alternatives i and j is not dependent on the systematic utility of any other alternative 
within the set of presented alternatives. Thus, we specified the different types of model that relax the IIA, of which the RPL 
have demonstrated the best goodness of fit.

the attribute (i.e., the most preferred level), and (min )k  is the minimum utility (i.e., the least 341 

preferred level). 342 

Concerning the levels, it is necessary to distinguish between the positive (preferred) and 343 

negative (non-preferred) levels (i.e., the levels with a positive contribution to the utility function 344 

with a positive estimate ( 0)k   (hereafter, k

(hereafter, k

3.5. The joint use of the CE and CV: decomposing the WTP 349

. Decomposing the value of a “complex good” into different values of their attributes and levels 352 

is not new. Kallas and Gil [57] and Kallas et al. [42] decomposed the value of complex goods 353 

(agricultural multifunctionality and rabbit meat) using the CV and the relative importance of the 354 

attributes and levels obtained from the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). However, in their 355 

procedure they assumed positive utilities for the attribute levels, which is rather restrictive. 356 

Thus, to alleviate this drawback, in this paper we propose the use of the CE instead of the AHP 357 

to obtain the relative importance of the attribute and attribute levels. Following the basic model 358 

presented by Kallas and Gil [57], the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for the shift from “do 359 

not choose” to “choose” a preferred scenario can be decomposed into the maximum WTP of 360 

their descriptors (i.e., the attributes and attribute levels) using their relative importance (I). 361 

Thus, the WTP for the k-th attribute is given by: 362 

1k k Si kWTP I WTP where I      (5) 363 

where the WTPSi refers to the willingness to pay for the chosen scenario. 364 

For the attribute levels, we should distinguish between the preferred ( 0)k
   and the 365 

non-preferred levels ( 0)k
  . In the case of the preferred levels, their WTP ( )

calculated by multiplying the positive value of the k-th attribute WTP ( kWTP ) by their relative 367

4. Results and discussion 378 

4.1. Sample description 379 

The sample consisted of 300 diesel car owners/users over 18 years old who regularly 380 

purchase fuels. Most of the respondents were male (72, 33%), aged between 30 and 44 years 381 

and living in three-member households. More than half of the participants had university-level 382 

studies and were employees with an average income between 1000 and 2500€ per month. 383 

The consumers were asked to state how much money they spent on fuels per week and 384 

whether they paid for the fuels by themselves. The answers indicated that the majority of 385 

respondents paid by themselves, and 53% of respondents spent 1-25€ in fuels per week, while 386 

the average consumption is 32.06€ per week. The next questions referred to the year the 387 

respondents bought the car and their average fuel consumption per 100 km. Half of the 388 

respondents (51.5%) had cars registered after 2006, 37.1% registered their vehicles in the 389 

period between 2000 and 2005, while a small percentage of respondents (11.3%) had old cars 390 

registered before 1999. The average fuel consumption was 6.49 litres per 100 km. 391 

 392 

4.2. Attitudes and opinions toward biodiesel 393 

The actual consumption of biodiesel among respondents was very low, with only 1% of 394 

respondents using biodiesel always, and 16% of them using it occasionally. The consumers 395 

who have never or almost never used biodiesel were asked to indicate their reasons for such 396 

behaviour. The main reason was “not recommended by their vehicle manufacturer” (20.8%) 397 

followed by “I had never thought in using it” (20.4%). The fact that biodiesel is not available in 398 

most of the petrol stations was also an important reason (18.4%). Although biodiesel is cheaper 399 

or approximately the same price to conventional fuel in the area of Barcelona, 12.4 % of the 400 



14 
 

respondents answered that they did not use it because it is more expensive. “I do not trust its 401 

reliability” and “I do not think that there is any difference from the conventional” comprise 9.2% 402 

and 0.8%, respectively. 403 

Nearly all of the respondents (91.7%) were familiar with the existence of biodiesel. 404 

Although the percentage was significantly high, when consumers were asked to indicate two 405 

crops that are used for its production, a significant percentage could not indicate any (48.7%). 406 

The others mostly stated that biodiesel is produced from corn (16.3%), sunflower oil (11.7%) 407 

or rapeseed (10.7%). In this context, the consumers were asked to indicate the percentage of 408 

the mixture between conventional diesel and biodiesel allowed in the market in Spain; 18.3% 409 

of the respondents answered the question correctly (10-30% of the mixture). However, the 410 

majority of the respondents (81.7%) wrongly answered, or they did not know. 411 

Participants were also asked to assess various statements related to certain 412 

characteristics of biodiesel. The evaluation was on a scale of 0 “I strongly disagree” to 10 “I 413 

strongly agree”. The respondents agreed with the notion that biodiesel releases less pollutants 414 

than conventional diesel, with an average of 6.81. They also agreed that biodiesel will make 415 

the country less dependent on fossil fuels. However, the respondents did not agree that the 416 

number of kilometres travelled using biodiesel is greater than that of conventional diesel, with 417 

an average of 4.55.  418 

Finally, the environmental issues related to biodiesel and other renewable energy were 419 

analysed. Consumers were asked to rate from 0 to 10 the respect for the environment of the 420 

different energy sources. Solar energy and wind energy were evaluated as the most 421 

environmentally friendly energy sources, with an average of 8.43 and 8.2, respectively. 422 

Hydraulic energy was close, with an average 7.61. However, the respondents evaluated 423 

natural gas and biodiesel at a lower range, with 5.57 and 5.44, respectively. The low mean of 424 

biodiesel may indicate that consumers do not consider biodiesel as a clear alternative energy 425 

source, as it received a lower value than natural gas. The average level of respect for the fossil 426 

fuels was 4.2 for conventional diesel and 3.64 for gasoline. Finally, nuclear energy received a 427 

3.14 and thus is considered to be the least satisfactory energy for the environment. 428 

 429 

4.3. The CE results 430 

First, we started by checking for the IIA property. The results from the Hausman-431 

McFadden test for both subsamples indicated that the IIA property does not hold for the 432 

conditional logit model (2= 32.8752 with a p-value = .0000 for the first subsample and 433 

2=67.8044 with a p-value =.0000 for subsample 2). Thus, the RPL model will better fit our 434 

data set. Table 3 presents the results of the RPL model for both samples. As can be observed, 435 

at the 99% confidence level, we can reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are jointly 436 



15 
 

equal to zero. We thus do not reject the overall significance of the model. The results exhibited 437 

an acceptable range of goodness of fit through McFadden’s pseudo-R2 value (0.256 and 0.226, 438 

respectively). It also exhibited a satisfactory value of the predicted percentage of the correct 439 

classification (78.5% and 76.9%, respectively). For the estimation of the random parameters, 440 

we assumed that the attribute coefficients were normally distributed, as they better fit our stated 441 

data. 442 

The positive or negative sign of the parameters indicates a positive or negative 443 

contribution to the utility function. Thus, in both samples, diesel car users primarily prefer to 444 

refuel in their habitual route and at the local petrol station. The results also indicate that in both 445 

cases the respondents demonstrate a rejection of biodiesel in all its proposed mixture. This 446 

non-acceptance of biodiesel is more accentuated when its production may increase the price 447 

of bread. The standard deviations of almost all random parameters are significant, confirming 448 

the suitability of the specification of this model to our data. 449

To better understand the relative importance of all levels of the attributes, it is important 453 

to calculate the utility of the base levels because they are not directly estimated from the model. 454 

The coefficients of the reference level of each attribute are obtained following the coding effect 455 

procedure. Thus, 0  is calculated as -1 P , where P  is the number of the total levels of each 456 

attribute. For the significance of the values, we employed the Krinsky and Robb method [58] 457 

for 1000 random repetitions. The results are displayed in Table 4. 458

4.4. The WTP of the attributes and levels 463 

The relative importance of the attributes and levels are displayed in Table 5. The results 464 

indicated that for sample 1, the most important attribute was the ‘location of the petrol station’ 465 

followed by the ‘type of diesel’ and the “type of the petrol station”. For sample 2, the 466 

respondents demonstrated the same preferences pattern. However, as expected, they 467 

exhibited the highest relative importance for “bread price”. These values were used for the 468 

decomposition of the WTP of the preferred scenarios into the WTPs of the attributes and levels. 469 

As observed, the participants from the first sample demonstrated a willingness to pay 0.81€ 470 

for the location of the petrol station, 0.37€ for the type of diesel and a non-significant 0.02€ for 471 

the type of petrol station. The participants from sample 2 demonstrated the highest WTP for 472 

the attribute “bread price” (0.79€) followed by the location (0.22€), type of diesel (0.15€) and 473 

finally the type of the petrol station (0.12€). 474

In a subsequent step, the previous WTP values attached to the attributes (i.e. kWTP ) 480 

were decomposed into the WTPs of their levels. The procedure and the results are exhibited 481 

in Table 6. In both samples, participants were willing to pay 0.018€ and 0.116€ for the local 482 

petrol station. The respondents also demonstrated a WTP of 0.37€ and 0.106€ for 483 

conventional diesel. However, they were not willing to pay a premium for biodiesel and for the 484 

different proposed mixture. One of the main factor for such rejection is that car manufacturers 485 

do not recommend its use as it may negatively affect the energy efficiency and may cause 486 

engine failure [59]. For the location of the petrol station, diesel car users exhibited a WTP of 487 

0.808€ and 0.223€ if the petrol station is located in their habitual route, being the most 488 

important level in the first sample. Finally, as expected for the attribute of bread price, the 489 

respondents were willing to pay 0.710€ to keep it unchanged (i.e., a 0% increase), being the 490 

most important level. 491

5. Conclusions 496 

In this study, we assessed the consumer preferences toward biodiesel in the transport 497 

sector in Catalonia Spain. The results demonstrated that the Spanish users/owners of diesel 498 

cars are not willing to pay for biodiesel, which seems to be rejected in all the mixtures 499 

proposed; this result is contrary to the results obtained by [6], who confirmed that consumers 500 

are willing to pay 0.08 Euros/litre and [41] who determined that Spanish users of diesel are 501 

willing to pay up to 5% over the price of standard diesel.  502 

The data indicated that in Spain, few manufacturers of cars currently accept the use of 503 

more than B5, while others do not recommend any level of biodiesel to refuel. Vehicle owners 504 

are asked therefore to check the recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer before using 505 

biodiesel, particularly if the vehicle is covered by a new vehicle warranty. For instance, Toyota, 506 

Mercedes Benz and BMW (with the exception of Germany) among other brands do not 507 

recommend the use of biodiesel in their engines. Biodiesel requires certain changes in the 508 

engine, such as the use of synthetic plastics not susceptible to degradation and other specific 509 

materials to be used in the construction of engines and fuel systems [60]. Thus, the term “non-510 

recommended” indicates that any amount of biodiesel can damage the engine, and the owner 511 

may lose the car warranty. However, other brands (for instance, Audi, Ford, Honda, Seat…) 512 

allow the use of a maximum of 5% of the mixture of biodiesel in their engines. 513 

Although all of the respondents were familiar with the existence of biodiesel, they 514 

exhibited a lack of information about its production and its situation in Spain at the moment. 515 

They did not consider biodiesel as a clear environmentally friendly alternative energy in the 516 

transport sector, and thus more studies are needed in the future. Another significant limitation 517 

is the lack of biodiesel availability due to its low market share. At present, there are only 204 518 

petrol stations that offer biodiesel in Spain, which represents a very small portion 519 

(approximately 2%) of the total number of petrol stations. 520 

At the methodological level, our approach demonstrated the capacity to decompose the 521 

WTP associated with any scenario into the WTPs of its attributes and levels using the relative 522 

importance estimated from the CE. However, this approach needs to be validated and 523 

compared with the traditional CE, and it is necessary to test the consistency of the results 524 

obtained. This point is beyond our objective and will be assessed in future research. 525
