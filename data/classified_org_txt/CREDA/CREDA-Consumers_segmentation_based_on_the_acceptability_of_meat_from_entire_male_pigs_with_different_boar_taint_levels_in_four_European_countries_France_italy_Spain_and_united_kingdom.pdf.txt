Abstract  2 

The aim of this work was to conduct consumers' studies based on the acceptability of 3 

pork with different boar taint levels: test 1 performed in Spain (n=126) and United 4 

Kingdom (n=146), and test 2 done in France (n=139) and Italy (n=140). Each test had 3 5 

types of pork: ‘Female meat’, ‘Low boar tainted meat’, and a third type was ‘Medium 6 

boar tainted meat’ or 'High boar tainted meat'. In the two consumer tests, 3 clusters were 7 

identified on the basis of ‘How delicious do you find this meat?’: (1) ‘pork lovers', (2) 8 

‘boar meat lovers’, (3) ‘Reject boar tainted meat’. Additionally, in test 2, a fourth cluster 9 

was identified: 'Reject low tainted meat'. A group of 16.2-38.2 % of consumers rejected 10 

meat from boars was identified, and a group between 12.4-21.7 % rated better the meat 11 

with medium or high levels of boar taint, suggesting that there is a niche for meat from 12 

medium and high levels of boar taint.  13 

 14 

Highlights 15 

 Consumer acceptability of entire male pork at eating. 16 

 A segment of pork lovers, regardless the level of boar taint, has been identified. 17 

 A segment of boar meat lovers has been identified. 18 

 A segment of consumers that reject boar tainted meat has been identified. 19 

 There is a niche for meat from medium and high levels of boar taint. 20 

 Meat classification according to boar taint level is needed to better orientate it. 21

1. Introduction 26 

Nowadays there is a growing concern about the negative effect of surgical castration of 27 

pigs without anaesthesia on animal welfare. In 2008, across Europe the majority of male 28 

piglets intended for pork production were castrated to avoid potential consumer 29 

dissatisfaction because of boar taint. At that time, castration was performed in most of 30 

the EU countries on 80-100% of the male pigs in conventional production, and surgical 31 

castration without anaesthesia was the most common technique (Fredriksen et al., 32 

2009). The exceptions were United Kingdom and Ireland, where castration was hardly 33 

performed, and some southern countries such as Cyprus, Portugal and Spain, where a 34 

limited percentage of the male pigs were castrated in comparison to the other European 35 

countries. Since then, some countries have taken an action to avoid piglet castration 36 

without anaesthesia not only for welfare reasons, but also because the production of 37 

entire male pigs decreases production costs and results in higher meat content of the 38 

carcass (EFSA, 2004; PIGCAS, 2009). Norway and Switzerland have already banned 39 

piglet castration by law, and other countries such as The Netherlands and Germany have 40 

signed letters of intentions (Declaration of Noordwijk 2007 and Düsseldorf Declaration 41 

2008, respectively) which aimed to avoid the need for piglet castration in the long term. 42 

In 2010, at EU level, representatives of European farmers, meat industry, retailers, 43 

scientists, veterinarians and animal welfare NGOs, committed themselves to voluntarily 44 

end surgical castration of pigs in Europe by January 2018 by means of the European 45 

Declaration on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs (DG-SANCO, 2010). 46 

Consequently, entire male production is one of the alternatives and therefore, an 47 

increase in the production of entire males would result in a positive impact on the 48 

production efficiency and carcass composition. But as a consequence, more tainted 49 

carcasses could enter to the meat chain. A number of consumer studies have been 50 

carried out in order to ascertain the acceptability of pork from entire male pigs in 51 

different countries and using different methodologies as was reviewed in (EFSA, 2004) 52 

and more recently, by Font i Furnols (2012). The two main compounds responsible for 53 

boar taint are androstenone (Patterson, 1968) and skatole (Vold, 1970; Walstra & 54 

Maarse, 1970). The respective contributions of these two compounds vary depending on 55 

the characteristics of the meat evaluated, procedures for preparing the meat, the ability 56 

of consumers to perceive androstenone among others, as was been reviewed by Font i 57 



4 
 

Furnols (2012), and also it may vary depending on the habit of eating meat from 58 

castrated or entire male pigs. 59 

Therefore, it would be interesting to study the impact that meat from boars could have 60 

in the European market (Consumer satisfaction), which is traditionally used to eating 61 

meat from castrated pigs, and identify if there is any difference comparing to other 62 

countries where the utilization of entire male pigs is more common. 63 

The present work had two main objectives: 1) to evaluate and update the results on 64 

sensory acceptability of meat from entire male pigs (as an alternative to the production 65 

of castrates), involving four European countries that produce different proportion of 66 

castrated pigs in two consumer studies: Spain (33.2%) and United Kingdom (2.1%), 67 

France (97.5%), and Italy (100%), and 2) to identify potential niche markets for meat 68 

with different boar taint levels. 69 

 70 

2. Materials and methods 71 

2.1 Consumer studies and classification of consumers 72 

Two consumer studies were conducted in two pair of countries where each consumer 73 

assessed pork with various levels of androstenone and skatole. In each study, three 74 

groups of meat samples were assessed:  75 

 Consumer test 1. Pair of countries: Spain (ES, n=133, performed in Barcelona) 76 

and United Kingdom (UK, n=146, performed in Reading); 77 

 Consumer test 2. Pair of countries: France (FR, n= 139, performed in Cain & 78 

Paris) and Italy (IT, n= 140, performed in Matelica & Reggio Emilia); 79 

Considering the two consumer tests, a total of 558 consumers from the two different 80 

pair of European countries participated in this project. They were stratified by age 81 

(according to each country profile) and sex (approximately 50:50 ratio between men and 82 

women). Consumers were required to eat pork on a regular basis. 83 

2.2. Animals and samples 84 

The meat and fat samples used for the consumer studies were obtained from populations 85 

of pigs slaughtered according to commercial practice. They were collected from boars 86 

and gilts in commercial abattoirs from Spain and France. Carcass weights and 87 

genotypes were representative of current practice in these countries. The meat collected 88 

in Spain was used for the consumer studies carried out in ES and UK; and the meat 89 

collected in France was used for the consumer studies carried out in FR and IT.  90 



5 
 

For each consumer test, a minimum 20 loins from gilts, 20 loins from boars with Low 91 

Boar taint (LBT) and 20 loins from boars with Medium Boar taint (MBT) or High Boar 92 

taint (HBT) were selected. From each animal, the muscle Longissimus lumborum (with 93 

the subcutaneous fat) was taken from the 1st lumbar vertebra to the last rib, divided in 94 

two sections (min. 15 cm) and distributed in one of the two countries (Figure 1).  95 

2.3. Androstenone and skatole measurements in fat 96 

Back fat samples were collected on the day of slaughter at the level of the neck, vacuum 97 

packed and deep frozen until analyzed for androstenone (AND) and skatole (SKA). The 98 

determination of SKA levels was performed using HPLC-FLD and the determination of 99 

AND levels using GC-MS (for ES and UK samples, Ampuero et al., (2011)) or by 100 

HPLC-FLD (for FR and IT samples; Pauly, Spring, O'Doherty, Ampuero, & Bee 101 

(2008). Results were expressed as µg/g, on pure fat basis. Meat samples were classified 102 

as FE (meat from gilts), Low boar taint (LBT), Medium boar taint (MBT) or High boar 103 

taint (HBT) depending on the sex and the levels of boar taint compounds (Blanch et al.,  104 

(2012); Table 1). Each consumer test and each session was carried out with 3 samples: 105 

samples from gilts (FE) as a reference, and two more samples with different levels of 106 

boar taint: in consumer test 1 (ES & UK) meat from LBT and MTB was used; and in 107 

consumer test 2 (FR & IT), meat from LBT and HBT. 108 

2.4. Preparation of samples 109 

In each location, loins were defrosted at 2-4 ºC during 24h, and cut into 0.5 cm thick 110 

slices with 5 mm of subcutaneous fat (when it was possible). Each slice was cut in two 111 

pieces, and cooked using a cooking plate at 180ºC (which was greased with maize oil). 112 

A different cooking plate was used for each type of meat presented within a session. 113 

The meat was turned upside down regularly until a core temperature of 80ºC and the 114 

meat was salted after cooking, reproducing home preparation. Samples were then 115 

immediately served to the consumers for evaluation. 116 

2.5. Sensory evaluation of samples 117 

Sessions of 10-12 consumers were organised for meat evaluation. Each consumer 118 

assessed 3 pieces of meat, one from 3 levels of boar taint (Table 1). A 10 minute 119 

interval was used between each of the three samples presented within a session. The 120 

order of presentation of samples was rotated using a partial Latin square design to avoid 121 

any first sample and carry-over effect and the identity of the samples was not given to 122 



6 
 

consumers (Macfie, Bratchell, Greenhoff, & Vallis, 1989). Consumers were asked for 123 

hedonic questions (questions 1 to 4) and intensity evaluations (questions 5-11) as 124 

described in Table 2, using a modified nine-point intensity scale (from 1 to 9). The 125 

intermediate level (5) was not included to stimulate consumers to commit themselves 126 

and not to allow a neutral assessment which is not informative (Guerrero, 1999). The 127 

attributes ‘Delicious’, ‘Odour’ and ‘Taste’ were rated on a scale going from 1 = ‘dislike 128 

very much’ to 9 = ‘like very much’, whereas the attributes ‘Strength of odour’, 129 

‘Abnormal odour’, and ‘Abnormal taste’ were scored between 1 = ‘low perception’ to 9 130 

= ‘strong perception’. 131 

2.6. Description of EU pork consumers. 132 

At the end of the test, consumers also answered socio-demographic questions and 133 

frequency of consumption of different pork products, the most common purchasing 134 

place for fresh pork meat, if they were responsible for buying fresh pork at home, if they 135 

were responsible for cooking at home, and if they usually eat the pork with the fat. 136 

2.7. Statistical analysis 137 

Data analyses were conducted using SAS Statistical Package (SAS Inst., Inc., Cary, NC, 138 

USA, version 9.2). To analyse the parameters regarding classification of consumers 139 

(age, gender, educational level, frequency of consumption of different pork products, 140 

the most common purchasing place for fresh pork meat, if they were responsible for 141 

buying fresh pork at home, if they were responsible for cooking at home, and if they 142 

usually eat the pork with the fat), FREQ and GENMOD procedures were applied. The 143 

MIXED procedure was used to analyse the acceptability of odour and flavour by 144 

consumers: the model included the type of animal, sensitivity to AND and their 145 

interaction as fixed effects, session as blocking variable and consumer as random effect. 146 

Only the significant (P<0.05) interactions were kept in the model. Differences were 147 

declared at P<0.05 and tendencies at P<0.10. 148 

In order to establish different clusters of consumers a hierarchical cluster analysis was 149 

performed with the CLUSTER procedure and the Ward method. The cluster analysis 150 

was conducted on the basis of the attribute 'delicious'.  151 

For each cluster, the MIXED procedure was then used to analyse the hedonic attributes 152 

(delicious, odour, taste, and in-mouth feeling) and the intensity attributes (strength of 153 

odour and strength of taste, abnormal odour and abnormal taste) scored by the 154 

consumers. The model included the type of animal and country as fixed effects, session 155 



7 
 

as blocking effect and consumer as random effect. The interaction Type of animal and 156 

Country was removed of the model because it was not significant (P<0.05). Differences 157 

were also declared at P<0.05. 158 

 159 

3. Results  160 

3.1. Description of consumers 161 

The description of consumers according to the gender, age and educational level is 162 

described in Table 3. A total of 558 consumers participated in the two consumer studies 163 

(consumer test 1: n=279; consumer test 2: n=279). In each one, the proportion of men 164 

and woman was around 50 % (consumer test 1: 52 %; consumer test 2: 62 %). 165 

In consumer test 1 (ES & UK), 15, 25, 41 and 19 % of the consumers were 18-25, 26-166 

40, 41-60 and > 60 % of age respectively; and in consumer test 2 (FR & UK), 12, 27, 51 167 

and 10 % of the consumers were 18-25, 26-40, 41-60 and > 60 % of age respectively. 168 

3.2. Habits of European consumers regarding pork consumption 169 

In general, over ninety percent of consumers ate fresh pork > 2 times/week (ES 95.5 %; 170 

UK 97.3 %; IT 92.9 %) except for FR (34.8 %). The most consumed product was dry 171 

cured ham in ES and IT, cooked ham in FR, and sliced bacon in UK (Figure 2).  172 

In general, the percentage of respondents responsible for buying fresh pork in their 173 

household was 86.4 % (Table 4). In all countries, women were more responsible for 174 

buying fresh pork than men, and they were mostly between 41-60 years old. Eighty-175 

eight percent of respondents were partially responsible for cooking at home. Women 176 

were more responsible for cooking at home than men. France was an exception, where 177 

percentages were very similar 49.6 % women and 50.4 % men cooked at home. 178 

Considering all respondents, 43.5 % use to eat the pork with the fat in all the countries 179 

(36.4 % of women and 53.1 % of men). Considering the place of purchasing fresh pork 180 

meat, the supermarket was the most common one, followed by the butcher and finally 181 

the traditional market.  182 

3.3. Sensory evaluation 183 

The hedonic evaluation of in-mouth feeling and of the intensity of salty, meaty and fatty 184 

tastes did not result in any consistent difference between meat sample groups and it is 185 

not presented. 186 



8 
 

3.3.1 Differences between meat sample groups, within experiments. 187 

Table 5 shows significance levels within a consumer test: Consumer test 1 carried out in 188 

Spain and United Kingdom, and Consumer test 2 carried out in France and Italy. 189 

Results showed that no significant interaction between the boar taint level and the 190 

country in each consumer test. 191 

In consumer test 1 (ES & UK), significant differences (P<0.05) were observed for the 192 

hedonic attributes assessed by the consumers (delicious, odour and taste). In all the 193 

cases, the score given to the meat from FE and MBT was significantly higher (more 194 

favourable) than the one given to the meat from LBT (Table 6). With regard to the 195 

intensity evaluations, significant differences were observed between type of meat when 196 

considering strength of odour and strength of taste (P<0.05) whereas no differences 197 

were observed when taking into account the attributes abnormal odour and abnormal 198 

taste. Results showed that the strongest odour was observed in MBT and FE meat, and 199 

the highest strength of taste was observed in MBT in comparison to LBT.  200 

In consumer test 2 (FR & IT), significant differences (P<0.05) were observed for the 201 

hedonic delicious, odour and taste (Table 7). For all of them, HBT meat was rated worst 202 

(lower scores) than FE meat. Considering the intensity scores, significant differences 203 

(P<0.05) were observed for the attributes strength of taste and abnormal taste. In both 204 

cases, HBT received the highest score (strongest taste and abnormal taste). 205 

3.3.2. Consumer segmentation in consumer test 1: Spain and United Kingdom 206 

Due to the fact that the interaction between Type of meat and Country was not 207 

significant, results are presented considering consumers from the two countries 208 

together.  A total of three clusters were identified on the basis of 'how delicious do you 209 

find this meat'. Figure 3 shows least square means and standard error of the scores that 210 

consumers gave to each attribute (hedonic attributes: delicious, odour and taste; 211 

intensity attributes: strength of odour and strength of taste) and each type of meat (FE, 212 

LBT, MBT), for each cluster identified: 213 

 The first cluster (n=169, 62.1 % of the sample; 57.4 % from Barcelona and 42.6 % 214 

from Reading) comprises respondents that gave high scores to all types of samples. 215 

These consumers were labelled as ‘Pork lovers’.  216 

 The second cluster (n=59, 21.7 % of the sample; 30.5 % from Barcelona and 69.5 % 217 

from Reading) comprises respondents that liked the boar taint and therefore, the 218 



9 
 

higher the level of boar taint, the higher the score to the attribute. These consumers 219 

were considered as ‘Boar meat lovers’. 220 

 The third cluster (n=44, 16.2 % of the sample; 25.0 % from Barcelona and 75.0 % 221 

from Reading) comprises respondents that did not liked the boar taint and therefore, 222 

the higher the level of boar taint, the lower the score to the attribute ‘Delicious’. 223 

These consumers were labelled as ‘Reject boar tainted meat’. 224 

The three clusters did not display any relevant difference on the basis of demographic 225 

data variable (age, gender and educational level). 226 

3.3.3. Consumer segmentation in consumer test 2: France and Italy 227 

As observed in consumer test 1, due to the fact that the interaction between Type of 228 

meat and Country was not significant, results are presented considering consumers from 229 

the two countries together.  In this consumer test, a total of four clusters were identified 230 

on the basis of 'how delicious do you find this meat' (Figure 4). 231 

 The first cluster (n=136, 49.5 % of the sample; 57.4 % from France and 42.6 % 232 

from Italy) comprises respondents that gave high scores to all types of samples. 233 

These consumers were labelled as ‘Pork lovers’. 234 

 The second cluster (n=34, 12.4 % of the sample; 23.5 % from France and 76.5 % 235 

from Italy) comprises respondents that liked the boar taint and therefore, the higher 236 

the level of boar taint, the higher the score to the attribute. These consumers were 237 

considered as ‘Boar meat lovers’. 238 

 The third cluster (n=55, 20.0 % of the sample; 49.1 % from France and 50.9 % from 239 

Italy) comprises respondents that did not liked the HBT meat and therefore, the 240 

higher the level of boar taint, the lower the score to the attribute ‘Delicious’. These 241 

consumers were labelled as ‘Reject boar tainted meat’. 242 

 The fourth cluster (n=50, 18.2 % of the sample; 52.0 % from France and 48.0 % 243 

from Italy) comprises respondents that gave low scores to the meat with LBT. These 244 

consumers were labelled as ‘Reject low boar tainted meat’. 245 

 246 

4. Discussion  247 

In the present paper, two consumer studies were carried out with the aim to ascertain 248 

consumer acceptability of boar meat with different levels of boar taint. Due to practical 249 

reasons, meat was collected in Spain and France, chemically analysed in terms of 250 

androstenone and skatole levels, and then distributed to two other countries: meat from 251 



10 
 

Spain was used for the consumer test for Spain and United Kingdom, and meat from 252 

France was used for the consumer test carried out in France and Italy. It is interesting to 253 

highlight that, consumer test 1 was planned in two countries where, as pointed out by 254 

Frederiksen et al. (2009), were used to the commercialization of meat from entire male 255 

pigs, whereas consumer test 2 was carried out in two countries where consumers were 256 

not used to this type of meat: in 2008, the percentage of production of castrated male 257 

pigs was estimated as 33.2 % in ES, 2.1 % in UK, 97.5 % in FR and 100 % in IT.  258 

It is also interesting to point out that, in the two consumer studies, consumers were able 259 

to taste meat from entire male pigs with such low levels of boar taint comparable to the 260 

levels found in meat from gilts (Bonneau & Chevillon, 2012; type of meat LBT - low 261 

boar taint- and FE - meat from gilts). Additionally, each study had a third type of meat 262 

with medium levels (MBT in study 1) or high levels (HBT in study 2) of boar taint. 263 

4.1. Methodology used 264 

As reviewed by Font i Furnols (2012), the methodologies used in the already published 265 

papers are very diverse and therefore, it is difficult to compare the results among them. 266 

Issues such as type of meat (loin slices, chops, cutlets, mince meat, fat, bacon, dry cured 267 

ham...), location of the test (hall or home test), cooking procedure (including cooking 268 

device, cooking time and temperature), type of meat samples (meat from gilts, castrated 269 

pigs and/or from entire male pigs), level of boar taint in the assessed meat, and the type 270 

of attributes and scales used during the consumer test are only some examples. As stated 271 

in the methodology section, in this paper we used meat from the Longissimus lumborum 272 

muscle from the 1st lumbar vertebra to the last rib, and on the day of the consumer test, 273 

the meat was cut into 0.5 cm thick slices with a maximum of 5 mm of subcutaneous fat.  274 

The acceptance of boar meat is assumed to be dependent on the sample preparation and 275 

presentation. In this study, meat samples were cooked on a hot plate and were served 276 

uncovered to the participants to simulate a meal at home. This kind of preparation is not 277 

very common in previously published papers although it is very similar to the type of 278 

preparation that consumers usually do at home. Since AND and SKA are predominantly 279 

released during heating (Lunde et al., 2008), the intensity of these volatile compounds is 280 

expected to be higher during the preparation than at consumption. In our study, 281 

consumers were not involved in the cooking process. Therefore, due to the fact that the 282 

meat came from a very lean piece of meat, the thickness of the sample and the fact that 283 



11 
 

it was served uncovered, the methodology used in the present paper could minimize the 284 

perception of boar taint. 285 

4.2. Overall acceptability 286 

Taking into account that different methodologies have been used in the already 287 

published consumer tests carried out in different countries (reviewed by Font i Furnols 288 

(2012), results obtained in a given country cannot be extrapolated to another one. The 289 

present paper, however, provides the results from 4 countries using the same 290 

methodology. 291 

In terms of hedonic assessment, in consumer test 1 (ES & UK) meat with low levels of 292 

boar taint (LBT) was worst rated than meat with medium boar taint levels (MBT). 293 

Considering consumer test 2 (FR & IT), meat with high levels of boar taint (HBT) was 294 

worst rated than meat from female (FE), and meat with low levels of boar taint (LBT) 295 

was scored in between. In the two countries were consumers are used to eating boar 296 

meat (consumer test 1) the meat with medium levels of boar taint was scored better than 297 

the meat with low levels of boar taint, whereas in the two countries were consumers 298 

were not used to eating meat from entire male pigs (consumer test 2), the higher the 299 

level of boar taint, the worst score given by the consumers. Since the results obtained 300 

were not conclusive, the need of an extra statistical analyses was identified.  301 

To the best of our knowledge, the cluster analyses with the aim to identify consumers 302 

segmentation based on the question 'How delicious do you find this meat (with different 303 

levels of boar taint)' has not been applied yet. So far, consumer segmentation was 304 

identified on the basis of the sensitivity test described by (Weiler et al., 2000) based on 305 

smelling crystals of pure androstenone. 306 

4.3. Consumer segmentation based on the hedonic attribute Deliciousnes  307 

To identify the existence of market segmentation, a hierarchical cluster analysis was 308 

conducted for each consumer test. As a result, similar cluster solution was identified as 309 

best explaining data for each consumer study. Three groups or clusters were identified 310 

in consumer test 1 (ES & UK), and four in consumer test 2 (FR & IT). Interestingly, 311 

although the boar taint level of the most tainted type of meat (Table 1) was different in 312 

the two studies, clusters with similar behaviour were observed: the first three clusters 313 

identified were labelled as Pork lovers, Boar meat lovers and Reject boar tainted meat:  314 

 Cluster 1 (Pork lovers) rated the three types of meat with relatively high scores (all 315 

of them over 5 in a 9-point scale). This cluster represents 62.1 % of the sample in 316 



12 
 

consumer test 1, and 49.5 % of the sample in consumer test 2. In both cases, 317 

compared to the other clusters identified, this one comprises the higher percentage of 318 

consumers. Despite the fact that significant differences between the type of meat 319 

have been observed in the different attributes in both studies, it is remarkable that all 320 

the scores were relatively high. This segment of consumers was found in the two 321 

consumer tests, despite the levels of boar taint in the type of meats assessed. In the 322 

case of consumer study 1 (ES & UK), scores given to the LBT meat was 323 

significantly lower (worst score, but still over 5 in the 9-point scale) than the meat 324 

from FE and MBT, which could explain the results when considering the overall 325 

acceptability. 326 

 Cluster 2 (Boar meat lovers) rated the meat from gilt (FE) with lower scores, and the 327 

meat with MBT or HBT with higher scores. Meat with LBT was scored in-between 328 

in both cases. This cluster represents 21.7 % of the sample in consumer test 1, and 329 

12.4 % of the sample in consumer test 2. The lower percentage of consumers that are 330 

part of this cluster in study 2 may be explained because the highest level of boar taint 331 

meat was higher in comparison to the levels in consumer study 1. In fact, it is 332 

reported that some of the sensitive consumers like the androstenone smell and it 333 

influences their scores (Blanch et al., 2012; Bonneau & Chevillon, 2012; Font i 334 

Furnols, Gispert, Diestre, & Oliver, 2003). 335 

 In cluster 3 (Reject boar tainted meat) meat from gilt received the highest (best) 336 

score in both consumer tests, while meat with medium levels (MBT in study 1) or 337 

high levels (HBT in study 2) received the lowest (worst) score. This cluster 338 

represents 16.2 % of the sample for the consumer test 1, and 20.0 % of the sample in 339 

consumer test 2. These results are also in line to the results obtained in cluster 2. 340 

Since the levels of boar taint were higher in consumer test 2, and due to the fact that 341 

the consumers that tasted this meat were not used to boar meat, it was expected to 342 

find a higher percentage of consumers rejecting the boar tainted meat. It is interesting 343 

to highlight that the type of meat scored below 5 (in a 9-point scale) was HBT for 344 

consumer test 2, and MBT for consumer test 1. In both cases, the meat with LBT was 345 

scored in-between, but with scores around 5. Therefore, these consumers rejected 346 

meat with medium or high boar taint, but not the type of meat with low boar taint.  347 

 348 

Additionally, in consumer test 2 (FR & IT) there was a fourth cluster identified and 349 

labelled as consumers that Reject low boar tainted meat, representing 18.2 % of the 350 



13 
 

sample. In this one, the meat with low boar taint received the lowest (worst) score in all 351 

the attributes (between 4.3 and 5.1). The identification of this cluster could be expected 352 

if we take into account that it has been found in the two countries were consumers are 353 

not used to the meat from entire male pigs. 354 

Considering the percentage of consumers being part of each cluster (Figure 5), a 355 

percentage of 16.2 % (from cluster 3) in consumer study 1 (ES & UK) and 38.2 % 356 

(from cluster 3 plus 4) in consumer study 2 (FR & IT) could react negatively when 357 

eating meat from entire male pigs. Again, to understand these differences two facts 358 

should take into account: (i) meat with boar taint used in FR and IT had higher boar 359 

taint levels than the meat used for ES and UK, and (ii) consumers from FR and IT were 360 

not used to eat meat from entire male pigs. (Diestre, Oliver, Gispert, Arpa, & Arnau, 361 

1990) stated that androstenone might not be a problem in countries where the 362 

production of young animals is common. Results from the present paper disagree on 363 

that statement since cluster 3 was identified in the four countries involved, which 364 

slaughter pigs at very different carcass weight (in 2009, FR: 80 kg; ES: 82kg and UK: 365 

80kg; and in IT: 125kg, which corresponds exclusively to castrated pigs-; 366 

EUROSTAT).   367 

 368 

4. Conclusions and implications 369 

The present study shows that, when eating fresh pork (loin 0.5 cm thick with 5 mm back 370 

fat, cooked in a hot plate and served uncovered), different groups of consumers could be 371 

identified on the basis of 'How delicious do you find this meat'. Among them, a group of 372 

consumers that like pork meat (49.5 - 62.1% of the participants), a group of consumers 373 

that prefer meat with boar taint (12.4 - 21.7 %) and a group of consumers that reject 374 

boar tainted meat (16.2 - 20.0 %) has been identified. Results suggest that there is a 375 

group of consumers may reject meat with boar taint, but there is also a niche for meat 376 

from medium and high levels of boar taint in the cities studied. Therefore, the present 377 

research identifies a need to develop tools to select and classify carcasses on the basis of 378 

boar taint level. This situation can influence pork consumption so that it might 379 

guarantee that consumers do not purchase pork with inadequate sensory quality.  380
