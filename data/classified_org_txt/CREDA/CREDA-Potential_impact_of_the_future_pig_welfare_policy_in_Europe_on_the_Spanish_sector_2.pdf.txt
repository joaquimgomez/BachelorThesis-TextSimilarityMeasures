ANIMAL WELFARE is becoming a relevant FACTOR affecting CONSUMER PREFERENCES.
Consumers are DEMANDING animals being reared, fed and housed AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE as they would in their NATURAL CONDITIONS.
1. INTRODUCTION: Background
The growing CONCERNS about ANIMAL WELFARE in EU are being extensively debated, resulting in CONTINUOUS CHANGES in regulations and POLICIES.

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 



1. INTRODUCTION: Background
EU regulations have led to BANS of a number of INTENSIVE farming methods.
In this context, PIG WELFARE has received and is still receiving special attention as pork is the MOST PRODUCED and consumed meat in the EU.
For instance, the Council Directive 2008/120/EC has BANNED the use of SOW STALLS by January 2012.

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 


About 97.6 million pigs (79.3% of the total EU pig production) are CASTRATED in the EU, 48.7% of which were surgically CASTRATED WITHOUT ANAESTHESIA
1. INTRODUCTION: Background
Castration can be LEGALLY performed without anaesthetics during the first SEVEN days after birth
After that should only be performed under
     ANAESTHESIA and must include a prolonged
    ANALGESIA by a VETERINARIAN

There is an associated MEAT (sensory) QUALITY problem

BOAR TAINT
Off-odour and  flavour related  to the accumulation of Androstenone and Skatole in the fat tissue


Consumers REACT DIFFERENTLY to this SMELL and therefore it can affect CONSUMERS’ ACCEPTABILITY of pork
CASTRATION of ENTIRE MALES’ pigs is carried out:
To ENCOURAGE the DEPOSIT OF INTRAMUSCULAR FAT
To PREVENT aggressive BEHAVIOR problems
To AVOID the RISK of obtaining meat with BOAR TAINT
1. INTRODUCTION: Background


We all know that surgical castration of entire male pigs has been carried out for many ages in order to encourage the deposit of fat and prevent aggressive behaviour problems. Moreover, specially in high life weight productions systems, it is also carried out to avoid the risk of obtaining meat with boar taint. 

The boar taint is and off-odour and flavour related to the presence of Androstenone and Skatole. These compounds, specially Androstenone, can be accumulated in the fat tissue of the entire male pigs.
Moreover, it is interesting to highlight that only those consumers genetically determined can smell it, and they may react differently. This means that some consumers simply can not smell it, others can smell it and like smell, and some others can smell it and do not like it, so that they can reject the meat.

Therefore, there is an associated meat quality problem related to the castration of pigs.

Many alternatives to AVOID CASTRATION have been explored
Genetic SELECTION and gender selection for ‘low-taint’ pigs
Different MANAGEMENT and rearing strategies 
Slaughter at a YOUNGER age and lower weight 
DETECTION of boar taint at slaughter line
MIXING of tainted with untainted meat 
MASKING unpleasant odours and flavours with the appropriate masking strategy such as spices, marinades or heat treatment.
If the castration is applied, the IMMUNOCASTRATION

The wine sector in Catalonia, as in overall Spain, represents an important fraction of its agriculture and food industry. 


1. INTRODUCTION: Background
Focusing only on the CONSUMERS’ PREFERENCES gives only a PARTIAL VIEW OF THE PROBLEM.
The consumer FINAL CHOICE of a food product is a MIXTURE between the SENSORY EXPERIENCE (Intrinsic cues) and the other descriptors of the products  (Extrinsic cues).
The opinions and attitudes of SPANISH STAKEHOLDERS from the whole pork CHAIN regarding this POLICY CHANGE



Paper prepared for presentation at the X CONGRESO NACIONAL DE ECONOMÍA AGRARIA
Córdoba, 9-11 de Septiembre 2015  "Alimentación y territorios sostenibles desde el sur de Europa"

Thus, the objective of this paper is twofold:
To assess STAKEHOLDERS’ OPINIONS and ATTITUDES of the Spanish pork supply chain towards the potential market of the production of entire male pigs and the impact of a potential mandatory banning of piglet castration.
To analyze the DETERMINANTS FACTORS of fresh meat PURCHASING for BUTCHERS, as the main retailers in the Spanish pork chain supply

2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
4 FOCUS GROUPS (26 participants) as a QUALITATIVE METHOD were applied to analyze OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES.

A FACE-TO-FACE SURVEY of 127 butcheries in Madrid and Barcelona was carried out to identify the determining FACTORS FOR PURCHASING PIG MEAT, using the ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP).

Participants believed that in Spain there would be NO IMPORTANT IMPLICATION since a LARGE PART of the market is already based on entire males.
BOAR TAINT IS SELDOM FOUND in the fresh meat due to the fact that animals in Spain are slaughtered at an EARLY AGE (6 months old) and that GENETIC TYPES have changed
Serious problem for the IBERIAN PIG SECTOR.

In PROCESSED PRODUCTS because it is easier to mask it.
Participants agreed that Spanish CONSUMERS ARE NOT READY to pay a PREMIUM for meat coming from animals raised under HIGHER WELFARE STANDARD CONDITIONS because animal welfare is a comparatively recent issue in Spain.

Los consumidores en España aún NO ESTÁN PREPARADOS para pagar realmente por el bienestar animal. Lo que pagan ahora son una minoría.
El consumidor NO QUIERE Y NO ASOCIA el animal con la carne. (Corderito del Norit con la paletilla).
NO CASTRAR nos cargamos los productos de Calidad

4. RESULTS




Results are in ACCORDANCE TO WHAT OBTAINED from the focus groups. Butchers prefer meat from FEMALE pigs with an AVERAGED FAT CONTENT in particular, intramuscular.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The ban of PIGLET CASTRATION in Europe by 2018 might not be considered a problem since already some percentage of entire males is currently produced.
Boar taint is not present in almost all fresh meat product
Slaughtered at lower age
Boar tainted processed product
However, for the production of high quality products, mainly the Iberian breed should be allowed in order to obtain an adequate INTRAMUSCULAR FAT CONTENT and to avoid boar taint
