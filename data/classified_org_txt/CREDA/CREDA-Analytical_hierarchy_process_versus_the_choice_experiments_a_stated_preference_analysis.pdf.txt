ABSTRACT

Our paper tries to compare individuals’ preferences for attributes and levels of an agro-food product using two different methodologies. A key question is to know if asking consumer what they “prefer” or what they “buy” would lead to different results. In this context we realized an empirical comparison using two different methodologies; the Choice Experiments (CE) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The use of both methods is justified by their capacity to simulate the “purchasing” and “theoretical” stated preferences respectively. Restaurateur’s preference to include rabbit meat in their menus in Catalonia (Spain) has been taken to realize an exploratory study. At the aggregated results, attributes and levels preferences are found to be similar with a 56.6% of a correct rank score from both methods.

Keywords: Choice Experiments, Analytical Hierarchy Process, Consumer preferences.
