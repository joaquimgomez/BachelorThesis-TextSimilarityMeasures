THE ROLE OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE ON SPANISH CONSUMER’S WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCED FOOD 
Jessica Avitia, Montserrat Costa Font, José M. Gil, Jayson L. Lusk and Gemma Echeverria.

INTRODUCTION
	During the last century European agriculture has intensified its production.
	Yields have been increased with some environmental side effects (contamination of surface and ground water and loss of biodiversity due to the reduction of natural habitats) 
	Recently, society is gaining consciousness on the effects of intensive farm production.
	Consumers are increasing their interest towards alternative farming practices such as organic agriculture, placing sustainable agriculture as an interesting alternative for consumption (Chen, 2007). 



*




Introduction
Sustainable Farming
	Two main systems in Spain: integrated and organic farming. 
	Balance food production, profitability, safety, animal welfare, social responsibility and environmental care.




Introduction
Common elements
Differences
	Avoid adverse contributions to the environment. 
	High-animal welfare standards 
	High quality products

	I: Combines the use of biological controls for pest control with traditional techniques based on agrochemicals.  
	O: Prohibits the use of synthetic agrochemicals.

 (Miret, 2004)



Organic  Food  production 
	Worldwide land devoted to organic farming has experienced and important growth during the last decade, with a total of 37.5 million hectares of agricultural land devoted to organic production in 2009. 
	Within Europe the country with more hectares dedicated to organic production is Spain with more than 25,000 producers (FiBL, 2010). 

Integrated Food  production 
	Integrated farming is not considered by any European regulation; therefore each member state has its own regulation.
	According to a survey done in 2010 by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, the nation dedicates 601,394 hectares to integrated production

Introduction



Organic  Food  consumption 
	Europe domestic sales of organic food and feed in 2008 was estimated at 18 billion Euros.
	 Germany (almost 6 billion Euros) U.K. (about 2 billion Euros), France (more than 3 billion Euros) and Italy (1.5 billion Euros) (Willer, 2011). 
	The opposite happens in the Spanish case with a value of only 905 million Euros. 
	 Italy and Spain concentrate more than the 87% of the European export market for organic food and feed (FiBL, 2010). 

Integrated Food  consumption 
	There isn’t any available data about market value and commercialisation of integrated products in Spain.

Research objective 
	

	A better understanding of Spanish consumers’ choices regarding sustainable produced food is needed. 
	Determinants of consumers’ behavior towards food mainly depend on:




Research objective 
	Assess the influence of “experience information” in forming consumers WTP for a sustainable food (trust assets) and to value the trade-off with the “search information” attribute of agro-ecosystem preservation.
	
	This is the first attempt to combine both experiments, WTP and sensory tests for the case of sustainable food. Previously, Poole and Martínez (2006 and 2007) and Combris et al. (2009) showed the importance of experience attributes on individuals quality perception of food and on the final food choice. 



Research design



THE PRODUCT
Product of study : “Golden Delicious” apples 
	All fruits were harvested by a single producer from the area of Lleida, between December 2009 and January 2010.
	Maturity was determined at harvest.
	Apples were placed in cool storage at 0 ºC for up to 10 weeks. 
	Prior to consumer evaluation, the fruits were removed from storage and stored at room temperature of approximately 15º C for up two days.

CONCLUSIONS
	In relation to the sensory analysis, results indicate that the sample can be segregated in two groups. The first one prefers the sensorial attributes associate to sustainable produced apples while a second group prefers attributes associated to conventional apples.
	Our results of the differences in the WTP for sustainable produced apples before (ex-ante) and after (ex-post) the sensory test shown that both “search” and sensory “experience” (appearance) information do have an impact on defining consumers purchase behavior towards sustainable produced food.




CONCLUSIONS
	Our results indicates that Spanish consumers’ general attitude towards organic production seems to be positive in response to trust on organic, environmental and health concern. 

	Our study reveals that in a pre-purchasing situation, the role of “search” information is the most important factor defining consumers’ food choice towards sustainable produced food. 

	Respondents have relatively good knowledge toward organic production but there exists a lack of knowledge in regard to integrated production.

Consumers’ willingness to pay is assessed through an experimental
auction.

 

 

Two auctions have been designed: the first consists on consumers’
evaluation of different food options based on search attributes (before
purchase) and the second after tasting it (simulating a post purchasing
situation). In between a hedonic sensory test is performed.

 

Simultaneously, as a complementary exercise, a trained panel sensory
test has been employed to identify the main organoleptic characteristics
that consumers associate with the hedonic taste satisfaction.

>

 

Finally, factors affecting consumers’ WTP differences in the two auctions
are analyzed.
