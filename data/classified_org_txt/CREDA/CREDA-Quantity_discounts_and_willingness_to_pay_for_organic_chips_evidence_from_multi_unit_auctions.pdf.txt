ABSTRUCT: 

 

In this paper we used multi-unit Vickrey and uniform-price auctions to measure 

consumers’ willingness to pay for organic potato chips.   

 

Faical – maybe we should just focus this paper purely on the WTP estimates and 

the issue of the whether quantity discount strategies would be a warranted marketing 

strategy.  So review the organic WTP studies and quantity discount literature – my 

guess is that no one has evaluated the issue of quantity discounts in organic food 

marketing.  This will be the contribution of our study.  No need to mention/focus on

which auction mechanism is better.  You can even just use the Vickrey multi-unit 

auction results and exclude the uniform price auction mechanism in this paper.   If you 

can then estimate a market demand curve , then you can also perhaps add some 

welfare analysis section – which would be a good addition to this paper…. 

 

Also we found that consumer’s willingness to pay is decreasing in the number of 

units and that the price of conventional food and positive attitudes toward organic food 

significantly affect consumers’ valuation for organic chips. 

 

 

WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTS: EVIDENCE FROM MULTI-

UNIT AND UNIFORM-PRICE AUCTIONS 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

The estimation of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for various food products 

has generated an extensive literature. In general, three alternative methods have been 

used: hedonic prices, contingent valuation, and conjoint analysis or choice 

experiments. The first method values the attributes of a good in terms of consumers’ 

revealed preferences, while the last two methods are generally based on stated 

preferences and involve asking subjects to hypothetically evaluate products or rate and 

choosing between competing alternatives. When using these methods researchers 

suppose that subjects report truthfully their WTP since they believe that their responses 

have not practical repercussions. However, this assumption has not received support in 

both theoretical and empirical literature. In fact, subjects have not any incentive to 

spend a cognitive effort to evaluate the product as they use to do in real market 

situations. Also, the assumption of truthfully behaving is neglected when the subject 



 3

believes that his/her value will be used to formulate business strategies or public 

policies and consequently s/he behaves strategically in an attempt to influence the 

price or the quality of the product. In both situations subject’s values are biased and the 

implementation of alternative experimental methods, such as experimental auctions, 

that allows researcher to impose costs on subjects who deviate from their true 

valuations, is necessary.   

 

Faical – instead of the paragraph above, start with a discussion of the market for 

organic foods, the increasing market for organics and potato chips market, and our 

objective of finding out consumers’ valuation of organic potato chips.  Then perhaps 

discuss why we are using multi-unit auctions – because we want to examine the issue 

of quantity discounts as a marketing strategy. 

 

 

 During the last decade, the use of experimental auctions has gained recognition 

among agricultural economists as a tool for valuation of private and public goods. The 

auctions are defined as a market institution for determining prices and assigning goods. 

Auctions have a set of rules that determine, according to the bids presented by the 

participating bidders, the winner of the auctioned good and the price to be paid 

(McAfee and McMillan, 1987). Experimental auctions try to simulate a real market 

situation in which the consumer makes the decision to buy, thus offering to participants 

real products and allowing for exchange of real money. In this way, the auction 

participant can incur real costs if he or she deviates from their equilibrium strategy. The 

experimental auctions: 1) permit the control of possible deviations from true values and 

strategic behavior of participants; 2) allow us to obtain the WTP of each individual, 

which then enables us to make parametric assumptions regarding the form of the 



 4

demand curves of the market; 3) allow us to model directly the determinants of the 

WTP, as the dependent variable is continuous or truncated; and 4) enable the 

participant to incorporate the ‘feedback’ from the experimental auction into his or her 

bids, just like in the real market (Lee and Hatcher, 2001; Lusk and Hudson, 2004). 

Several studies have used experimental auctions to determine consumers’ WTP 

for new food products. A major part of these works was focused on the valuation of 

food safety attributes (Fox et al., 2002; Dickinson and Bailey, 2002; Shaw et al., 2006) 

and the acceptability of new food products (Kassardjian et al., 2005; Rousu et al., 

2005). Many other works were carried out to contrast methodological aspects of 

auctions such as the comparison between the WTP and the WTA (Knetch et al., 2001; 

Shogren et al., 2001), learning effect (List and Shogren, 1999), the endowment effect 

(Lusk et al., 2004; Corrigan and Rousu, 2006), the optimum mechanism of auctions 

(Rusttrom, 1998; List and Luking-Reiley, 2000), and the risk preferences (McCeland et 

al., 1993) etc. 

In these studies, participants were asked to report their WTP for a single unit of 

the auctioned product2. However, the use of single-unit auctions to measure 

consumers’ WTP for each unit purchased is appropriate only if we assume that the 

WTP for all units purchased is the same. Nonetheless, this assumption contradicts 

economic theory as it predicts a reduction in the WTP of a rational consumer for each 

additional purchased unit beyond the first one.  In practice, a few food producers and 

retailers take into account this reduction of the WTP and adopt some marketing 

strategies, such as quantity discount (i.e., an incentive offered by a seller to a buyer for 

purchasing or ordering greater than usual or normal quantity of food products), to fit 

consumer preferences. To test this assumption, we use a relatively new method that 

preserves the advantages of experimental auctions and eliminates the bias of using 

single-unit auctions in a multi-unit setting. This method, called multi-unit auctions, is 

                                                 
2 Also the participant can be asked to report his/her WTP for different products but at the end of the 

auction only one product is randomly drawn to be sold to the winner.

defined as an auction where multiple identical units are auctioned and participants are 

asked to report their WTP for each unit.  

Among multi-unit auction formats, the most common mechanisms used in the 

empirical literature are the uniform-price and the multi-unit Vickrey auctions. The 

Vickrey auction is a generalization of the single-unit second price auction. In this 

mechanism, the winner will pay an amount corresponding to the sum of the bids 

(excluding his or her own bids) that are displaced by his or her successful bids. Since 

the clearing price is not based on the winner's bid but on the bids of the other 

participants, bidding truthfully is a dominant strategy in the Vickrey auction 

(Engelbrecht-Wiggans et al., 2006). Inspite of its demand-revealing property, the 

Vickrey auction, however, is not popularly used in real auctions due to the 

complexity of its pricing rule. In contrast, the uniform-price auction mechanism has 

been used frequently in Treasury bill and Federal Communications Commission 

(FCC) auctions due to its straightforward implementation and, therefore, 

understandable pricing rule.  All winners pay the same price which is equal to the 

highest rejected bid (Krishna, 2002). Ausubel and Cramton (2002) also mentioned 

other attractive properties of the uniform-price auction such as its fair outcome given 

that all winners pay the same price.  It also greatly widens the market since its pricing 

rule favors small bidders increasing their probability to become winners. 

Nevertheless, recent theoretical work (Englebrecht-Wiggans and Kahn (1998) and 

Ausubel and Cramton (2002)) has demonstrated that uniform price auction entails a 

potential problem commonly called "demand reduction”. In fact, since one of the 

participant’s bids can determine the clearing price (i.e., he or she has to pay for infra-

marginal units), the bidder has an incentive to bid less than their values for all units 

except for the first one, which reduces the seller's revenue and induces economic 

inefficiencies (Kagel and Levin, 2001). Therefore, in addition to analyzing the factors 

affecting the consumers’ WTP for multiple units of an organic product, another 



 6

contribution of our paper is to compare in an empirical setting consumers’ bidding 

behavior in the multi-unit Vickrey and the uniform-price auctions.   

The paper has been structured into four sections. In the next section we describe 

our experimental design. In the third section, results from both the survey and the 

experimental auction are presented. In section 4, we draw some concluding remarks 

 

2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   

 
We designed an experiment to analyze the main determinants of consumers’ 

WTP for organic products using multi-unit auctions and to evaluate the theoretical 

assumption of demand reduction, which is the reduction of the participant’s WTP when 

s/he decides to purchase multiple units of the same product. The auctioned products 

were 40g packages of organic potatoes chips. The experiment took place in June 

2008. 160 undergraduate students were recruited and were randomly assigned, 

equally, to four treatments. The use of a student sample was motivated by two 

reasons: 1) students are one of the most important potential consumer segments of 

potato chips packaged in small packets (40g) as they are basically sold in self-service 

machines that are generally located in universities (e.g., in our study 100% of 

participants declared to be at least occasional consumer of potato chips); and 2) 

studies by Dyer et al. (1989); Potters and van Winden (1996); Garratt et al. (2004); 

Lusk et al. (2005); and Depositario et al. (2009) showed no significant difference in 

subjects’ behaviour between studies employing student samples and those using more 

representative samples. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic and economic 

characteristics of the 160 participants in the experiment. About 46.4% of the subjects 

are regular consumers of chips and 13.1% are occasional consumers of organic chips. 

51.9% of the sample are at least occasional purchasers of organic products.  

Interestingly, only 5% of the participants knew perfectly the meaning of organic foods.

TABLE1. SAMPLE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS 

 

 

As mentioned earlier, we utilized and compared two auction mechanisms: multi-

unit Vickrey auction and uniform-price auction. In both mechanisms, we carried out ten 

sessions of two bidders and two units (2_2), ten sessions of two bidders and four units 

(2_4), two sessions of ten bidders and two units (10_2) and two sessions of ten bidders 

and four units (10_4)3. No subject participated in more than one session. Since we 

conducted the experiment through five rounds and needed to determine the winner(s) 

and the price to be paid after each round, we executed the experiment in a computer 

lab using the z-tree software (Fischbacher, 2007). Programming using the z-tree 

software allowed us to collect participants’ bids and compute all needed information 

in a relatively short time. Table 1 shows the number of auctions ran during the 

                                                 
3 By varying in the number of bidders and the number of units among treatments we aim to test the 

sensitivity of the participant’ bidding behavior to contrast the effect of varying the number of bidders and 
units in participants’ bidding behavior in both the multi-unit Vickrey and the uniform-price auctions.

 Before auctioning the product, participants filled in a questionnaire regarding 

various aspects related to organic products with the purpose of characterizing the 

sample and analyzing its main attitudes and purchase habits. This information was 

used to analyze the major factors that determine their willingness-to-pay for the 

multiple units of organic chips. The questionnaire was structured in four parts. The first 

part was intended to capture the purchasing and consumption habits related to potato 

chips. The second part included various questions intended to capture the participants’ 

degree of knowledge of organic food (measured through 8 statements about the 

characteristics of the organic food). The third part attempted to obtain information 

regarding the attitudes that participants had towards organic products (e.g., if they 

considered organic foods healthy, of higher quality or just a fraud). The fourth part 

included questions about subjects’ socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyles.  

We conducted the experiment using a four-step procedure. In step 1, participants 

were invited to a specific computer lab at a specific day and hour. Each subject sat in a 

table separated from the rest to minimize any possible interactions and so that each 

participant would report his or her bid in an anonymous manner. After taking a seat, 

each participant received an envelope which contained 10 Euros as compensation for 

their participation, his or her identification number (to be held in secret during the 

process) and a questionnaire designed to collect information on participants’ socio-

demographic characteristics.  



 9

In step 2, once the questionnaire was completed, the actual experiment began. 

One of the main determinants of success in experimental auctions is a good 

understanding by the participants of the operating procedures used in the auction 

mechanism. To achieve this goal, we gave each participant a printed material that 

included an explanation of how the specific auction works and some examples to 

illustrate the auction. The instructions were identical across all treatments except for 

auction type and number of the bidders and units. After reading and discussing the 

instructions, participants were given the opportunity to ask questions to dissipate any 

doubts about the process. Finally, to permit a better understanding of the auction 

mechanism and a good familiarity with the software, we carried out a training session 

using an auction of two or four (depending on the treatment) identical packets of the 

product we used in the auctions (i.e., organic potato chips), informing participants that 

no actual economic exchange will take place at the end of the training session.  

In step 3, and once the participants became familiar with the procedure, the 

subjects were requested to come close to a table where a few packets of organic 

potato chips were placed along. Each participant was allowed to visually and manually 

inspect the auctioned product. Once all participants had finished inspecting the 

product, the auction began.  Each participant had to submit, via the computer, how 

much he or she was willing-to-pay for each auctioned unit. Once all participants 

finished to report their bid, the software displayed whether the participant was the 

winner or not and the price that he/she had to pay for each unit won. The same 

process was repeated for four additional rounds.  

In step 4, the auctioneer closed the auction (after the fifth round) and one binding 

round was chosen randomly to determine the winner(s). The winner(s) of the binding 

round was (were) appointed as the winner(s) of the auction. Once the results were 

announced, the experiment ended by handing the product to the winner(s) who had to 

pay the corresponding market-clearing price.

3. RESULTS 

 As mentioned in the introduction, we wish to evaluate the theoretical 

assumption of a reduction in consumers’ WTP in a multiple-unit purchase setting and, 

therefore, the necessity of adopting the strategy of price discrimination (a lower price 

for each additional purchased unit) as a marketing tool to better fit consumers’ 

preferences. As predicted by the theory, Figure 1 shows that the mean of participants’ 

WTP for organic potato chips is decreasing as the number of units being auctioned 

increases in both mechanisms. In fact, the mean WTP taking into account both 

mechanisms is 0.97€ for the first unit, 0.70€, for the second unit, 0.48€, for the third 

unit and 0.34€, for the fourth unit. Moreover, differences between average bids of two 

concrete units (1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3 and 3 vs. 4) are statistically significant at the 5% level. 

These results show the importance of encouraging the adoption and the generalization 

of the strategy of quantity discount by food retailers to better fit consumer’s 

preferences.

 In this study, we are also interested in analyzing the factors affecting 

consumers’ WTP for multiple units of organic potato chips using multi-unit auctions.  



 11

We estimated five random effects Tobit models to take into account the panel nature of 

our data.  The dependent variables are: (1) the average WTP for all auctioned units; (2) 

the WTP for the first auctioned unit [BID1]; (3) the WTP for the second auctioned unit 

[BID2]; (4) the WTP for the third auctioned unit [BID3]; and (5) the WTP for the fourth 

auctioned unit [BID4].  Regarding the explanatory variables, Annex1 shows the list of 

variables used in this study as well as a short description on how they were measured. 

In order to keep the estimated model as simple and manageable as possible, 

information on participants’ attitudes toward organic food (that were measured through 

a 9-item Likert scale) has been reduced through a factor analysis (see Annex 2) 

resulting in 4 factors: 1) positive attitude toward organic foods (GOOD); 2) negative 

attitudes toward organic foods (WORSE); 3) no differences between conventional and 

organic foods (NODIFFER); and 4) unavailability of organic foods in shops and 

supermarkets (UNAVAIL).

*** (**) (*) Statistically significant at 1% (5%) (10%) level 

  

Results from the five random effects Tobit models are shown in Table 3. In 

general, we note that the results from the first, the second and the third model are 

similar.  However, the statistical significance of the variables decreased in models 4 

and 5 due the small number of positive value in the bid for the third and fourth units 

(i.e., 21% of the third-unit bids and 36% of the fourth-unit bids are zero bids). As 

predicted by Englebrecht-Wiggans and Kahn (1998), we found that consumers’ 

willingness to pay for organic potato chips decreases significantly when we move from 

the multi-unit Vickrey auction to the uniform-price auction. This finding implies that the 

frequent use of the uniform-price auction in Treasury bill and FCC auctions may 

have to be reconsidered due to the dramatic damage that can engender the 

problem of demand reduction on the sellers outcomes. On the other hand, the 

use of the multi-unit Vickrey auction to measure consumers’ WTP seems to be 

effective as it has shown insensitivity to the demand reduction issue.  

 In accordance with other studies, such as Drichoutis et al (2008), we have 

found that the reference price exercises a significant effect on consumer’s WTP. In 

fact, our results showed that the higher is the price of conventional potato chips (i.e., 

average price of 40g of conventional potato chips in supermarkets), the higher is the 

participant’s WTP for organic chips.  This result is of great interest for food retailers 

who sell their own brand of organic food. In fact, some big retailers sell their brand of 

conventional food at a lower price in comparison with other brands of the same product 

but sell their brand of organic food at a price equal to the price of the other brands sold 



 13

in the market. Therefore, since the consumer is sensitive to the reference price, s/he 

expects that the price of retailers’ brand of organic product is lower than private brands 

of the same product. But if retailers offer similar prices, consumers might think that the 

retailers’ organic product is too expensive and may turn his/her interest to the branded 

products generally considered to of higher quality.  

 We also found that the more positive is the consumer’s attitude toward organic 

food, the greater is his/her WTP for organic chips. This finding showed the necessity of 

multiplying and expanding promotion companies to sensitize a larger number of 

consumers of organic foods’ benefits.  

 

 

 

4. CONCLUSION 

 In this study, we used multi-unit auctions to measure consumers’ willingness to 

pay for organic potato chips. In contrast to single-unit auctions, the multi-unit auctions 

allowed as to construct the real demand curve of the auctioned product. We used the 

multi-unit Vickrey auction and the uniform-price auction mechanisms in our 

experiments. The former is a compatible incentive mechanism but difficult to implement 

due to its rule complexity. The second mechanism is easy to use but incentives 

participant to reduce strategically her/his demand for units beyond the first one. To 

avoid the problem of demand reduction and to take advantage of multi-unit auction’s 

benefits, we recommend the use of the multi-unit Vickrey auction. Nonetheless, Porter 

and Vargov (2006) showed in an induced value setting that the Vickrey auction is 

sensitive to participant’s overbidding behavior and, therefore, we need carrying out 

more researches not only to contrast the overbidding in multi-unit Vickrey auction 

but also to study the effect of other key aspects in experimental auction such the 

endowment effect and the bid affiliation on subject bidding behavior. Also our 

results showed that the price of conventional product and consumer’s positive 



 14

attitude toward organic food are key factors of willingness to pay for organic chips 

and, therefore, has to be seriously taken into account when laboring marketing 

strategies for trading organic food.
