1. Introduction

Sales promotions have become a fundamental strategy typically
employed as part of a marketing mix. Consequently, they have
become a significant part of promotional budgets over the years.
For example, sales promotions have been estimated to represent
74% of the marketing budgets of US packaged goods
manufacturers (Cox Direct, 1998).

Although there is a large number of studies that have evaluated the
effect of brand promotions, store promotion and coupons, very few
studies have examined the effect of multi-unit price promotions
which involve selling more than one product for one price (e.g., “buy
5 units for $5, you save $2” etc.) on sales.

3. Results

5 units for $5, you save $2” etc.) on sales.

Multi-unit price promotions can be beneficial to marketers for two
major reasons: 1) for retailers and manufacturers, it might be
preferable to guarantee sales today than probabilistic future sales;
2) due to increasing time constraints, many consumers are
becoming increasingly concerned about optimizing shopping
efficiency by purchasing multiple units of products to save several
trips to the store.

In contrast to previous studies, we examine the sensitiveness of
sales to the distribution across units of the amount of price discount
in multi-unit price promotions. We compared the effect of three
types of price-discount distribution on consumers’ willingness to pay
(WTP), sales value and retailers’ revenues: (1) the quantity of price
discount is distributed equally among units; (2) the quantity of price
discount is concentrated on the last purchased unit (e.g. “buy 2
units and pay only for 1”); and (3) the amount of price discount is
increasing in the number of units (i.e. the price discount on the
second purchased unit is higher than price discount on the first unit
and so on).

2. Experimental design

Sample: 120 subjects were randomly drawn from a list of people
who are responsible for food shopping in their household. Each
participant received 15€ as participation fees. Participants were
then randomly assigned to four treatments. Sessions were

then randomly assigned to four treatments. Sessions were
conducted in groups of 10 subjects so each treatment consisted of
three sessions.

Treatments: In the first three treatments participants were offered
different price-discount distributions (see figures bellow). For
robustness check, we provided the subjects of the fourth treatment
the three types of price promotion at the same time. 4. Conclusion

� The distribution of price discount in price promotions does
matter.

� Increasing the amount of price discount with the number of
units increases consumers’ WTP, sales value and retailers’
revenues.

� The uniform price discount promotion has the potential to
motivate consumers to buy more units of the same product but
its effect on WTP, sales value, and retailers’ revenues is
generally lower than the increasing price discount strategy.

� The multi-unit price promotion (e.g. buy six and pay five for six-
pack products) that applies all the amount of price discount on
the last unit provided only a weak effect on WTP sales value.

� A good topic for future research is the assessment of the effect
of different amounts of an increasing price discount across
units on consumers’ WTP.

Treatment 1 Treatment 2 Treatment 3

Value-elicitation method: In our study, we conducted a non-
hypothetical multi-unit Vickrey auction. we auctioned six units of a
new product in two rounds. In the first round participants report their
WTP for each auctioned unit. We then provided participants the
price-promotion information and then asked them to again reveal
their WTP for each of the six units. From the participants’ WTP
before and after price discount promotion, we determine the
quantity that can be sold, the value of sales before and after
promotion, and retailers’ revenues.
