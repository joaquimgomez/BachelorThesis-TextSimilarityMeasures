Abstract. Immigration has become a new phenomenon in Spanish society during the last years. In 2007, immigrants 
represented around 10% of total population, with 35% coming from Latin-American countries. When immigrants 
arrive, they bring their own values and cultural symbols, which, essentially, are different from those of the indigenous 
population. As time goes through, two alternative processes are observed: 1) a gradual switch towards the Host 
Society values; or 2) a maintenance of their ethnical identity. Focussing in the Latin-American immigrants in 
Barcelona, the objective of this paper is twofold: 1) to measure their degree of ethnical identity; and 2) to analyse the 
relationship between food habits and their ethnical identity. Food habits refer here to the consumption of traditional 
meals from their country of origin. Face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of Latin American 
immigrants in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona are undertaken. First, socioeconomics characteristics of the 
sample are described. Second, the MEIM scale is used to measure their ethnical identity, which combines aspects 
from the social identity and personal development theories. Finally, a Multinomial Logit Model is estimated to 
identify the relationship between food habits and ethnical identity. Results indicate that the higher the level of ethnic 
identity and feeling of belonging, the greater the persistence of dietary habits from the country of origin. 

Keywords: Ethnic identity, Food habits, Latin American immigrants, Spain. 

1. Introduction 
The world’s population is growing at a staggering rate; in 2006, there were 6,600 million people 

on the planet [18], which was twice as many as there had been 50 years earlier. This dramatic increase in 
population, combined with an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth among different parts of the 
planet, has led an increase in migratory movements from lesser to more developed countries. While this 
trend is not entirely new, in recent years, it has increased as the global population has grown. According 
to the United Nations [18], over 190 million people (3% of the world’s population) are estimated to be 
living outside their country of origin.  

Spain has not remained unaffected by these migratory processes, and has gone from being a 
major source of emigration for much of the 20th century to an attractive destination for immigration, 
particularly in the past 20 years. From 1910 to 1960 there was a mass migration from Spain to the 
Americas, and this was followed by emigration to the richer parts of Europe (France, Germany, 
Switzerland, and Great Britain) between 1960 and 1980. Nonetheless, with the return to democracy in 
1975, many Spanish exiles began to return to their homeland. This influx was particularly great during the 
1980s for two main reasons: the recovery of the economy, which entered a period of stability in the 
second half of the 1980s, and Spain’s joining of the European Union (EU) on January 1, 1986. Between 
1996 and 2007, the country’s immigrant population increased from 1.6% to 10% of the total population. 
Of the 4,519,554 immigrants registered in Spain in 2007, the largest group (33%) were from South 
America.  

When immigrants arrive in a new place, they have different values and cultural symbols to those 
of the host society. Examples of these values and symbols include lifestyle habits, dietary habits, manner 
of dress and manners [6] or religion, language, leisure activities, art, literature, music and customs [2], [5], 
[13]. With time, however, two sharply contrasting trends emerge: acculturation and preservation of 
traditional culture. Acculturation is where an ethnic group gradually changes its cultural symbols, 
adapting them to the host society and sometimes even replacing them completely. Preservation of culture 
occurs in ethnic groups that decide to preserve the majority of their cultural symbols (i.e., their ethnic 
identity), despite contact with the host society. 
In both cases, the first symbols to be lost are related to language, manner of dress, and manners. Dietary 
habits, in contrast, as several studies have indicated, seem to be preserved for longest, with resistance 



3 

increasing with age [4], [3], [9], [12]. The cultural significance of dietary choices becomes even more important 
if we consider that food is one of the most powerful symbols of who we are [8].  

This study has two main aims: 1) to measure the level of ethnic identity of the immigrant 
population in Spain by focusing on ethnic groups in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, which is one of 
the regions with the largest numbers of immigrants; and 2) to measure the extent to which levels of ethnic 
identity can explain why immigrants choose to preserve dietary habits. We measured the preservation of 
these habits by analyzing the consumption of typical dishes from the country of origin. To ensure the 
greatest level of homogeneity possible, we included only Latin American immigrants in our study 
population.  

Although the literature contains numerous studies of the correlation between ethnic identity and 
dietary habits [17], [1], [20], [15], [4], [22], [14] the present study has two innovative features. First, studies 
performed to date have only used partial indicators to measure ethnic identity, even though this is a 
multidimensional variable that embraces aspects such as feelings of belonging, attitudes, customs, 
traditions, and social interaction. To assess the multidimensional nature of ethnic identity, we used a 
measure developed by Roberts [19] which considers all of the above aspects. Second, and from an 
empirical perspective, this is the first study to characterize the socioeconomic status of Latin American 
immigrants in Spain on the basis of levels of ethnic identity[1].  

The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 analyzes migration flows in Spain to give 
an idea of the relevance of this study. Section 3 describes the data sources used and section 4, the 
characteristics of the study population. Section 5 analyzes levels of ethnic identity, and section 6 
describes the model used and discusses our main findings. The final section presents some concluding 
remarks. 

 
2. Spain, from a country of emigration to one of immigration 

 
As already mentioned in the introduction, Spain has gone from being a country of emigration to 

one of immigration. The emigration took place in 2 waves. In the first wave (1910-1960), the Spanish 
emigrated great distances, heading mostly to the Americas, which received 71.88% of all Spain’s 
emigrants during this period. In the 1920s and 1930s, the favoured destination was Argentina, but from 
1950 onwards other countries such as Venezuela, Uruguay, and Brazil became popular choices. This first 
exodus can be explained by the difficult economic, social, and political conditions facing Spain in the 
aftermath of the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and the Second World War (1939-1945). Faced with a 
Europe devastated by war, emigrants chose to go to the Americas. In the second wave of emigration 
(1960-1980), the destination changed, with Europe, in the midst of economic recovery, taking over as the 
destination of choice. Between 1970 and 1980, 85.4% of Spanish emigrants sought a new life in Europe 
(Figure 1), and along with emigrants from other parts of Mediterranean Europe, were a welcome addition 
to the increasing labour force needed to meet growing agricultural and industrial production needs.  

 
(Take in Figure 1) 

 
As mentioned above, Spain’s migration flows began to change direction in the second half of the 

1970s, with the restoration of democracy and the return of the first Spanish exiles from other parts of 
Europe. Although the influx decreased in magnitude over the years, it continued into the mid 1980s 
(Figure 2). A new trend emerged in 1987, following Spain’s joining of the EU, as large numbers of 
emigrants began to return from the Americas. In 26 years, between 1975 and 2001, 689,418 Spanish 
emigrants returned to their homeland.  

(Take in Figure 2) 
 

This enormous influx coincided with the arrival of Spain’s first immigrants and the beginning of 
a new era, which was to have an enormous impact on the country over the following 2 decades. Although 
the first wave of immigrants arrived in 1996, immigration did not become a recognizable upward trend 
until 2 years later (Figure 3). Interestingly, approximately 50% of new arrivals between 1998 and 2000 
were from other parts of Europe. The second largest group (24%) were from Africa (mainly Morocco). 
During these early years, Latin Americans accounted for barely 15% of the total immigrant population 
but this was to change in 2002, when they became the most numerous ethnic group in Spain (Figure 3).

The rapid growth in the Latin American immigrant population was driven by at least 2 factors: 
1) the excellent opportunities offered by the country’s booming economy (with growth rates above the 
EU average), and 2) the lack of a language barrier, which made economic and social integration easier. 

 
(Take in Figure 3) 

 
Table 1 shows the evolution of immigration in Spain. As can be seen, immigrants accounted for 

just 1.6% of the total population in 1998 but this had risen to 10% by 2007 [11]. This percentage varied 
from region to region and was highest in Spain’s strongest autonomous communities. In Catalonia, for 
example, immigrants accounted for 13.5% of the Catalan population in 2007. The corresponding 
percentage for Barcelona was around 13%.  

According to the latest data released by the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and 
Marine Affairs, 54% of Latin American immigrants in Spain still eat dishes from their countries of origin, 
indicating that this is a habit that is not easily lost. In the following sections, we will analyze the situation 
in the metropolitan area of Barcelona and attempt to identify factors that determine this behaviour.

3. Data Sources 
 

To collect the information required for our study, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 262 
immigrants considered to be representative of the Latin American immigrant community in the 
metropolitan area of Barcelona in terms of nationality and age. Drawing from the census, we chose 
immigrants from 7 countries (Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Chile), 
which, combined, accounted for over 75% of the Latin American countries with immigrants in the area. 
Table 2 shows the distribution of the sample. The field work was conducted between January and March 
2007. 

The questionnaire consisted of three main parts. The first part contained questions about the 
purchase of typical food from the country of origin (availability, place of purchase, frequency, reasons for 
buying or not buying, etc.). The second part was designed to collect information required to measure the 
level of ethnic identity, one of the main aims of the study. To do this, we used the multiple group ethnic 
identity measure (MEIM) scale proposed by Roberts [19]. This scale combines two theoretical approaches. 
The first is the social identity theory [21], which focuses on the feeling of belonging to a group and the 
accompanying attitudes and feelings. According to this theory, belonging to a group forms part of a 



5 

person’s individual identity and self-conception. In other words, people who have a good knowledge of 
the group to which they belong value this group and gain self-esteem from the associated feeling of 
belonging. The second theory is Erikson’s [7] personal development theory, according to which the 
formation of individual identity arises from a process of exploration and commitment to the identity 
group, which typically occurs during adolescence. The more intense the process, the greater the level of 
commitment to the group. When the process is less intense, the result is a simple feeling of affirmation 
and belonging. The third part of the questionnaire was designed to gather information on the 
socioeconomic background of those interviewed. Variables included age, sex, educational level, marital 
status, level of income, type of residence in Barcelona, reason for emigration, and length of time in Spain.

4. Characterization of sample by nationality 
 

Table 3 shows the main characteristics of the sample by group and by nationality. As can be 
seen, 58.8% of respondents were married or living with a partner while the remaining 41.2% were single, 
separated, divorced, or widowed. The high percentage of those married or living with a partner was to be 
expected given that one of the main reasons people migrate is to look for better economic opportunities 
for the family, and the majority emigrate with their families.  

Almost half of the sample (48.5%) had secondary-level education. Education up to secondary 
level was particularly common among immigrants from the Dominican Republic (72.7%) and Ecuador 
(75.4%). The majority of the sample (51.9%) worked as builders or day labourers, occupations that were 
associated with secondary-level education. As the level of education increased, so did access to jobs 
requiring greater qualifications. This was evident in the case of the Peruvians, who had one of the highest 
levels of education in the group (36.3% had an undergraduate degree) and the highest percentage of jobs 
involving greater responsibility (34.1%). The situation was similar for those from Chile as 64.5% of these 
had a Masters or doctorate degree. The majority of immigrants from Chile, however, indicated that they 
were not working, suggesting that most of them had come to Spain to study and improve their 
qualifications. Of interest among the Colombians and Argentineans was the fact that they were the 
nationalities in which the greatest percentage of people with a higher level of studies were self-employed 
(business owners or professionals, among others).

Of those interviewed, 70.3% had a monthly household income of less than €2100 (this was less 

than €1500 in 42.8% of cases). These income levels are consistent with the labour situation of the 
immigrants as a whole, most of whom were employed in physical labour, as mentioned previously. Type 
of residence was also associated with income level, with 63.4% of those interviewed living in rented 
accommodation. Of particular interest was the case of the Bolivians, one of the groups with the lowest 
level of income, as 35.4% of these were living in a rented room. Income levels also affected car 
ownership. Only 24% of those interviewed had a car (some had 2 cars) and 75.2% stated that they could 
not afford one. 

Almost two thirds (64.1%) of the respondents stated that they had left their country for economic 
reasons. The majority of countries in Latin America are undergoing economic difficulties, although the 
complexity of the situation varies from one country to the next. Countries which experienced serious 
economic and political problems several years ago account for the most numerous groups of immigrants 
in Spain. The percentages for those who left their countries for economic reasons were 76.8% for the 
Ecuadorians, 86.5% for the Bolivians, 70.5% for the Peruvians, and 72.7% for the Dominicans.  

A majority (55%) of those interviewed had been living in Spain for between five and nine years. 
This percentage was considerably higher in the case of the Ecuadorians (85.5%), who have benefited 
from special agreements between the Spanish and Ecuadorian governments. Dominicans were the group 
that had been in Spain for the longest (45.5% had been there for over 10 years).

5. Measurement of ethnic identity 
 

As already mentioned in section 3, we measured ethnic identity using the MEIM scale [21], which 
combines aspects from the social identity and personal development theories. To measure the level of 
ethnic identity (social identity theory), the scale considers five items, labelled affirmation and belonging, 
dealing with attachment, pride, and positive feelings towards one’s ethnicity. To measure aspects related 
to the exploration of one’s identity and commitment to a group (personal development theory), it 
considers four items related to exploration (activities to learn about the identity group) and three related to 
commitment (a clear understanding of one’s ethnicity). These seven items were labelled ethnic identity 
achievement. Finally, the MEIM scale included two questions designed to measure aspects such as 
customs, traditions, and social interaction. These two items were labelled ethnic behaviour. The MEIM 
thus consisted of 14 items, each of which was rated by the respondents on a scale of 0 to 10. 

Using the scores obtained, we conducted factor analysis to determine if the structure of the 
factors on the scale provided a good fit to the 2 theories being explored and to identify which items were 
correlated with which factors. Our analysis revealed three factors, one of which, however, consisted of 
just two items. Because this violates the criteria proposed by Hatcher [10], we eliminated these two items, 
leaving the scale with 12 items. Subsequent factor analysis revealed two factors, which, combined, 
accounted for 45.7% of the total variance. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 4, together with 
the mean scores and standard deviations for each item (the two columns on the right).

As can be seen, the analysis confirmed the validity of the MEIM scale for the purpose of the 

study as the two factors were correlated to the items generated by the two theories on which they were 
based. Factor 1 consisted of the five original questions from the affirmation and belonging subscale 
(social identity theory) and two questions from the commitment subscale (personal development theory). 
This factor accounted for 32.64% of the total variance and was labelled affirmation, belonging, and 
commitment. Factor 2 consisted of three items from the exploration subscale and two from the ethnic 
behaviour subscale, and was labelled exploration and active participation in group identity. This factor 
accounted for 13.06% of the total variance. Both factors include exactly the same items than in Roberts 
[19]; thus, we have used the same labels for them. 

 
 
6. Consumption habits and ethnic identity 

 
This last section deals with the main aim of this study: the analysis of the extent to which ethnic 

identity is capable of explaining why Latin American immigrants living in the metropolitan area of 
Barcelona change or do not change their dietary habits. To this end, we measured the frequency with 
which the respondents ate traditional dishes from their country (typical dishes) using a nominal scale 
containing 4 categories: does not eat, eats daily, eats once or twice a week, and eats once or twice a 
month.  
 

6.1. Specification of model 
 

Considering the nature of the dependent variable, we analyze the main factors affecting the 
consumption of typical dishes by specifying and estimating a multinomial logit model. The likelihood of 
an individual choosing one of the four categories that comprised the dependent variable is given by:

where j (J=1,2,3,4) represents each of the four choices of the dependent variable and “x” is a vector of 
explanatory variables affecting each choice. 

As can be seen, (1) features an identification problem that needs to be resolved. If we define 
*
j j q= +β β , for any vector q we get exactly the same probabilities as all the terms affected by q are 

cancelled. This means that not all the parameters would have been identified. To resolve this problem, we 
chose one of the choices as the reference category and all its parameters are normalized to zero. The 
category chosen was “does not eat typical dishes”. As in other discrete choice models, the parameters are 
interpreted by calculating the effects on the respective likelihood of unit changes or by interpreting signs 
on the parameters.  

Table 5 shows which explanatory variables might predict the consumption of typical dishes on 
the basis of the information collected during the interviews. As can be seen, in addition to factors 
influencing ethnic identity, we also gathered information on aspects related to 1) socioeconomic 
characteristics, 2) habits related to the purchase and consumption of food, 3) reasons for immigration, 4) 
length of time in Spain, and 5) knowledge of Catalan (official language in Catalonia together with 
Spanish).

 6.2. Results 
 

Table 6 shows the results of the multinomial logit model. As can be seen, the goodness of fit is 
quite good, with a McFadden [16] value of 0.22 [2]. In considering the results presented for the different 
categories of the dependent variable, it should be borne in mind that these should be interpreted at all 
times with respect to the reference category (does not eat typical dishes). Five of the explanatory variables 
considered were significant. With respect to the aim of the study, the two variables that explained ethnic 
identity were both significant and positive, indicating that the higher the level of ethnic identity, the 
greater the tradition of continuing to eat typical dishes. In other words, dietary habits are preserved as an 
important expression of culture. It is noteworthy that exploration and active participation in group identity 
had a slightly higher impact on the consumption of typical dishes than affirmation, belonging, and 
commitment. Specifically, an increase in the affirmation, belonging, and commitment variable was 
associated with a 2.03-fold increase (exp(0.71) in the likelihood of eating typical dishes more frequently, 
compared to those who did not eat them (reference category). The corresponding unit increase for the 



10 

exploration and active participation in group identity variable was 1.98. This would seem to indicate that 
the likelihood of eating typical dishes on a frequent basis increases if ethnic identity has been acquired 
through a process of exploration and commitment, which, as Erikson [7] indicated, results in a greater 
level of identification with the group and its associated cultural features. Our results also show that the 
likelihood of eating typical dishes every day increases if all the members of the family are involved. It is 
reasonable to assume that these dishes are eaten at home and that the family would need to buy typical 
ingredients, a hypothesis that is supported by the positive sign on the buy frequently variable. Also of 
interest is the fact that we detected the highest level of consumption of typical dishes among respondents 
with the lowest levels of education. 

We also found that ethnic identity was not such a strong explanatory factor for eating typical 
dishes once or twice a week. Indeed, of the two variables considered, only affirmation, belonging, and 
commitment (associated with a simple feeling of belonging to a group) was significant and positive. An 
increase of one unit in this variable corresponded to a 1.75-fold increase in the likelihood of eating typical 
dishes once or twice a week relative to not eating any. The second variable, exploration and active 
participation in group identity, was not significant in this case. The other variables found to be significant 
are similar to those mentioned in the previous category, but in this case, consumption of typical dishes 
was associated with eating at home (negative sign for outside the home) and with family events and 
traditions.  

Finally, the results observed for those that ate typical dishes less frequently seems to confirm that 
there is an association between ethnic identity and the maintenance of traditions related to food. In this 
case, neither of the 2 variables that defined the level of ethnic identity was significant. In other words, the 
higher the level of acculturation, the weaker the feeling of belonging to the group and the lower the 
likelihood of eating typical dishes.  

Considering the negligible significance of the rest of the variables, we can conclude that this 
sporadic consumption of typical dishes occurs when the people in this category are invited to dinner by 
compatriots as they do not buy typical ingredients (even occasionally) and all the members of the family 
are involved equally.

7. Conclusions 
 

Immigration is a relatively recent phenomenon in Spain. Despite the political controversies it has 
sparked, it has given rise to a large number of studies aimed at gaining a better understanding of new 
immigrants in Spain. Because dietary habits are one of the last lifestyle habits to be lost when adapting to 
a new culture, we decided to analyze the extent to which immigrants in Spain continued to eat dishes 
from their country of origin. Given the large variety of immigrant nationalities in the study area, we 



11 

decided to focus on immigrants from Latin America. Unlike other immigrants, Latin Americans in theory 
should find it easier to integrate in the host society as they do not have to overcome the problem of 
language. 

The hypothesis we wanted to test was whether dietary habits were closely associated with the 
ethnic identity of a population. In other words, we wished to see whether these habits were more common 
in immigrants with a higher level of ethnic identity. We sought to obtain empirical evidence to support 
this hypothesis using a representative sample of Latin American immigrants from the metropolitan area of 
Barcelona.  

Our results confirmed this hypothesis in that we found that the higher the level of ethnic identity 
and feeling of belonging, the greater the persistence of dietary habits from the country of origin. We also 
found that the tradition of eating typical food was shared by all the members of a family, meaning that 
there was an active search for the necessary ingredients. Contrary to what might have been expected and 
contrasting with results from other studies [23], [22], we found no association between the persistence of 
dietary habits and either the length of time spent in Spain or the level of integration into the Catalan 
culture (measured through the use of the Catalan language). Also of interest was the fact that the 
consumption of typical dishes was greatest in families with a lower level of education. 

This study sought to shed light on the dietary habits of immigrants in Spain, which is something 
that has been briefly studied by the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs. 
While our findings should logically be interpreted within the context of the population and sample 
studied, they do raise new questions that require further analysis. One obvious extension of our work 
would be to analyze other immigrant groups such as Muslims, Asians, and Eastern Europeans. The 
second one would be to use alternative scales to measure levels of ethnic identity and acculturation. From 
our perspective, two issues would require further research in the future. First, to what extent there are 
behavioural differences when comparing at-home and away-from-home food consumption. Second, new 
research should be addressed to analyze the generation (cohort) effect to detect possible differences 
between the behaviour of immigrants and that of their children in order to anticipate future patterns of 
behaviour. 

 

Notes. 
 
1. To date, only the Spanish Ministry for the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs (MARM) has 
studied the food-buying and dietary habits of different immigrants in Spain. It has produced a descriptive 
report for the last 3 years. 
 
2. McFadden (1973) considers that a value of between 0.2 and 0.4 reflects a good fit; this would be 
equivalent to a determination coefficient of between 0.75 and 0.9 using a linear regression model.
