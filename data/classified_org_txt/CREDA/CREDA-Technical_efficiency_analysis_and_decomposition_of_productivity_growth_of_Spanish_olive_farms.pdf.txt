Abstract 
The concept of technical efficiency is critical to measuring the firm performance, determining the degree 
of innovative technology adoption and the overall production efficiency. Traditionally, technical 
efficiency has been measured as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output. Stochastic 
frontier models have been widely utilized to assess this issue. Our research evaluates technical 
efficiencies in the Spanish olive sector. Specifically, the main objective of this study is to estimate a 
stochastic frontier production model by using a farm-level panel of data. The non-negative technical 
efficiency effects are assumed to be a function of firm-specific variables. A sample of Spanish farms 
observed from 1999 to 2002 is obtained from the FADN dataset and used in the estimation of the model. 
Maximum-likelihood methods are applied in the estimation of the parameters of the model. A primal 
approach is used to decompose Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. Results indicate that farm 
location, age of manager, tenure regimes of land and whether the farm has adopted organic farming 
techniques affect efficiency levels. Technical efficiency change, allocative efficiencies and scale effects 
are found to be the main sources of TFP growth, while technical change seems to be of minor importance. 
Results also suggest that Spanish olive farms are less efficient relative to other EU farms. This suggests 
that improvements in the Spanish olive productive capacity after the accession to the EU were not fully 
implemented in the period of analysis. This may be due to a decline in olive farm incomes as a result of a 
decline in both public subsidies and in output prices after the mid 1990s.

Introduction 
 

The olive sector has a significant social, economic and environmental relevance within 

the European Union (EU). This relevance can be justified by different reasons. First, 

olive cultivation, which is widespread throughout the Mediterranean region, constitutes 

a key element of the EU agricultural model. According to Olistat, the area under olive 

groves accounts for approximately 5.4 million hectares, representing around 4% of the 

EU utilizable agricultural area. Spain, with more than 2.4 million hectares concentrates 

almost 45% of the EU olive groves extension. This sector involves around a third of all 

EU farmers, with about 2.5 million producers (Directorate-General for Agriculture, 

2002), of which 380,000 are located in Spain. Second, olive production is concentrated 

in less-developed areas. With only a few exceptions, a majority of producer areas are 

under Objective 1 of the EU Regional Policy. In these regions, olive cultivation 

provides an important source of employment. Olive picking creates seasonal 

employment in winter, thus complementing with seasonal jobs provided by other 

agricultural activities. Third, because the olive processing industry is composed by a 

large number of small and medium-sized industries that are often located near to 

producing areas, it further contributes to the economic development of these areas. 

Fourth, traditional olive groves are very valuable as a tool in addressing environmental 

problems such as desertification and loss of biodiversity. As a result, abandonment of 

traditional olive holdings may bring increased environmental deterioration. Fifth, olive 

cultivation has a number of distinctive features that create some disadvantages to the 

sector relative to other agricultural activities. These features include the structural 

inflexibility inherent to olive groves that restricts the capacity to adapt to market 

conditions; a high dependence of yields on both weather conditions and alternate 

bearing; a marked heterogeneity of holdings across space; or an intense fragmentation 



 2

of the sector both at the farm and industry level. Finally, the olive sector is a major 

cultural factor in the Mediterranean countries, with a role that goes beyond agricultural 

production to embrace tourist and gastronomic activities, as well as social and cultural 

events. The EU has long recognized such distinctive characteristics of olive farming and 

has provided this sector with specific regulations and support measures. An example is 

provided by the exclusion of the olive sector from the 1990s and the 2003 decoupled-

oriented CAP reforms in order to support the sector, prevent the abandonment of olive 

groves in marginal areas, and support sustainable development of the sector through 

promotion of healthy and quality products and prices. 

The EU occupies prominent positions in worldwide rankings of olive oil and 

table olives production and trade. According to the International Oleic Council data 

(IOOC), EU harvests showed an upturn in the second half of the 1990s reaching 2.5 

million tones in the 2001/02 marketing year, representing 82% of worldwide 

production. The EU is followed, at a distance, by Tunisia, Turkey, Syria and Morocco 

in terms of productive capacity. Spain accounted for almost 1.4 million tones in the 

same period, a 54% of EU production and a 47% of world’s output. The EU is also the 

top producer of table olives, with a share in world production of 52% in 2001/02. Here 

too, Spain represents the first producer since it generates 75% of the EU’s output and 

almost 40% of worldwide production. 

Olive oil tends to be consumed in production areas. As a result, external trade 

represents less than 20% of world production. IOOC data suggest that the EU accounts 

for more than half of worldwide olive oil exports, the main destinations being the 

United States of America, Japan, Canada and Australia. Spain and Italy are the largest 

EU exporters. During the 2001/02 marketing year, Spain exported 112,500 tones to non-

EU countries and 488,000 tones to the EU. Hence, of total Spanish olive oil exports, 



 3

more than 81% went to the EU. It is a fact that the olive oil sector in the EU has 

undergone substantial changes since the Spanish accession to the Community. 

Specifically, it has become the largest world producer and a key player in the worldwide 

olive oil trade. Additionally, total olive production has increased substantially in the EU 

over the last decade, mainly as a result of relevant increases in Spanish output.  

Olive grove area represents around 13% of the total agricultural area in Spain 

(Spanish Ministry for Agriculture, 2003). A 93% of this area is devoted to olive oil 

production, being the rest dedicated to the production of table olives. As noted above, 

Spanish olive production has experienced a substantial growth since the adhesion to the 

EU. The increases in output are the result of both an increase in new plantations (even 

after 1998 when new plantations were excluded from EU production aids) and an 

increase in yields per hectare. Yields increase is the outcome of a series of changes in 

production methods such as improvements in growing techniques, the replacement of 

old trees by new ones and, specially, the increase in irrigated olive groves (which can 

yield threefold or fourfold increases in output). According to the Spanish Ministry for 

Agriculture, irrigated land increased form 102,000 ha in 1995 to 372,000 ha in 2000. 

Modernization of the sector has been partly promoted by an increase in prices and a 

sharp increase in the production aid resulting from the accession to the EU and the 

application of EU regulations. Changes in dietary preferences favoring olive oil, 

specially notable since the mid 1990s, have also contributed to increased production and 

trade. However, the very intense drought suffered by Spain in 1994 and 1995 delayed 

the arrival of the new production potential to the market until after the 1996/97 

marketing year. Structural changes undergone by the sector have increased the 

economic size of the holdings. According to the Farm Accounting Data Network 

(FADN), Spanish farms specialized in olive groves increased their economic size from 



 4

about 7 European size units (ESU) in 1991 to 14 ESU in 2000. Prices perceived by 

Spanish producers have also fluctuated in accord with production. There was a rise 

following accession to the EU, which was prolonged by the draught affecting Spain 

during 1994 and 1995. However, the increase in production after the draught caused 

prices to fall. Data from the European Commission show that prices for extra virgin 

olive oil fell from 2770.4 euros per ton in 1994/95 to 1712.9 in 2000/01. Increased 

production within the EU led to the 1998 reform the EU’s Common Market 

Organization (CMO) for oils and fats in order to stabilize both production and the 

budget devoted to support the sector. This reform involved, among other changes, a 

reduction in the production aid per unit, the exclusion of new plantings from the areas 

entitled to receive production aid, the replacement of the former intervention system by 

a private storage mechanism, and the elimination of consumption aids.  

In this paper we analyze technical efficiencies and factor productivity changes 

for a sample of Spanish farms specialized in olive production. Though some previous 

published studies have addressed efficiency issues in the European agriculture (Van der 

Vlist et al., 2005; Karagiannis et al., 2003; Karagiannis et al., 2001; Tzouvelekas et al.; 

1997), to our knowledge, no previous paper has focused on the Spanish olive sector. 

The analysis of this sector is considered economically relevant for at least three reasons. 

First, because of its economic, social and environmental importance. As noted, Spain is 

the top worldwide producer and exporter of olive oil and olives. It is thus very 

interesting to assess the efficiency with which this leading sector is operating. The 

sector is also key to economic development and environment protection in less-

developed areas, being thus important to measure its firm performance. Second, the 

thorough restructuring process through which the Spanish olive sector has undergone 

during the last decades has resulted in increased production and yields. This is likely to 



 5

have altered the efficiency of operations granting research on this topic. Finally, as 

explained, though the olive sector has been excluded from the 1990s and 2000s 

decoupling-oriented CAP reforms, the tendency to replace production aids by direct 

aids should not be underestimated. In a more decoupled scenario, the efficiency with 

which olive holdings operate would be more relevant and a crucial factor in determining 

the continuity of olive holdings over time. This increases the interest of our study. 

 

 

Methodology 

 

The performance of a firm has been conventionally assessed through the concept of 

efficiency. Technical efficiency represents the capacity and willingness of an economic 

unit to produce the maximum attainable output from a given set of inputs and 

technology (Koopmans, 1951). A commonly used technique to measure a firm’s 

technical efficiency is the stochastic frontier methodology which we adopt (Aigner, 

Lovell and Schmidt, 1997; Meusen and van den Broeck, 1977). This well-known 

technique assumes that, for a given combination of inputs, the maximum attainable 

production by a firm is delimited from above by a parametric function of known inputs 

involving unknown parameters and a measurement error. The more distant actual 

production is from this stochastic frontier, the greater a firm’s technical inefficiency. A 

stochastic frontier production function formulated within a panel data context can be 

expressed as follows:  

 

( , ) it itv uit ity f x t eβ
−=   (1) 

 



 6

where ity  is the output of the i -th firm ( 1,...,i N= ) in period 1,...,t T= , ( , )itf x tβ  

represents the production technology, itx  is a 1( )K×  vector of inputs and other factors 

influencing production associated with the i -th firm in period t , β  is a 1( )K ×  vector of 

unknown parameters to be estimated, itv  is a vector of random errors that are assumed to 

be iid 20( , )vN σ , and itu  is a vector of independently distributed and nonnegative random 

disturbances that are associated with output-oriented technical inefficiencies. 

Specifically, itu  measures the extent to which actual production falls short of maximum 

attainable output. The technical efficiency of a producer at a certain point in time can be 

expressed as the ratio of actual output to the maximum potential output:

It should be noted here that the specification of the stochastic frontier in (1) allows 

technical inefficiency of a firm to change over time. Time is also included as an 

explanatory variable in the production function, which allows to measure trends in 

productivity change. Following Battese and Coelli (1995), exogenous influences are 

incorporated in the model to explain changes in producer performance. In this regard, it 

is assumed that technical inefficiency effects, the itu s, have mean itzδ  and variance 
2σ u . 

Specifically, according to these authors, the technical inefficiency term responds to the 

following pattern of behavior: it it itu zδ η= + , where itz  is a 1( )M×  vector of farm-

specific variables which may vary over time, δ  is a 1( )M ×  vector of unknown 

coefficients, and 20 ηη σ∼ ( , )it N  is a random variable defined by the truncation of the 

normal distribution such that the truncation point is - itzδ . Maximum likelihood

techniques are used for a simultaneous estimation of the stochastic frontier and the 

technical inefficiency models (see Battese and Coelli, 1993 for more details on the 

likelihood function):

Empirical application 

 

As noted above, the aim of this article is to assess technical efficiencies of the olive 

sector in Spain after the relevant changes experienced by this sector since the Spanish 

accession to the EU. We use farm-level data taken from the Farm Accounting Data 

Network for the period 1999-2002. FADN dataset annually collects micro-economic 

data from a sample of agricultural holdings in the European Union. It provides 



 9

representative data of EU agricultural holdings along three dimensions: region, 

economic size and type of farming. It should be noted however, that FADN only 

considers “professional” holdings with enough size to constitute the grower’s principal 

activity and provide enough revenue to meet his household needs. As a result, FADN 

data only represents about 65% of the Spanish holdings.  

Though the analysis is based on individual data, region and country level 

aggregates are also employed to define some variables used in the analysis. These 

aggregates are derived from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and Eurostat. The 

Spanish Ministry of Agriculture provided land prices. Eurostat provided other input and 

output price indices. Our sample is composed by 576 observations that constitute an 

unbalanced panel of data. The use of a panel of data in efficiency estimation offers 

advantages over a cross section, since it allows technical efficiencies to change both as a 

result of individual characteristics as well as a result of the passage of time.  

Following previous literature (Fan, 1991; Karagiannis and Tzouvelekas, 2001), 

the production frontier function in (1) is specified as a quasi-translog function that takes 

the form: 

 

( )
0e e

β βββ= ∏ k ktt it it
K

+ tt v -u
it kit

k=1
y x

 (6) 

 

Production, 
ity , is defined as an implicit quantity index by dividing total olive sales in 

currency units by the olive price index. Vector itx  is defined as a 1 4×( )  vector that 

contains four inputs. The first input, 1x  includes fertilizers and pesticides, 2x  comprises 

other variable specific inputs other than fertilizers and pesticides, 3x  represents the 



 10

hectares occupied by olive groves area and 4x  symbolizes labor input and is measured 

in labor hours per year. Input use variables 1x  and 2x  are expressed as implicit quantity 

indices by dividing the consumption of these inputs in currency units by their respective 

price indices. Input prices, required to carry out the total factor productivity growth 

decomposition, are not registered in FADN dataset. To define 1w  and 2w , i.e. pesticide 

and fertilizer and other variable input prices, we use national price indices taken from 

Eurostat. Labor prices are approximated by dividing a farm’s labor expenses by the 

hours of labor. Land prices are derived from the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture. All 

variables in the stochastic frontier are normalized with respect to their own mean and 

expressed in logs in the estimation process.  

 The technical inefficiency effects function is specified as a linear function 

1
δ η

=

M

u z , with 6=M . The components of itz  include a constant ( )1z , a dummy 

variable that takes the value of 1 if the holding is engaged in organic farming techniques 

and 0 otherwise ( )2z , a dummy variable equal to 1 if the holding is renting agricultural 

land and zero otherwise ( )3z , a dummy variable that indicates whether the farm is 

located in a less favored area (LFA) or not ( )4z , the birth year of the holding’s primary 

decision maker ( )5z , and time ( )6z . Organic farming practices involve changes in input 

use such as the replacement of synthetic inputs by other inputs such as labor, the use of 

crop rotation methods, etc. After discarding synthetic inputs and converting their 

operations to organic farming, farmers may experience some loss in yields. This may 

exert a negative influence on a farm’s technical efficiency. As suggested by previous 

literature (Serra, Goodwin and Featherstone, 2005), direct costs of land rentals may 

create stronger incentives to work the land in an efficient manner, relative to the 



 11

opportunity costs borne by owned land. To the extent that this occurs, 3z  is expected to 

increase a farm’s efficiency. Farms located in less favored areas are likely to suffer from 

different restrictions such as environmental constraints, low productive capacity, aged 

population, etc. that may reduce the efficiency of operations. A farmer’s age is also 

likely to influence technical efficiency, which we measure through variable 5z . Younger 

farmers should be expected to be more prone to introduce changes in crop management 

techniques that increase efficiency, relative to elderly ones. Finally, the variable time is 

also expected to influence technical efficiency. Since farm managers are likely to learn 

from their errors, the passage of time should be expected to improve technical 

efficiency. Results derived from the estimation of the model are presented in the 

following section.  

 

 

Results 

 

Results derived from simultaneously estimating the quasi-translog production frontier 

and the inefficiencies equation are presented in table 1. First-order parameters β k  are 

all positive and statistically significant thus indicating that production is increasing in 

all inputs: pesticides and fertilizers, other variable inputs, land and labour. The variance 

parameter, γ, is statistically significant and close to one, which suggests the relevance of 

technical inefficiencies in explaining output behaviour for our sample of farms. It also 

suggests that one should not rely solely on the average production function response as 

an adequate representation of the sample data. The positive sign of the technical change 

coefficient indicates that the value of output has tended to increase over the four year 

period.  



 12

Estimated δ  coefficients help us understand the determinants of our sample 

farms’ technical inefficiencies. As expected, the less-favored area coefficient is positive 

which indicates holdings facing different restrictions such as environmental constraints 

are less efficient relative to the other farms. The coefficient representing a farmer’s age 

suggests that older farmers are more inefficient in comparison to younger ones. As 

suggested above, younger farmers may be more likely to introduce efficiency-

improving changes in their holdings relative to aged ones. The organic farming 

coefficient is positive. This provides evidence that the adoption of practices that 

promote and enhance agro-ecosystems’ health involves technical efficiency gains. 

Farms renting land are shown to be more efficient relative to farms owning cultivated 

land. This provides evidence that land rentals motivate more efficient operations relative 

to the opportunity costs of owned land. The negative coefficient for the variable year 

suggests that technical inefficiencies of olive farms tended to decrease throughout the 

period studied. 

Following previous research (Coelli, 1995), we use the generalized likelihood 

ratio statistic to test for the null that inefficiency effects are absent from the model, i.e., 

1 0γ δ δ= = = =M... . The generalised likelihood-ratio statistic takes the value of 85.89, 

which allows to reject the null and supports the alternative hypothesis that Spanish olive 

farms suffer from inefficiencies. The predicted technical efficiencies take an average 

value of 69% throughout the period studied (Table 2). A majority of farmers have 

efficiency scores above 70-90% (59% of the sample), which is compatible with 

previous research findings (Karagiannis and Tzouvelekas, 2001). Consistently with 

previous research (see Battesse and Coelli 1995), the evolution of technical efficiencies 

shows a light fluctuation over time, ranging from a peak of almost 73.4% in 1999 to a 

low 65.4% in 2002. As noted above, olive production is highly dependent on weather 



 13

variables and alternate bearing that cause production per hectare to fluctuate over time1. 

Technical efficiency levels are capturing these fluctuations with higher scores obtained 

in high yield years and lower scores corresponding to low yield periods.  

Karagiannis and Tzouvelekas (2001) assessed technical efficiency levels of 

Greek farms over the period 1987-1993. A comparison of our results with these authors’ 

suggests higher levels of technical inefficiency for our sample of Spanish olive farms. 

The same conclusion is reached if one compares our results with those derived by Van 

der Vlist, Withagen and Folmer (2005) for a sample of Dutch farms specialized in 

vegetables production. This suggests that improvements in the Spanish olive productive 

capacity after the accession to the EU were not fully implemented in the period of 

analysis. This may be due to a decline in olive farm incomes as a result of a decline in 

both public subsidies after the 1998 CMO reform and a decline in output prices after the 

relevant increases in production that took place after the mid 1990s.  

Results of the TFP growth decomposition are reported in Table 3. Mean TFP 

growth rates increased through time from 0.7% in 1999 to 1.3% in 2002. As noted 

above, TFP increases can be decomposed into technical change, scale, technical 

efficiency and allocative efficiency changes. It can be seen that technical change is 

positive though very small for the period studied. The scale effect, which is bigger than 

technical changes, shows that sample farms have taken advantage of scale economies 

throughout the period of analysis. Allocative efficiencies, whose average magnitude is 

very close to the scale effect, also point towards increases in the efficiency with which 

production factors are allocated. Finally, the rate of change of technical efficiency, the 

                                                 
1 According to the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture data, yields per hectare in the 1999 to 2003 period 

fluctuated from a low 20.1 to a high 31.1. 



 14

most relevant component in the TFP growth decomposition, indicates substantial 

improvements in technical efficiencies.  

 

 

Concluding remarks 

 

Spain occupies prominent positions in worldwide rankings of olive oil and table olives 

production (with a 58% of EU and 45% of the world-wide olive production, and a 70% 

of EU and 34% of the world-wide olive table production in 2004). In this paper, we 

analyze technical efficiencies and factor productivity changes for a sample of Spanish 

farms specialized in olive production. We use a primal approach. Specifically, we 

estimate a stochastic frontier model to analyze technical efficiencies and decompose the 

productivity growth following Kumbhakar et al. (2000). An unbalanced panel of 576 

observations is used in the empirical analysis. Estimated average efficiency levels for 

our sample farms are about 69% for the period 1999-2002. A comparison of our results 

with previous research on the olive sector in Greece reveals higher levels of technical 

inefficiency for our sample of Spanish olive farms than for Greek olive farms. This 

suggests that improvements in the Spanish olive productive capacity after the accession 

to the EU were not fully implemented in the period of analysis. This may be due to 

reduced olive prices and subsidies after a period of attractive incomes following the 

Spanish accession to the EU. 

Results also indicate that the variables that affect efficiency levels are: farm 

location (i.e., whether it belongs to a less favoured area or not), age of manager, rent 

paid and whether the farm has adopted organic farming techniques. Being located in a 

less favoured area, adopting organic farming techniques or being an aged farmer is 



 15

found to decrease efficiency. On the other hand, renting land and the passage of time are 

found to increase efficiencies. As for productivity growth, results show an increase in 

average productivity of about 1.0% per year during the period of study, with technical 

efficiency change, allocative efficiencies and scale effects being the most relevant 

components of this growth.
