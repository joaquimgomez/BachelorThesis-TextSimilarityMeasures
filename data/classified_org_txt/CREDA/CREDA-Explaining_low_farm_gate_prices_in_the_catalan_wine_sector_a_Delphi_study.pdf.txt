Abstract

 As is the case with other European regions, the winegrape sector represents a conspicuous part of the Catalan agricultural and agro food sector. Wine is an essential part of the economic and social identity of Catalonia and constitutes an important aspect of the region’s landscape. While wine production has been increasing markedly over the last years, prices that winegrape producers receive have steadily declined threatening their standard of living. This has raised social and political concerns and calls for a better understanding of its causes. Our analysis attempts to comprehend the sources of such price crisis by undertaking examination of the sector by making use of a Delphi technique. We find that experts agree in considering wine surplus and imperfect price transmission as the main causes determining low farm-gate prices in the Catalan wine sector.

Introduction 
As is the case with other European countries, the winegrape sector represents a conspicuous part of the Catalan agricultural and agro food sector. Wine is an essential part of the economic and social identity of Catalonia and constitutes an important aspect of the region’s landscape. While wine production has been increasing markedly over the last years, prices that winegrape producers receive have steadily declined threatening their standard of living. The decline in farm-gate prices contrasts with the stability of consumer prices. The economic situation of the wine sector has raised social and political concerns and calls for a better understanding of its causes. 

When market mechanisms work smoothly, prices appear as the ultimate variable determining resource allocation, typically paying back marginal production costs. At the same time, prices are the primary mechanism by which different levels of the food marketing chain are related. The degree to which price changes are transmitted along this chain is usually a reflection of the level of competition within the market. Research on vertical price transmission within the food marketing chain has repeatedly reported imperfections such as asymmetries in this process (Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Serra and Goodwin, 2003; Peltzman, 2000). The literature also agrees on the fact that market conditions are largely important to understand how market imperfections work. Our analysis aims at characterizing the food marketing chain for wine products in Catalonia by quantifying the trade flows occurring within this chain. By doing so, we hope to provide useful insights on the process of price formation. Also, we aim at determining the causes of the relevant increase in wine production within the last years and assess to what extent this increase constitutes a problem for the sector. 
This study is divided in five main sections. Next section briefly describes the Catalan wine sector. Section three presents the methods employed. Section four reports the main results. The paper concludes with a summary of the results and the formulation of policy recommendations.   

The Catalan winegrape production sector
Worldwide, almost 8 million ha are dedicated to grape production and as Table 1 exhibits, the total area has slightly increased during the last decade (by about 0.8%). In contrast, the European grape harvested area, which represents about 44% of worldwide grape area, has decreased by approximately 4% in the 1999-2006 period. Following the same trend, the Spanish grape production area has declined by around 0.5%. The Spanish grape sector is important as, with almost 1.2 million hectares, represents about 34% of all European grape production area. Previous studies suggest that the European and worldwide winegrape markets qualify as being saturated and mature (Calderon and Blanco, 2005; ICEX, 2006). 
-Insert Table 1 about here-

Catalonia represents roughly 5% -63,000ha- of the Spanish grape production area (see Table 1). Although the Catalan grape area is not especially relevant in magnitude, it is indeed in quality. The Catalan winegrape sector is clearly specialized in quality wines, with around 95% of the winegrape surface being devoted to produce “Quality Wine Produced in Specific Region” (Q.W.P.S.R.). Among Catalan quality vineyards it is possible to identify as much as eleven Protected Designations of Origin[1] (PDOs). Figure 1 shows the location of the different PDOs. Penedès is the most prominent in terms of area harvested, production and sales. 
-Insert Figure 1 -
Annual Catalan wine production amounts to more than 3 million hectoliters, a 9% of Spanish wine production (Table 1). PDOs represent around 90% of Catalan wine production. Despite a slight decline in output in 2001, especially for PDOs, a considerable increase takes place in the subsequent years. Catalan wine production patterns by PDO have changed over time. While PDO Penedès, Costers del Segre and Empordà have increased their relative importance, PDO Tarragona, Conca de Barberà and Terra Alta have lost relevance (see Table 2). In order to better examine the wine sector and since white and red wine subsectors are characterized by different particularities, it is useful to distinguish between these two subsectors (see Figure 2). About 70% of Catalan wine production is devoted to white wine, a fact that can be explained by the relevance of Cava (sparkling wine) in Catalonia. Consistently with the evolution of total wine production, both white and red wine output increased during the first half of the 2000s. 

-Insert Table 2 and Figure 2 about here-

Trends in consumption show a different picture as Figure 3 illustrates. Although worldwide consumption has increased since the end of the 1990s (International Organization of Vine and Wine - OIV), Spanish and Catalan demands have slightly decreased. Moreover, Spanish consumption is more focused on non-Catalan PDOs such as Rioja and Ribera del Duero (Ac Nielsen, 2006).  Another remarkable issue arising from Figure 3 is that Catalan production exceeds consumption by far. 
-Insert Figure 3 about here-


The fact that production surpasses consumption explains the positive Catalan wine trade balance. In particular, wine imports within the last years (1999-2005) have been around 38 million euros, whereas exports have represented about 340 million euros (Cámaras de Comercio). Currently, however, exports are growing more slowly than imports. This can be explained by changing consumer preferences and increased competition from other countries. Catalonia imports mainly from France, Portugal, Italy, Chile and Germany and exports to Germany, the USA, the UK and Sweden. 


The excess production over consumption together with an increase in imports have had clear effects on prices. While consumer prices have not experienced noteworthy changes, farm-gate prices have significantly declined (see Figure 4). The fact that a reduction in the farm-gate price does not translate into lower prices for wine suggests the existence of imperfect price transmission within the food marketing chain. Paradoxically, low grape prices have not involved a reduction in grape production, which would have contributed to re-equilibrate the market. On the contrary, producers seem to have responded to low market prices by increasing output levels. This is consistent with producers aiming at stabilizing their income.
-Insert Figure 4 about here-

The decline in farm-gate prices has squeezed winegrape producers’ margins and threatens their standard of living. Our analysis aims at better understanding the reasons that have led to the present crisis situation, as well as the causes that motivate an imperfect price transmission within the marketing chain. To do so, it is important to better comprehend the overall functioning of the food chain and identify the causes of late production increases. A Delphi survey is used to assess these issues.  
Data and methods 
As noted above, in a perfectly competitive market, the price of the final product should result from adding the marginal costs incurred by agents at each level of the marketing chain. However, market imperfections such as information asymmetry, market power, menu costs and search costs in local markets (Serra and Goodwin 2003) may lead to imperfect transmission of prices along the chain. In agricultural markets this has been reported to be a serious concern. The recent evolution of winegrape and wine prices suggests that imperfect price transmission may also be present within the Catalan wine marketing chain
 In order to gain a better understanding of price formation, it is necessary to have a deeper knowledge of the overall functioning of the marketing chain. Since there are no available statistical data on this issue, the Delphi method has been considered as particularly relevant in providing the required information. The Delphi method has been successfully applied to examine different issues in a large variety of disciplines such as health (Milholland et at., 1973; Schoeman and Mahajan, 1977; and Oranga and Nordberg, 1993), policy discussion (Critcher and Gladstone, 1998), or agriculture. In this latter discipline, the Policy Delphi has been used to examine Spanish olive oil exports (Mili and Rodríguez, 2001)[2], the marketing of organic products (Padel and Midmore, 2005), the Finnish agricultural policy (Rikkonen et al., 2006) or the biotechnology and agro-food sector (Agrafiotis and vagianou-Angelaki, 1999).
The Delphi survey technique was first introduced in the early 1950’s and initially oriented to deal with technical topics so as to reach a consistent opinion for a complex issue (Listone, 2002). Indeed, we do not use the conventional Delphi survey but a specific type named “Policy Delphi”. The so called “Policy Delphi” is a tool for analysis of policy areas from the standpoint of experts; accordingly, rather than an objective method to measure effects  and causes of a specific phenomenon it  provides qualitative information that cannot be elicited through other methods. The objective of our Delphi analysis is to reveal all the possible reasons that could explain current low farm-gate prices within the Catalan wine sector by achieving a consensus among experts (Listone, 2002). 
The survey was performed during 2005 and involved several stages. First, we selected an expert panel among different candidates from a long list of market agents. The selected panel was composed of 27 experts, all of them professionals belonging to different levels of the wine supply chain (grape producers, wine industry, wholesalers and retailers). Three rounds were enough to obtain both the information needed as well as to increase the degree of consensus among experts. As for the first round, a preliminary questionnaire was sent and returned by mail. After this first reply, a second questionnaire was developed and completed also by mail. Finally, a third phase was carried out by means of expert face to face interviews, in order to contrast the results obtained in the second step. Respondents included about 63% of the panel and still represented all supply chain stages. 
The first-round survey was based on open questions aiming at identifying the main problems related to the sector. Based on the reported replies we built the second Delphi questionnaire. This second-round consisted of a closed questionnaire where respondents were asked to carry out quantitative and qualitative evaluations of different issues in order to better define and suggest solutions to the main problems detected in the first round. Finally, second-round replies were ordered and structured using a third-round where respondents were asked to agree or disagree with the obtained results. Since no significant disagreements among respondents were observed, a fourth questionnaire appeared as unnecessary.   

Results and discussion 

a. First Round: Main wine sector problems expert assessment.  

Since the wine supply chain is slightly complex and in order to gain a deeper understanding of the problems affecting the sector, in the first-round experts were inquired about the specific problems related to the different stages of wine production. In particular, they were questioned about the problems regarding grape production, wine production, the structure of the sector, wine marketing within the domestic market, wine exports and, finally, other general problems. Results are presented in Table 3. 
Respondents identify the lack of payment differentiation between quality and non-quality grapes as being the main problem related to winegrape production, likely to be originated by over-production of quality grapes. Other deficiencies related to the national vineyard restructuring plan, a supply management policy, are identified. Experts consider inadequate restructuring schedules and grape varieties as the main shortcomings related to this plan. Finally, respondents believe that the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is unable to preserve supply-demand equilibrium.
-Insert Table 3 about here- 
As for wine production, the use of concentrated and rectified grape juice and sugar are the main problems. Both practices may allow middlemen in the marketing chain to pay reduced prices for winegrapes. Increases in wine imports follow in relevance amplifying the excess supply problem. As exhibited in Table 3, the main structural deficiencies of the wine sector are a lack of interprofessional agreements, a low degree of vertical integration, and an insufficient entrepreneurial dimension for international competition. Moreover, respondents believe that too many intermediaries exist within the wine supply chain and that margins within it are excessive. Wine marketing within national markets suffers from four main problems: restaurants’ high margins and prices, hard competition from Spanish and other wines, low and seasonal demand for Catalan wines both in Catalonia and in Spain and finally poor national marketing structures. Another shortcoming emphasized by respondents is the existence of too many Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) within Catalonia. Indeed, Barrère (2007) identifies that in Spain, Italy and France competition and segmentation is basically among PDO wines instead of between PDO and other wines. Therefore, the main objective of this certification, differentiation by quality, loses significance. Finally, export limitations are also identified in Table 3. The low promotion of Catalan wines in foreign markets represents, according to experts, the main shortcoming affecting the sector which is related to the lack of collaborative agreements among different PDOs. Poor market structures, a slow down in exports expansion and ignorance of foreign markets have also been considered by experts as key problems for international wine marketing. 
First-round survey results allow to identify three main reasons that motivate declining farm prices while consumer prices remain constant: excess production, deficient marketing structures and imperfect price transmission along the marketing chain. In order to gain a deeper understanding of these problems we defined a second-round Delphi questionnaire.  As for excess production, we directly inquire experts on the issue.  With regards to price transmission and marketing structures we characterize the marketing chain so as to identify possible causes of why prices are not moving smoothly.  
b. Second and third rounds
b.1. Characterizing the supply chain.

A first objective of this second round is to provide a better understanding of the wine supply chain. To do so, we attempt to quantify trade flows for both red and white wines which have two independent marketing chains. To that end, we included in the questionnaire a supply chain diagram with empty data in order to be completed (see Figures 5 and 6). Experts were asked to determine the percentage of output flowing to each different agent in each marketing level. According to their answers, wine supply chains can be characterized as follows. 
i) Red Wine 

Following expert opinions, Catalan young red wine is made from about 90% Catalan grape and 10% concentrated grape juice.  A 17% of this red young wine will be diverted towards the production of non-quality wine which can be mixed with imported wine. Our panel of experts estimates that non-quality red wine produced in Catalonia is composed of about 75% Catalan young wine and 25% imported wine. On the other hand, about 83% of Catalan young wine is devoted towards the production of PDO. From this, more than a 30% is directed to an aging process and the remaining is consumed as bottled young wine with PDO. 
- Insert Figure 5 about here- 

On the basis of expert responses, it can be concluded that the Catalan red wine industry produces four key products: bulk wine without PDO (8%), bottled wine without PDO (13%), bottled young wine with PDO (54.5%) and finally aged wine with PDO (24.5%). Moreover, it seems clear that there are four main wine market destinations: 29% of Catalan red wine production is exported, whereas 71% is domestically consumed.  From what is domestically consumed, 42% is distributed by supermarkets, 38% is consumed in restaurants and finally 20% is sold in wine stores (see Figure 7). From what is exported, 50% is young wine with PDO, about 26% is aged wine with PDO and the rest is non-quality wine. 
-Insert Figure 7 about here- 

From what supermarkets distribute, about 60% is young wine with PDO, 20% aged wine with PDO and the rest is non-quality certified wine. With regards to wine stores, around 70% of their sales consist of young wine with PDO and the rest is mainly aged wine with PDO. Finally, almost half of Catalan wine consumed in a restaurant is young wine with PDO, followed by more than 20% of aged wine with PDO and the rest is non-quality wine.
ii) White wine

Following experts, Catalan young white wine is made from about 88% Catalan grape and 12% concentrated grape juice. A 19% of Catalan white young wine is devoted to the production of non-quality wine which can be mixed with imported wine from outside Catalonia. Questionnaire results suggest that white Catalan wine without quality certification is composed of about 79% Catalan young wine and 21% imported wine. On the other hand, about 81% of Catalan young white wine is directed to the production of PDOs. From this, a 30% is routed to an aging process, 18% is consumed as bottled young wine with PDO and the remaining 59% is directed to Cava production (see Figure 6). 
-Insert Figure 6 about here- 

The Catalan white wine industry produces four key products: bulk wine without PDO (10%), bottled wine without PDO (9%), bottled young wine with PDO (18%), Cava (59%) and finally aged wine with PDO (4%). Moreover, our results also indicate that there are four main destinations for white wine: exports, supermarkets, wine store and restaurants. A 39% of Catalan white wine production is exported, whereas 61% is domestically consumed.  From what is domestically consumed, 44% is distributed by supermarkets, 36% is consumed in restaurants and finally 20% is sold in wine stores.

As Figure 7 shows, from what is exported, 12% is young wine with PDO, around 3% is aged wine with PDO, about 65% is Cava and the rest is non-quality wine. Moreover, from what supermarkets distribute, about 58% is Cava, 22% is young wine with PDO, 4% aged wine with PDO and the rest is non-quality wine. Regarding wine stores, around 67% of their sales consist of Cava, followed by a 25% of young wine with PDO and the remaining 8% mainly represented by aging wine with PDO. Finally, it must be said that almost half of Catalan white wine consumed in restaurants is Cava, young wine with PDO represents about 20%, only 5% is aged wine with PDO and the rest is non-quality wine.
From both red and white wine diagrams, it is noteworthy the quantity of wine that is redirected from non-quality to quality wine. Approximately a 25% of white wine that initially enters the non-quality marketing chain is readdressed towards the production of PDO wine. The same occurs to approximately 23% of red wine. This contributes to understand the price behavior observed in the sector: while a portion of grapes enter the distribution channel as non-quality grapes and thus receive lower prices relative to quality grapes, they are finally transferred towards the production of quality wines that will obtain high retail prices.

It is also important to emphasize the role of cooperatives within the Catalan wine sector. Following expert quantifications, around half of Catalan grape production is controlled by cooperatives. While cooperatives play an undoubtedly relevant role, affiliation in the wine sector is lower relative to other food products and countries. For example, almost a 70% of the milk produced within the EU-15 is marketed through cooperatives (Foro Agrario, 2000). Indeed, in 2003 within the ten main European cooperatives in terms of revenue, four specialize in dairy. In contrast, no wine cooperative exists within the raking (Confederación general de cooperativas agrarias de la UE, COGECA, 2005). The situation is not much different in Spain, where fruits and vegetables and olive oil cooperatives abound while wine cooperatives are scarce (CGEA, 2005).  Spain had 625 wine cooperatives in 2003, not much compared to the 900 located in France, a direct competitor of Spain. Moreover, French cooperatives’ turnover per year is almost twice that of Spanish ones (COGECA, 2005). Catalonia has around 77 wine cooperatives, a 12% of total Spanish wine cooperatives (MAPA, 2004), which is compatible with Catalan wine production representing around 10% of the Spanish production.  Low cooperative market shares coupled with an overall lack of marketing contracts within the wine sector involve reduced farmer negotiating power in price determination. In addition, from the experts standpoint, cooperatives are more relevant within the white wine than the red wine chain. This can explain the higher stability presented by white wine farm-gate prices relative to red wine (see Figure 4).  

Finally, the role of supermarkets on price determination, which have certainly higher power than the one exerted by small shops and restaurants, must also be considered.  Indeed, excluding exports, supermarkets distribute almost half of Catalan wine. Supermarkets may be more reluctant to reprice their products than small specialty shops since the costs of doing so are higher. This involves that low farm prices may not be immediately transferred to consumers. Consequently, supermarket power may also contribute to explain why retail prices have remained more or less constant wile farm-gate prices have diminished. 
b.2 Qualitative evaluation of the Catalan wine surplus
This section aims at eliciting qualitative information on the prospects and situation of the Catalan wine sector production surplus. In order to better characterize the situation and predict its future evolution, experts were first asked to forecast both Catalan wine production and consumption -based on available data for previous years- (see Tables 4 and 5), and the overall economic situation of the sector within the next five years (see Figure 8). Moreover, they were also requested to qualify the production surplus situation as temporary or permanent (see Figure 9). Finally, the reasons that can motivate excess supply in the Catalan wine sector were also identified (see Figures 10, 11 and 12). From expert responses we can conclude the following: 
Experts predict a slight increase in both Catalan vineyard area and wine production. They also expect the current tendency towards quality wine specialization to continue (see Table 4).  With regards to demand, respondents suggest that Catalans will slightly increase their consumption of PDO wines, while reducing the use of non-quality wines (see Table5). 
-Insert Tables 4 and 5 about here- 

In addition, there is an agreement among experts with regards to considering the white wine and the Cava sectors as mainly stable sectors. However, some respondents point to moderate expansion or recession. Agreement among experts is less with regards to the economic forecast of the red wine sector. About 33% of the panel foresees a moderate expansion in the next future, 33% believes the sector to be stable, 20% considers the possibility of a moderate recession and finally a 13% considers the likelihood of an important recession (see Figure 8).
-Insert Figure 8 about here- 
Indeed, a majority of panel members define the current production surplus situation as permanent for white and red wines. Although there is no agreement for the case of Cava, about 29% of the panel considers the situation as being temporary, 39% as structural and finally 32% as permanent (see Figure 9). 
-Insert Figure 9 about here- 

Finally, we elicited from experts the causes of Catalan wine surplus differentiating between red wine, white wine and cava. We presented the experts with a list of possible causes and asked them to evaluate each proposition from 0 to 10. Figures 10, 11 and 12 present the top eleven surplus causes according to expert assessment. Interestingly, there was an agreement among expert panel members that the main causes of production surplus are the lack of coordination and poor vertical integration in the overall Catalan wine sector.  
Excessive production returns due to a soft supply regulation and the inability of the Common Market Organization (CMO) for wine to preserve the market equilibrium have also been considered as a possible origin of wine surplus. Other regulation-related causes are also identified, such as low support from the government towards the wine sector and low public control of farm cooperatives and industry in general. Furthermore, export market limitations have also been highlighted by experts as a reason for wine surplus. Indeed, survey respondents reveal that Catalan export marketing strategy is not effective enough and encounters difficulties to compete with other low-price quality wines such as Australian and Argentinean wines. Finally, the tendency to increase production in a context of price declines so as to maintain farm income has also been considered as an important factor. 
-Insert Figures 10, 11 and 12 about here- 
Discussion and conclusions
The Catalan wine sector is currently immersed in a crisis situation characterized by excess production and low farm-gate prices. The tendency of farm-gate prices to decline contrasts with the stability displayed by consumer prices. This study has attempted to determine the underlying causes of this situation. Catalonia is one of the main European quality wine producing areas and the evidence presented in this analysis can provide some insights relevant for further econometric and theoretical analysis.  
First-round results from the Delphi study agree in considering excess production, deficient marketing structures and imperfect price transmission as the main causes determining low farm-gate prices in the Catalan wine sector. We then orientate the second and third rounds of the analysis towards providing a deeper understanding of both the causes motivating excess production and the overall functioning of the marketing chain.  

Results suggest that although marketing chains for white and red wines are different, they present similar characteristics that suggest the existence of imperfect vertical price transmission. Specifically, while a portion of grapes are paid and enter the distribution channel as non-quality winegrapes, they are later on redirected towards the production of PDO wine. Also, the role of cooperatives, though relevant in absolute terms, is smaller relative to other food sectors. These facts coupled with the relevant role played by supermarkets that usually exert strong market power contribute to understand why farm-gate prices decline while consumer prices remain stable. 
Other causes are identified by experts in the first-round qualitative assessment as causing imperfect price transmission along the marketing chain. These causes are the low development of contractual regimes among agents, poor vertical integration and abnormal margins among certain distributors. Moreover, experts reveal that, even though the public administration is aware of this, very limited efforts are put forward to help the sector to prevent it. Interestingly, experts suggest as possible solutions the promotion of vertical integration from farm to retailer and an increase in the coordination within the sector so as to obtain a cooperative rather than a competitive solution. This implies reducing the number of intermediaries and promoting a high level of professionalization within the sector.
Qualitative results from the Delphi study allow to point out the main causes responsible for the current production surplus affecting the sector: the lack of coordination and poor market integration in the overall Catalan wine sector, deficiencies in the public regulation of the sector, a slow down in exports and domestic sales and finally an increase in production so as to maintain farm income levels in a context of price declines. Interestingly, experts identify this situation as being a structural phenomenon for white and red wine whilst for Cava it seems to be only a temporary state. 
The slow down in demand both at the national and international levels seems to result from poor knowledge of Catalan wines which limits the possibilities to penetrate the markets. Some experts argue in favor of promoting an agreement among PDOs regarding promotional strategies along with supports from public authorities. Furthermore, restrictive supply regulations are seen as necessary means to cut down production surplus.

[1] These designations are Alella, Catalunya (recently created), Conca de Barberà, Costers del Segre, Empordà-Costa Brava, Montsant, Penedès, Pla del Bages, Priorat, Tarragona and Terra Alta. Cava (sparkling wine) is another important PDO in Catalonia. Although it is not circumscribed to this autonomous community, 95% of its production is located there.  

[2] Other upublished papers using the Delphi technique to analize the Spanish agricultural sector are Salazar and Sayadi (2006) and Soliño (2003).
