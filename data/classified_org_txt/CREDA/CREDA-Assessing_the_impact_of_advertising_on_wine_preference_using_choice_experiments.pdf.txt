Extended Abstract

Our paper seeks to assess the imapct of information and advertising on consumers’ preference for wines during Christmas in Catalonia (Spain). We apply the Discrete Choice Experiments using a hybrid Conditional Logit model introducing the interaction of wines’ attributes with publicity variable. Two questionnaires have been applied to a pre and post spot samples formed by 300 and 400 individuals respectively. Results suggest that the proposed spot does not make any change in the ranking of the preferred attributes. However, the magnitude of the willingness to pay for some attributes has revealed some differences. The most preferred attribute is the Catalan origin of the wine followed by the Cabernet Sauvignon variety. Moreover, consumers tend to acquire wines for Christmas that are recommended by third persons.
Information and advertising usually play an important role in defining consumers’ preferences, since they could affect the decision to acquire products. In this context, information’ perception is heterogeneous across individuals and should be treated adequately. Misunderstanding this fact could lead to biased welfare measurements across individuals. Several choice experiment studies have analyzed preference heterogeneity by using different modeling approaches that allow including exogenous variables in explaining preferences such as advertising. We highlight among others alternatives the Latent Class models “LC” (Boxall and Adamowicz, 2002; Milon and Scorgin, 2006; Ouma et al., 2007 and Jones and Hencher, 2007), the Random Parameter Logit models “RPL” (Birol et al. 2006; Brey et al., 2007; and Wang, et al., 2007) and the Mixed or Hybrid Conditional Logit models “CL” (Mazzanti, 2003; Kallas et al., 2007; Colombo et al., 2007; Birol and Cox, 2007; Campbell, 2007 and Espino et al., 2008).
In our study we apply a Hybrid Conditional Logit model in order to assess the impact of advertising via a specific spot, on wines’ preferences in Catalonia during Christmas. The hybrid CL models have been applied by introducing the interaction of all attributes levels with a dummy variable representing the publicity spot. The utility function used has the following form:


Where,
i = 1…I, representing the selected alternative i within the set of alternatives (Cn);
k = 1…K, representing the attributes which characterize alternative j;
(k = population mean impact of attribute k for individual n choosing alternative i;
Xki = value of attribute k in alternative i,
Xki × P = combined effect of attribute k in alternative i (Xki) by dummy variable representing the advertisement effect,

(kp = coefficient of interaction between the attribute k and dummy variable P.
The attributes and levels of wines were identified on the basis of a previous pilot questionnaire and other focus groups realized in the university. These are shown in Table 1.

Following an orthogonal fractional factorial design, we estimate all attributes’ main effects. This statistical design enables us to reduce the number of sets from the initial 34x34 in the full design to 9 choice sets. Figure 1 shows one of these sets.

The results of the hybrid conditional model are shown in Table 2. Overall, the model is highly significant and shows a good fit when comparing the log likelihood at zero and at convergence

For the economic interpretation we calculate the Implicit Prices (IP) for each attribute and their confidence intervals following the Krinsky and Robb’s (1986) procedure. Almost all implicit prices in Table 3 are statistically different from zero. Moreover, comparing pre and post results, the proposed spot has demonstrated a null impact on attributes ranking between the two samples. However, there are some differences in the magnitude of implicit prices for some attributes as shown in Table 3.

Note 1: IP are measured in €, which is the willingness to pay for each attribute’ levels.

Note 2: Readers can consult the key and meaning of each variable in Table 1.

Moreover, our results allow calculating the differences in marginal utilities for the different levels. Thus the willingness to pay to pass from one level to another can be obtained. In Table 4 it can be seen that there are some differences in the implicit values. However, both the sign and the ranking of the willingness to pay reveal some differences.

Note 1: IP are measured in €, which is the willingness to pay for changing from the level to another of the attributes.
The estimation of the indirect utility functions could turn out to be useful in analyzing preference. Thus, the use of choice experiments has been revealed to be able to assess the impact of advertising on attributes preferences in the case of wine during Christmas.
