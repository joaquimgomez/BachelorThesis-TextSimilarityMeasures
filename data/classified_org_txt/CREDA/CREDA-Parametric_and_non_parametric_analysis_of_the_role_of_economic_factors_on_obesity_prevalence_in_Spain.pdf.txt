1. Introduction 

Poor diets and rising obesity rates dominate the current food, nutrition and health 
policy debate in many countries, including Spain.  Obesity is partly a result of an energy 
imbalance caused by consumption of too many calories and/or low expenditures of 
calories (i.e., low physical activity) over a considerable period. Consequently, most 
published economic research has examined the increased growth of obesity rates by 
analyzing several factors that may contribute to this imbalance of caloric consumption 
and usage (see Cutler et al., 2003; Chou et al., 2004; Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2007; 
Philipson and Posner, 1999; Loureiro and Nayga, 2005).  

Due to rising concerns about obesity, the availability, accessibility and choice of 
foods to meet an adequate diet are becoming key challenges to our food system today.  
Good nutrition is essential to obtaining optimum health and productivity and in 
reducing the risk for chronic and infectious diseases. Understanding factors influencing 
food consumption and obesity is needed to gain a clearer picture of the mechanisms that 
would cause individuals to eat unhealthful or become over weighted.  Hence, 
knowledge about how people make food choices and how economic and non-economic 
factors influence food consumption and obesity is critically important to improve policy 
interventions and developing agricultural and food programs that can assure a safe, 
affordable, reliable and nutritious food supply and promote health. 

Previous economic studies have analyzed the role played by income on health. In 
general, there seems to be a consensus about the positive effect of income on health 
(Smith, 1999). Consequently, we would expect, all things being equal, a negative effect 
on obesity, although this may not be necessarily the case, since obesity is in some 
cultures a sign of status and wealth. Furthermore, several recent economic studies 
explain the role played by different cultural and socio-demographic factors on obesity 
rates. Leaving genetics aside, obesity is caused by consumption of too much calories 
and/or low expenditures of calories (i.e. low physical activity). For example, Schlosser 
(2002) showed that the fast growth of fast food and soda drinks has increased the 
dietary intake of saturated fats, sugars, and calories and then, the prevalence of obesity. 
Other researchers argue that female labour participation is a leading factor in increasing 
obesity rates (Garcia et al., 2006), mainly in childhood.  

Most of the literature in Spain has concentrated on the adequacy of alternative 
instruments to measure obesity or on educational and environmental factors (i.e. food 
consumption) affecting obesity. However, up to now, limited attention has been paid to 
the role of economic factors (income and prices) on food choices, physical activity and, 
consequently, on the prevalence of obesity. 

Despite the increasing obesity rate in Spain, there has been no known published 
research in Spain that has analyzed the economic factors affecting food consumption, 
the quality of diet and obesity.  The main aim of our work is analyzing the relevance of 
economic factors (mainly income and other socioeconomic characteristics of Spanish 
households and market prices) on the prevalence of obesity in Spain and to what extent 
market intervention prices are effective to reduce obesity and improve diet quality and 
under what circumstances. 

Our methodological approach depending upon the estimation of a multinomial 
logit model Combined with the estimation of a non-parametric model, the Multivariate 



Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), to judge the role of different socioeconomic 
factors on the obesity prevalence in Spain. Despite the desirable advantages of the use 
of non-parametric models such as MARS, our paper is the first attempt to use this type 
of models to analyze the determinant factors of obesity prevalence.  

Our data come from the 2006 National Health Survey (NHS), the last survey 
available at national level. In order to take into account the effect of economic factors 
we augment the data set with regional consumer price indices for food, the food away-
from-home index and the regional disposable income index. Our data set consists of 
25459 adults (16 years old or more).     

To achieve the paper’ objective, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 provides a brief description on the obesity prevalence in Spain. The 
methodological approach applied in our analysis is explained in section 3. Our empirical 
application and the main results are discussed in sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, 
the paper ends with some concluding remarks. 

2. Obesity prevalence in Spain 

Following the 2006 National Health Survey (NHS) the prevalence of overweight 
and obesity among Spanish adults aged 18 years old or more was about 37.13% and 
15.37% respectively. While the prevalence of obesity was quite similar between men 
and women (15.6% among men and 15.2% among women), the overweight prevalence 
was quite higher in men representing almost 44.7% in men and only 29.4 in women. 
The lowest obesity prevalence rate in both men and women detected in the youngest 
category including people aged between 18 and 24 years with a prevalence rate of about 
5.4% for both genders. Elder people aged between 65 and 74 years was the category 
with the highest rate of obesity prevalence among the two genders with a prevalence 
rate of 25.5% and 28.3% among men and women, respectively. Also the prevalence of 
obesity was higher in persons with no education than in those with higher education. 
The prevalence of obesity in Spain has increased at an alarming rate in 20 years as it has 
passed from 6.9% and 7.9% in men and women, respectively, in 1987, to the above 
mentioned 15.6% and 15.2%, in 2006. 

3. Methodological approach 

Few studies have used multinomial logit model to analyze the determinant factors 
of obesity prevalence (see Cavaliere and Banterle, 2008; Warner, 2003; Asfaw, 2007 
among others). Previous studies found that age has a positive effect on obesity 
prevalence and that overweight prevalence rate was higher among men than among 
women while in the case of obesity prevalence the opposite trend has been found 
(Miljkovic et al., 2008).A substantial percentage of studies has found that obesity is 
more frequent among low social classes and among adults with non or low education 
levels (Loureiro and Nayga, 2005). However, only in a very limited number of studies 
food prices have been considered as a main determinant of obesity prevalence 
(Schroeter and lusk, 2005 among others). This paper is one of the first attempts to 
consider this issue. Moreover, it is the first attempt to conducting this analysis in Spain. 
From methodological point of view, this paper compares the results obtained from the 
use of parametric and non parametric models to tackle with this issue. While previous 
literature has focused in parametric methods, like the multinomial logit we use the 



Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), which is flexible enough to provide 
more insight on how covariates interact with the prevalence of obesity. In the next 
section we provide a brief description of MARS models. 

MARS Model 

MARS is a non-parametric regression technique developed by Friedman 
(Friedman, 1991). MARS allows covariates to enter in the model as a single variable or 
as interacting with other covariates generating unbiased parameter estimations with 
strong algorithms. MARS could be viewed as a generalization of the repeated 
discriminate method and stepwise linear regression to improve the performance of a 
covariate set. This method first divides data into locales and then forms a regression 
equation for each one. Each obtained linear region is called “knot”.  

MARS uses both forward and backward progresses for robust and unbiased 
parameter estimations. It starts by maximizing all possible effects of explanatory 
variables in the forward model and then removes the least effective functions in the 
backward model using Ordinary Least Squares method.  

The main advantage of MARS comparing with other regressions such as logistic 
regression is that MARS is a data driven technique. Instead of fitting a single regression 
equation for the model, MARS get many piecewise regression equations which allow 
the researcher to obtain more consistent and unbiased estimates of the covariates.  

The main principle of MARS is based on searching for every point where linearity 
breaks. Then this point is taken as a knot and extrapolative variables, which have an 
effect until that point, are modeled using a new regression equation. Then, the number 
of obtained regression equations is the same as the number of knots defined in the 
process. MARS reaches the final model taking the obtained combination of basic 
functions into account (these functions are called Basis Functions) based on minimizing 
the Generalized cross validation (GCV) (Kayri, 2007).1 MARS uses GCV to compare 
the performance of obtained models. lower values of GCV are better. The GCV can be 
considered as a form of regularization by trading off between goodness-of-fit against 
model complexity. For MARS models we cannot use the raw residual sum of squares 
(RSS) for comparing models, because the RSS always increases as MARS terms are 
dropped which means that if the RSS were used to compare models the backward step 
of model construction would always choose the largest model. 

As it is designed, this method overcomes the shortcoming of other nonparametric 
methods by obtaining readable regression curves and generates unbiased parameter 
estimates by using the split method and a solution approach (Deconinckb et al., 2008).  

The main disadvantage of MARS is the low prediction power with insufficient 
sample size. This is not the case in our analysis as we have a quite big data set. 
Moreover, Briand et al. (2007) mentioned that the model may suffer from 
multicollinearities as MARS gets interaction between predictive variables involved in 
the model.

4. Empirical application 

Our data come from the 2006 National Health Survey (NHS). The NHS is a cross-
section survey that provides micro data on the health status of citizens and its 
determinants. It is carried out by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) in cooperation 
with the Ministry of Health and Consumption. The survey collects information on the 
individual socioeconomic characteristics, morbidity, food habits and the demand for 
health care of respondents. Food habits refer to two main issues: type of breakfast and 
frequency of consumption of selected food groups. However, the data set does not 
provide information on quantities consumed (or purchased) neither on prices. In order to 
take into account the effect of economic factors we augment the data set with regional 
consumer price indices for food, the food away-from-home index and the regional 
disposable income index. Our data set consists of 25459 adults (16 years old or more). 
Table 1 show some descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis.

We have distinguished between calculated body mass index (CBMI) which we 
have calculated using the reported weight and height collected from the participants and 
perceived (PBMI) which is reported directly by the participants. Both indices are split in 
the same categories for the purpose of making comparisons feasible. Categorical 
variables have been used also to reduce the potential bias in BMI estimates as it is not 
measured but self reported. Table 2 compares statistics for CBMI and PBMI.

Obese  4063 15.96 2117 8.33 

Total  25459 100 25402 100 

 

As our dependent variables are categorical and unordered, first, we have estimated 
a multinomial logit model (see Greene, 2003). To overcome the shortcoming of using 
parametric models when the relation between variables is non-linear or when there is an 
interaction between covariates we have estimated two MARS models taking CBMI and 
PBMI as dependent variables with the same covariates than in the parametric model. 
However, in the case of the nonparametric we have jointly considered overweight and 
obese people. In other words, the dependent variable is binary taking the value one if 
the person is overweight or obese, and zero, otherwise.  

 

5. Results 

Main results from the multinomial logit model suggest that regarding the 
Calculated Body Mass Index (CBMI) all variables except prices have a significant 
marginal effect on the probability of being overweight, being the most relevant the sex 
(men) (in a positive way) and disposable income (negative effect). In the equation 
corresponding to obesity, all variables have a significant marginal effect on the 
probability of being obese. Parameter estimates from the model with the Perceived 
Body Mass Index (PBMI), as the dependent variable, seem to be less significant and, in 
some cases with some marginal effects with a non-expected sign. 

It is also interesting to note that there are significant differences between the 
calculated BMI and the perceived BMI with a correlation coefficient between both two 
of only 0.45. Table 3 presents estimates and marginal effects of CBMI and PBMI.

Let us now concentrate on the results obtained from the non parametric approach. 
Figure 1 represents the minimized MSE of GCV for the CBMI and PBMI which use to 
choose the optimum number of base functions. As it was explained above in the 
backward step the best model is used by minimizing the GCV. It can be observed that 
the MARS model of CBMI reached the final model with 11 basis function while the 
MARS model with PBMI reached the best model with only 10 basis functions. Annex 1 
represents the basis functions and the final model for both CBMI and PBMI MARS 
models respectively.

From estimated parameters, we can calculate the variable importance of covariates 
in each model (CBMI and PBMI). Tables 6 and 7 summarize main results. As can be 
observed, the variables age, male, doing physical exercise, income and having a good 
health are important in both models, while in the case of PBMI also having a complete 
breakfast and relative food prices to consume both at home and away from home are 
important. As in the parametric logit models best performance has been obtained in the 
CBMI equation relative to the PBMI.

As mentioned above, the MARS method is more flexible as, among other issues, 
does not impose linearity between the dependent variable and its covariates. In fact, 
results obtained from the MARS model are quite similar to those obtained in the 
parametric approach, when the relationship is linear, but significant differences have 
been found when this is not the case. Moreover, we have found more consistency with 
expected results in the case of variables that have a non-linear relationship (i.e. age). 
While in the parametric multinomial logit the age does not have a significant effect on 
the prevalence of obesity, in the MARS it is the most important variable. The different 
results between logit and MARS model is owing to the non linear nature of the data in 
figure 2 we can see some example of this non linear nature. In 2A it can be observed 
that in CBMI MARS model the age has two patterns for people has more and less than 
65 years for the whole sample. In 2B we can see similar relation but with the knot 
located at 32 years and only for males. 2C and 2D represent these non linear 
relationships for the PBMI in the case of age and income.

Another interesting result from MARS models is the three dimension figures 
which can help in understanding the interaction between the different independent 
variables. Figure 3 represents some examples of these three dimension figures for both 
models. 3A and 3B represent the joint effect of age and income and the conjoint effect 
of being a male and having a complete breakfast respectively for CBMI model, while 
3C represent the same joint effect as 3B but for PBMI and 3D represents the conjoint 
effect of prices of food at and out of home for the PBMI model. In figure 3A it can be 
observed that higher disposable income resulted in higher obesity prevalence only in 
young people while higher income has an opposite effect in the case of elders and 
because of that the lowest obesity prevalence can be observed among older people with 
higher income level. In figure 3B we can see that being a male leads to a higher obesity 
prevalence rate and not having a complete breakfast enhances a little bid this effect 
while the smallest obesity prevalence rate observed in the case of women that have a 
complete breakfast. Regarding the PBMI MARS model figure 3C shows that being a 
male and having a complete breakfast lowers heavily the perception of being obese or 
overweighed while not having a breakfast does not have a significant effect on the 
perceived obesity. Figure 3Dindicated that increase food at home prices and decrease 
out of home prices increased the perceived obesity rate while decreasing food at home 
prices and increase out of home prices has an opposite effect on the perceived obesity.

6. Concluding remarks 

There are significant differences between CBMI and PBMI. For instance while 
about 16% of the sample are obese only about 8% recognize it, which emphasize the 
need of educational policies to increase awareness about this issue. Economic factors 
seem to have a significant impact on the prevalence of obesity. In general, increasing 
prices, being male, being older and have a bad health increase the probability of being 
obese. On the other hand, increasing income, doing sufficient physical exercise and 
having a more completed breakfast decrease the probability of being obese. The most 
limiting point of this type of analysis is the data availability. 

MARS models outperform the traditional multinomial logit and could be a helpful 
tool for understanding the nature of the relationship and the importance of the different 
variables to be introduced into the model. 

Although our study gives a first look on the effect of economic factors on the 
prevalence obesity, at the same time it opens number of interesting future research lines 
such as: Use different years of the NHS estimating a panel data model, Combine the 
NHS with the continuous household budget survey so we can get a richer data base, 
Develop a food quality index to be included in the analysis and Compare results from 
the NHS and the Catalan Health Survey which include estimated instead of reported 
weights and heights.
