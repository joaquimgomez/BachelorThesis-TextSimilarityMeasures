Abstract. The most of Spanish olive farms are concentrated in Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) with the majority of 
producer areas are under Objective 1 of the EU Regional Policy. The EU has long recognized such distinctive 
characteristics of those holdings with a specific support measures aiming to prevent the abandonment of olive groves 
as well as to support sustainable development of this sector. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact 
of LFA payment on the olive farms technical efficiency. Two sample farms located in LFA (63 farms receiving LFA 
payment support and 99 farms do not) have been observed from 2000 to 2004. A stochastic frontier production and 
Random-effect Tobit models have been used. Results indicate that LFA payment, age of manager, workforce 
composition and farm size affect efficiency levels. The LFA payment coefficient indicates a significant negative 
impact on the technical efficiency of Spanish olive farms. Farms that not receive LFA payment has a technical 
efficiency rate 0.15 percentage units upper compared to those that receive this payment.  

Keywords: LFA payment, olive, technical efficiency, stochastic frontier, Random-effect Tobit. 

1. Introduction 

 

The Spanish olive sector has a distinguished presence in worldwide agriculture sector. Such situation is 
manifested by the importance of its production and exportation, being the leading country with 38.9% and 
40% respectively (IOC, 2009). Moreover, this sector covers 2,483,697 hectares with 308 million trees, 
representing more than 25% of the world's growing area (MARM, 2009). 

This sector is mainly made up by a large number of small farms size whose productions is characterized 
by vulnerability to annual variation, low profitably, and heterogeneity, both in space and time. Most of 
those holdings are concentrated in Less Favoured Areas (hereafter, LFA), and are considered under 
Community Regional Policy Objective 1 with a few exceptions. Beside its production function, in these 
areas the olive sector represents an important source of employment and a solid column of the social and 
economic development. It provides a full-time as well as seasonal employment -olive picking in 
particular- which supplement farm workers’ income since demand for farm labour is concentrated in the 
rest of year. Moreover, olive farms play a role in the protection of the vulnerable area from desertification 
and loss of biodiversity. The olive cultivation is considered as an instrument tool in addressing 
environmental problems given it high undemanding, efficient water resource use and well-adaptability to 
Mediterranean region conditions. Its positive impact on the environment makes it’s an important tool to 
combat desertification in these region. 

The European Union (EU) has long recognized such special characteristics of the LFA. They has 
identified two main LFA types: a) mountain areas (in Spain, areas with a minimum altitude of 1000m or a 
slope greater than 20% or a minimum altitude of 600m plus a slope of at least 15%) and b) other LFA 
characterized by poor productivity, specific handicaps, low population, etc. It is worth to mention that 
58% of the total Utilized Agriculture Area (UAA) in the EU is classified as LFA, while in Spain, 81.8% 
of UAA is located in LFA, in which 33.7% is LFA-Mountain and 48.1% in LFA-others.

The EU under the rural development program applied during 2000-20061 (Regulation No 1257/1999) has 
provided the LFA farms with a specific support measures as compensatory payment granted per hectare 
of agricultural area. These measures aim to avoid the abandonment of olive groves in marginal areas, to 
maintain a viable rural community, to promote sustainable farming systems which in particular take 
account of environmental protection requirements and to support a sustainable development through the 
promotion of healthy and quality products.  

Previous literature has demonstrated that policy support could have impact on different farms’ aspects. In 
this line, some papers have analyzed their impact on production decision (Moro and Sckokai, 1999; Oude 
Lansink and Peerlings, 1996), investment decision (Oude Lansink et al., 2001; Carey and Zilberman, 
2002 and Wabi et al., 2006) and technical efficiency (Bezlepkina et al., 2005, Kleinhanß et al., 2007, and 
Lambarraa et al., 2009). However, up to date, there are no published studies that have analyzed the 
impact of LFA payment on farm’s technical efficiency, especially in Spain.  

The main objective of this study is to analyze the determinants factor of farms technical efficiency as well 
as the impact of LFA payment on such efficiency. To achieve this objective, we assess a technical 
efficiency of two different samples farms located in LFA and differentiate by receiving or not a support 
payment using a stochastic frontier (SF) model. In the follow-up a Random-effect Tobit regression is 
carried out for all sample data using estimated technical efficiency ratio. This analysis allows the 
exploration of the relationship between technical efficiency and other specific variables for all samples as 
a whole with a special attention for payment factors. This step allows also to check results consistency SF 
model and to compare both results. The analysis focuses on farm-level data observed from 2000 to 2004, 
based on the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section gives a review of the SF 
methodology and Tobit estimation. This is followed by an empirical application. In Section 4 the results 
are discussed. Finally, some conclusions are outlined. 

2. Methodology  
To analyze the impact of LFA payment on technical efficiency, first a stochastic frontier methodology has 
been used. This technique implies a specification of two error components. The technical inefficiency 
error term that measures the extent to which actual production falls short of maximum attainable output, 
and is augmented by a two-sided error component (v) representing other factors that might generate 

irrelevant noise in the data (such as measurement error and unobserved inputs). itv  is assumed to be iid 
2(0, )vN  , and itu  is a vector of independently distributed and nonnegative random disturbances. 

We use maximum likelihood techniques to estimate the stochastic production frontier model. This model 
can be expressed as follows:  

 

-( , ; ) it itv uit ity f x t e   [1] 
where ity  is the output of the i-th firm ( 1,...,i N ) in period 1,...,t T , ( , ; )itf x t   represents the 
production technology, itx  is a (1 )K  vector of inputs and other factors influencing production 
associated with the i -th firm in period t ,   is a ( 1)K   vector of unknown parameters to be 
estimated. 

The technical efficiency of a producer at a certain point in time can be expressed as the ratio of actual 
output to the maximum potential output:

Following Battese and Coelli (1995), technical inefficiency is assumed to respond to the following pattern 

of behaviour: ( )
it it it

u g z   , where itz  is a ( 1)M   vector of that includes the determinants of a 
farm’s technical inefficiency,   is a (1 )M  vector of unknown coefficients, and it ~ ),0(

2
N  is a 

random variable defined by the truncation of the normal distribution such that the truncation point is -

itz . 

The Tobit model is used to explore the relation between technical efficiency scores and farms specific 
factors. The SF approach provides efficiency measure with a distribution bounded between 1 and 0. Since 
the efficiency scores are double censored, the ordinary least squares methods cannot be applied because it 
will give a biased estimation. Thus, a Tobit model as a limited dependent variable approach is applied. 

The Tobit model can be specified as (Kmenta, 1990; and Wooldridge, 2002): 

 
T T

it i tE T F P      [3] 

Where i tE T is a latent variable that refers to the technical efficiency of LFA olive farm i en period t, 

and F  is a vector of farm specific variable, P is a vector of external factor representing payment and 
time in this case, and is likely to affect the technical efficiency. However, due to nature of the technical 
efficiency measure, we have:

To explore the effect of farm characteristics and external factor on the technical efficiency score, ta 
random-effect Tobit models is used. The objective of the use of the random-effect Tobit model is to 
exploit the nature of panel data, capturing individual specific-effects and assuming no correlation between 
the individual specific effects and explanatory variables. 

The random-effect Tobit model for technical efficiency measure can be expressed as:

i tE T is censored at 0 and 1, the random-effects i  are iid

2( 0 , )N  independently of i . 

3. Empirical application 
As mentioned for empirical application we have used the FADN data for the period 2000-2004. The 
FADN Data set was launched in 1965 with the objective to monitor the income and business activities of 
agricultural holdings and to evaluate the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy measures. It is a 
European system of sample surveys that take place each year and collect information from each farm 
includes physical, structural, economic and financial data. This data set provides representative data of 
EU agricultural holdings along three dimensions: region, economic size and type of farming. This dataset 
classifies farms into different typologies that allow identifying the main types of farming. In this study, 
we used the olive farms located in LFA other than mountains, given that the majority of the data available 
is located in this area. Moreover, This LFA type is more representatives in the Spanish case representing 
60% of Spanish LFA area. Aggregates data on annual input and output price indices are taken from 



4 

Eurostat. A two unbalanced panel data sample of Spanish olive farms are used. A total of 162 olive farms 
are observed from 2000 to 2004, which 99 farms of the sample receive the LFA payment support.  

Following previous studies (e.g Karagiannis and Tzouvelekas, 2001), the production frontier function in 
[1] is specified as a Translog function that takes the form:

Where 1i , ,N   indexes the farms in the sample, 1t , ,T   indicates the time period, 
1k , j , ,K  indicate the conventional inputs used in the production process, β is the vector of 

parameters to be estimated, and, as noted, eit=vit-uit is a stochastic composite error term.  

Production, ity , is defined as an implicit quantity index by dividing total olive sales in currency units by 
the olive price index. Vector itx  is defined as a (1 15)  vector that contains five inputs. The first input, 

1x , includes labour input and is measured in labour hours per year, 2x  comprises pesticides, 3x  
represents fertilizers, 4x  symbolizes the hectares occupied by olive groves, and 5x  comprises variable 
crop-specific inputs other than fertilizers and pesticides. Input use variables 2x , 3x  and 5x  are 
expressed as implicit quantity indices by dividing the consumption of these inputs in currency units by 
their respective price indices.  

Given that the Battese and Coelli (1995) model does not really exploit the nature of panel data, an 
alternative method are used to overcome such a limitation. A restricted version of the fixed effects 
technique is used by incorporating regional dummies into the production technology function (Álvarez 
and Orea, 2004 and Lambarraa et al., 2007). The use of regional dummies assumes that farms are 
heterogeneous across regions, while homogeneity is assumed within regions only for unobserved 
variables. Specifically, we used 5 dummy variables to identify the different Spanish regions.  

The technical inefficiency effects function is specified as a linear function

with M =7 . The components of itz  include a constant  1z , a workforce composition  2z which is 
computed as the ratio of family labour hours to total labour hours, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the 

holding is renting agricultural land and zero otherwise  3z , the age of the holding’s primary decision 
maker  4z , time  5z , farm size  6z expressed in European Size Unit (ESU), and payment ratio 
 7z which is computed as the ratio of LFA subsidies about total subsides. Maximum- likelihood 
methods are applied in model estimation. 

Rental land is expected to increase farm’s efficiency (Lambarraa et al., 2007). Direct costs of land rentals 
may create stronger incentives to work the land in a more efficient manner, relative to the opportunity 
costs borne by owned land. A farmer’s age is also likely to influence technical efficiency. Younger 
farmers should be expected to be more prone to introduce changes in farm management techniques that 
increase efficiency, relative to elderly ones (Battese and Coelli, 1995). The variable time is also expected 
to influence technical efficiency. Since farm managers are likely to learn from their errors, the passage of 
time should be expected to improve technical efficiency (Battese and Coelli, 1995). To the extent that 
family labour is more relevant in small, less competitive farms, it may be associated to a higher level of 
inefficiency (Lambarraa et al., 2007 and 2009). Family size is expected to increase farms technical 
efficiency (e.g. Gianakas et al., 2003; Alvarez and Arias, 2004 and Tsionas, 2006). While, subsidies are 
expected to have negative impact about technical efficiency (e.g. Bezlepkina et al., 2005, Kleinhanß et 
al., 2007, and Lambarraa et al., 2009). Results derived from the estimation of the model are presented in 
the following section.

For Random-effect Tobit model, we used the same variables above mentioned as well as the altitude level 
variable assumed to be zero for altitude less than 300m and 1 otherwise. It is expected that the altitude 
level affect negatively the technical efficiency. To mention that in this specification model, the payment 
variables is introduced as a dummy variable equal to 1 value for farms receiving LFA payment and o 
otherwise. The technical efficiency scores are assumed censored at 0 and 0.9 (the maximum value).  

4. Results 
Summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis are given in Table 1. This table shows that 
sample farms' average annual output totals around 26,379.38 €. Table 1 also indicates that sample farms 
employ 3,022 labour hours per year, 79% of which are family labour. They spent by year 1,424 € for 
fertilizers, 1,448 for pesticides and 3,829 as other crop specific cost by. Sample farms have, on average, 
25.13 ha of land, of which 8% is rented. The farms size expressed in European Size Unit (ESU) is about 
34.8. The average farmer's age in the sample is 57 years.  

Results derived from simultaneously estimating the Translog production frontier and the technical 
inefficiency equation are presented in Table 2. The variance parameter, γ, is statistically significant which 
suggests the relevance of technical inefficiency in explaining output variability among Spanish LFA area 
olive farms. Estimated   coefficients provide an explanation of the determinants of sample farms’ 
technical inefficiency. As expected, the coefficient representing a farmer’s age is positive and statistically 
significant for both models which suggests that young farmers are more efficient in comparison to older 
ones. Thus, younger farmers may be more likely to introduce efficiency-improving changes in their 
holdings relative to aged ones. Farms renting land are shown to be more efficient relative to farms owning 
cultivated land. This provides evidence that land rental costs motivate more efficient operations relative to 
the opportunity costs of owned land.  

The workforce composition shows that farms with a higher proportion of family labour and not receiving 
payment are more efficient relative to the farms with a higher proportion of remunerated work. The 
negative coefficient for the variable time in the case of the model representing farms not receiving 
payment suggests that the technical efficiency of those farms tended to increase throughout the period 
studied. This result suggests that farm managers not receiving subsidies learn from their errors and 
experience, and has an optimal allocation of managerial effort. For the farms located in LFA but receiving 
payment, the results shows that technical inefficiency of those farms has been decreasing over time. This 
provides evidence that farmers receiving payment does not improve their efficiency levels with the 
passage of time.  

The impact of subsidies on technical efficiency is analyzed through the payment ratio coefficient. The 
results show a significant negative impact of subsidies on the technical efficiency of LFA Spanish olive 
farms. Specifically, LFA payment seems to have had a relevant negative effect on the technical efficiency 
level of Spanish olive farms. This result is compatible with reduced motivation to produce efficiently as a 
response of farmer’s decision to trade off market income for subsidy income. Other studies that analyze 
the impact of subsidies on technical efficiency of farms located in conventional area find similar results 
(e.g. Lambarraa et al., 2009; Bezlepkina et al., 2005; Guyomard et al., 2006; Kleinhanß et al., 2007 and 
Emvalomatis et al., 2008).  

The negative impact of LFA payment on farms technical efficiency is explained by the fact that subsidies 
guaranteed a large part of farmer’s income in LFA which decrease TE. This decrease is caused by a non-
optimal allocation of managerial effort which is manifested by sign difference of time coefficient for both 
models. Thus, farmers not receiving LFA payment improve their TE through time, while farms receiving 
LFA payment doesn’t. 

Results on technical efficiency distribution by year and interval in both cases are presented in Table 3. As 
we can see, the evolution of TE by year shows an upper TE average level for farms not receiving payment 
along years. The difference of TE average level between both farms (receiving and not) fluctuate from a 
minimum of 8 points to a maximum of 22 points registered in 2003, in all case a higher level of technical 
efficiency is registered at level of farms that doesn’t receive payment. Moreover, such distribution shows 
that 68% of farms that do not receive payments are concentrated in high TE interval level (>60 %), while 
just 40% of farms that receive payment are present in these interval. Estimated average efficiency levels 
for sample farms receiving payment are about 52.6% while for those not receiving payment are 66.2%.

Table 4 reports the estimation of Random-effect Tobit model. All the coefficients are statistically 
significant except land rental variable. Comparing the results with SF model, we find that the sign of age 
variable is similar showing results consistency. The work force composition is found to have a negative 
relationship with technical efficiency score which is consistent with the SF results for farms not receiving 
payments. Farms size variable is found to have a positive relationship with TE scores. Furthermore, the 
negative sign of altitude coefficient shows that technical efficiency decreases with altitude level. Thus, 
technical efficiency increases with farm size, while farms managed by aged farmers and having lower 
proportion of remunerated work, and having high altitude tend to be inefficient. The LFA payment and 
technical efficiency score has a negative relationship confirming SF results, and showing that the LFA 
payment has a negative impact on technical efficiency of olive farms.  

5. Conclusion 
Spanish LFA presents more than 80% of total utilized agriculture area. The olive sector is one of the main 
farming activities mostly located in these areas. Given the relevance of this sector in the Spanish 
agriculture and the prominent position of Spanish production and exportation worldwide, the relative 
technical efficiency has been analyzed of Spanish olive farms located in LFA. Specifically, this paper 
assesses the impacts of LFA compensatory payment on technical efficiency of Spanish olive farms. A 
stochastic frontier model was estimated using a two unbalanced panel data of 162 olive farms observed 
from 2000 to 2004, which 99 farms receive the LFA payment support. Follow up by a Tobit model that 
analyzes the relationship between technical efficiency scores and other variables for sample as whole. 

Estimated average efficiency levels for sample farms are about 52.6% for farms receiving payment and 
66.2% for farms do not. Parameters of technical inefficiency equation suggest that several variables affect 
efficiency levels, but do not have the same impact in both cases. Technical efficiency scores seem to be 
positively correlated with farms’ size, age of manager, while, the farm rents cultivated land decrease it. 
On the other hand, workforce composition shows that farms with a higher proportion of family labour and 
not receiving payment are more efficient relative to the farms with a higher proportion of remunerated 
work.  

Result also suggests that farm managers which not receive compensatory allowance learn from their 
errors and experience, and has an optimal allocation of managerial effort. Such results are supported by 
the negative sign of payment ratio coefficient, which provides a negative direct impact of LFA aid 
scheme on technical efficiency of LFA olive farms. Results also shows for all sample as whole that 
technical efficiency increase with farm size, and decrease in the case of farms managed by aged farmers, 
having lower proportion of remunerated work, and having high altitude. The LFA payment and technical 
efficiency score has a negative relationship which confirm the results of the first analysis, and shows that 
the LFA payment has a negative impact about technical efficiency of olive farms.  

Finally, the LFA aid scheme applied during the 2000-2004 has had a negative impact on technical 
efficiency of olive farms located in these areas. Future regulation in LFA support scheme need to take 
into consideration this fact by designing an adequate compensation scheme that help farms to improve 
their technical efficiency and to survive in these marginal areas.
