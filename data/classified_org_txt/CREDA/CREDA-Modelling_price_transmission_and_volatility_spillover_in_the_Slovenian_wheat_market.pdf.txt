Running title: Price transmission and volatility spillover

Abstract
Interdependence between first and second moments of producer and consumer wheat prices in Slovenia is assessed, in light of the recent major historical events that the country has undergone, as well as the recent rumors of cartel agreements between millers causing a decline in farm-gate prices, while leaving consumer prices untouched. A threshold vector error correction and multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model with exogenous variables is applied. Results indicate that price-level adjustments mainly favor retailers by increasing their marketing margins. Important second-moment interactions are also identified. Increases in international wheat stocks reduce producer prices, while higher interest rates increase their instability.

1. Introduction
The recent history of Slovenia involves a succession of major events, including the secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, the transition from communism to capitalism, the adhesion to the European Union in 2004, as well as the adoption of the euro in 2007. All these changes have had profound economic consequences and have involved a progressive opening of the Slovenian economy that is currently more responsive to shocks to international markets. Gabrijelčič, et al. (2012) have recently suggested Slovenia food price pass-through along the food marketing chain having changed as a result of the global changes in agricultural markets. 
	Over the last decade, significant changes in world agricultural commodity prices have been observed. Important increases were registered from the beginning of 2006, reaching record levels by mid 2008. Prices dramatically declined during the second half of 2008, partially recovered after the second half of 2009, peaking again in 2011. These changes in global food prices have been accompanied by increased food price volatility (Sumner, 2009; Rapsomanikis, 2011; Serra, 2011). The outbreak of the global biofuel market, weather conditions, or increased speculation in agricultural commodity futures markets, have been identified as driving factors of recent price behavior. Interest in studying commodity prices has thus been renewed. While a number of empirical studies have analyzed price-level linkages and patterns of price transmission along the food marketing chain (Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Meyer and Von Cramon-Taubadel, 2004; Bojnec and Peter, 2005; Reziti and Panagopoulos, 2008), vertical food price volatility spillovers have received much less research interest. Price transmission and volatility spillovers along the food marketing chain are however two complementary concepts. Price transmission studies focus on the predictable component of prices. Through the use of conditional mean models, they assess how prices are transmitted along the food marketing chain. Price volatility spillover studies, in contrast, focus on the second moment of the unpredictable component of prices. Using a conditional volatility model, they describe volatility interactions between different levels of the marketing chain (Assefa et al., 2013).	
	Buguk et al. (2003) study price volatility spillovers along the US catfish supply chain using an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model. They find strong evidence of unidirectional volatility flows down the supply chain. The analysis by Apergis and Rezitis (2003) examines volatility spillover effects across agricultural input, output and retail food prices in Greece. They utilize a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) specification to obtain estimates of the unpredictable component of prices, i.e., the error terms. These are subsequently modeled through a multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) process. Authors find evidence of second-moment interactions among the markets considered. Rezitis and Stavropoulos (2011) assess nonlinearities in the conditional mean model, as well as price volatility interactions among producer and consumer broiler markets in Greece. A threshold VECM (TVECM) and MGARCH models are estimated sequentially for such purpose. Evidence of both producer and consumer price-level adjustments to long-run disequilibriums is found. MGARCH results provide significant evidence of volatility persistence in producer and consumer markets. Serra (2011) investigates the impacts of the BSE crisis on the transmission of price instability along the Spanish beef marketing chain by means of a Smooth Transition Conditional Correlation (STCC)-GARCH model. She finds evidence of different price volatility behavior under different market conditions.
	The review of the literature shows that analyses assessing price volatility along the food marketing chain are very scarce and that have rarely allowed for nonlinearities in price behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the well established literature focusing on first-moment price dependencies along food markets, that has provided ample evidence of the need to allow for nonlinearities in price patterns (Meyer and von Cramon-Taubadel, 2004; Frey and Manera, 2007). Failure to correctly capture price-level behavior may lead to failure to soundly assess the second moment of the price distribution. The geographic focus of the studies reviewed allows to identify further gaps, with Slovenia receiving scarce attention in the literature. Based upon the preceding, in this article, a nonlinear TVECM and MGARCH model are jointly estimated to study price dependencies between producer and consumer markets for wheat in Slovenia.
	Examining price transmission and volatility spillovers in the Slovenian wheat marketing chain is considered economically and food policy relevant for several reasons. First, wheat is the second most important field crop in Slovenia in terms of harvested areas and value of production and the most important in sales (Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia - SORS, 2013). Second, the wheat food marketing chain is an important part of the Slovenian food supply chain and it is relevant to food security. The chain involves several participants including seed producers, farmers, traders, millers, animal feed producers, or food processors. Questions such as whether changes in producer prices are transmitted to consumer prices and/or whether the response of consumer prices to producer price increases is faster than their response to producer price declines, are important issues to be studied. Price transmission and volatility spillovers are important determinants of profit distribution among chain participants. The pass-through of wheat prices along the Slovenian food marketing chain has recently captured the attention of popular press, consumers, and the government, as millers have been accused of cartel agreements that have depressed farm-gate prices, leaving consumer prices untouched (Marot, 2016). It is thus interesting to study how prices in this sector behave, and particularly to identify any possible characteristics that could harm its competitiveness. We do so by using time-series econometric techniques.	
	Prices at a certain level of the food marketing chain are likely to depend not only on prices at other market levels, but also on other possible exogenous variables such as macroeconomic conditions or stock levels (Wright, 2011; Serra and Gil, 2012). The economic theory of storage indicates that commodity prices should depend on the level of stocks. Many empirical analyses have considered stocks to study commodity price dynamics and have found evidence of a strong relationship between stocks and price behaviour (Shively, 1996; Kim and Chavas, 2002; Balcombe, 2011; Stigler and Prakash, 2011). Interest rates have been also found to be relevant to explain food price dynamics by Kim and Chavas (2002), Frankel (2006) and Serra and Gil (2012). Other macroeconomic indicators including exchange rates have been also considered to study price fluctuations (Headey and Fan, 2008; Baffes and Haniotis, 2010; Bakucs et al., 2012). In the case of Slovenia, exchange rates may not be relevant due to the importance of intra-European Union (EU) trade of food products. According to SORS (2013), the share of EU member states in Slovenia wheat imports reached 95.9% in 2011. While Slovenia mainly trades with Europe, European prices are connected to international prices through trade (Bakucs et al., 2015). As a result, our analysis allows for the influence of international wheat stocks-to-use ratio. Slovenian interest rates are also considered in our study, as an indicator of macroeconomic conditions.[footnoteRef:3] To our knowledge, this is the first analysis on price transmission along the food marketing chain to allow for the influence of exogenous variables to explain both price levels and their volatility, which represents another contribution of our paper to the existing research.  [3:  Other exogenous variables were considered, but not found to be statistically significant.] 

	The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the wheat sector in Slovenia. After describing both threshold and MGARCH techniques in section 3, in section 4 we present the results of the empirical application. Finally, the paper ends with the concluding remarks section.

2. Wheat sector in Slovenia
Wheat is the second most important field crop in Slovenia after maize. Further, wheat is the most important field crop when it comes to direct sales from farmers. The area harvested, yields and wheat production have changed over time (SORS, 2012a) with harvested areas tending to decline, yields tending to increase, and wheat production to remain stable. The number of farms in wheat production declined between the two agricultural censuses from 30.9 thousand in 2000 to 18.5 thousand in 2010.[footnoteRef:4] While wheat production declined from 162.6 to 153.5 thousand tons and the wheat area declined from 38.2 to 31.7 thousand ha, the area per farm increased from 1.24 to 1.71 ha. This suggests an increase in average wheat farm size and increased concentration of wheat production in fewer hands. Wheat production in Slovenia mainly comes from small and medium-sized family farms and a few large commercial farms.  Most wheat is produced in the Eastern part of Slovenia. The country is a net wheat importer. Between 2000 and 2010 wheat imports increased from 119.3 thousand tons to 175.9 thousand tons. In 2011, 225.6 thousand tons of wheat were imported, representing an increase of 28.2% with respect to 2010. Variations in wheat imports are associated to variations in domestic production and consumption. Since the Slovenian adhesion to the Euro zone in 2004, almost all wheat is imported from the EU countries. [4:  Unless otherwise indicated, the information presented in this section was obtained from SORS (2013).] 

Agricultural producers are bearing a substantial fraction of the risks in the wheat supply chain, including price changes. Wheat plays a crucial role in the economic performance of field crop farms, particularly those located in the remote, less developed Eastern part of Slovenia. Assessing wheat price patterns in Slovenia is important given the relevance of wheat price for agricultural producer revenues, for wheat flour-bread costs, as well as for livestock feed prices (in association with maize prices). As noted above, the pass-through of wheat prices along the food marketing chain has recently captured the attention of popular press, consumers, and the government, as millers have been accused of cartel agreements that have depressed farm-gate prices, leaving consumer prices untouched (Marot, 2016). While the Ombudsman has provided support for these arguments, the Chamber of Food and Agricultural companies has denied such accusations.
With an average wheat consumption per capita on the order of 70 kg per year, human consumption (e.g. flour, bread and similar bakery products) is the most relevant wheat demand source. In 2010, 12.6% of annual average household expenditures were allocated to food, with bread and cereal expenses representing on the order of 2.4%, i.e., around 20% of total household expenditures on food. As a result, the wheat price has also a relevant influence on food expenditures and food consumption, particularly for those consumers with lower incomes. In short, wheat market developments in Slovenia play an important role in the sustainable development of field crop farming, food safety for vulnerable social groups, and regional development of remote and less developed areas.  
   
3. Methods
To assess price transmission and volatility spillovers within the Slovenian wheat market chain, we rely on a bivariate TVECM-MGARCH specification. Price-level transmission along the chain is studied through the TVECM, the conditional mean model that focuses on the predictable component of prices. Volatility spillovers are assessed with the MGARCH, the conditional covariance model that studies the second moment of the unpredictable component of the price series. Misspecifications in the conditional mean model will translate into biased second-moment estimates. 
As mentioned, previous literature has provided ample evidence of non-linear price level transmission among related markets. The conditional mean model is thus specified as a TVECM that allows for price behavior to change depending on market conditions. The TVECM is considered as one of the most popular non-linear models in the literature (Hassouneh et al., 2015; Ghassan and Banerjee, 2014). The economic theory of storage indicates that prices should depend on the level of stocks. The influence of world wheat inventories on the first moment of prices is thus considered, by incorporating world wheat stocks-to-use ratio in the mean price equations.[footnoteRef:5] Since Slovenia is considered as a net importer of wheat, we expect that an increase in the international wheat stocks-to-use ratio will cause the Slovenian market price to decline. A one-threshold, two-regime bivariate TVECM can be expressed as follows:  [5:  Other explanatory variables, including interest rate, were also considered, but not found to be statistically significant.] 




















where g =1,2 is the index that denotes the price regime;  and .  and  are the producer and consumer prices being analysed, respectively, t indexes time, j denotes the number of lags and  is the stocks-to-use ratio variable.  and  are parameters that capture short-run dynamic price responses,  and  measure the short-run impacts of the exogenous variable on price behaviour, and  and  are the adjustment parameters that measure the response of prices to deviations from the long-run equilibrium. Variable  is the lagged error correction term derived from the cointegration relationship.  and  are the residuals of the conditional mean model (i.e., the unpredictable component of prices) and  is the threshold that delineates the different regimes. Following previous research,  is used as the variable that triggers threshold behaviour. 

	In order to estimate the threshold parameter, , a grid search is conducted. The threshold is searched over the values of the threshold variable and the search is restricted to ensure an adequate number of observations in each regime. The grid search minimizes the log determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals of the TVECMs, which is analogous to maximizing a likelihood function. To test for the significance of the differences in parameters across the different regimes in the TVECM, the sup-LR statistic developed by Hansen and Seo (2002) is used. This test compares the fit of a linear VECM with the fit of the TVECM. The sup-LR statistic has a non-standard distribution because the threshold parameters are not identified under the null hypothesis. Hence, to calculate the p-value of the sup-LR statistic, bootstrapping techniques developed by Hansen and Seo (2002) are used. In our empirical model, a total of 1,000 simulations are run.
To examine volatility spillovers among producer and consumer markets, a bivariate Baba–Engle–Kraft–Kroner (BEKK) model is chosen to represent the conditional covariance model (Engle and Kroner, 1995):  

                                                                                                (2)










where  is a 2 × 2 conditional variance-covariance matrix. Matrix  (2 × 2) depicts the effects of lagged shocks on current price volatility, () represents the influence of past volatility on current conditional variances, and C is a 2 × 2 lower triangular matrix. The influence of exogenous variables on price volatility can be allowed for through matrix  in (2) (Moschini and Myers, 2002; Serra and Gil; 2012). In our paper , where , being  the interest rate considered as an exogenous variable influencing price volatility, and  a parameter vector.[footnoteRef:6]  [6: As noted above, Kim and Chavas (2002); Frankel (2006) and Serra and Gil (2012) have stressed the relevance of the influence of interest rates on price volatility. The influence of other regressors such as stocks-to-use ratio was also considered. Results were not statistically significant.

A complete representation of a bivariate BEKK-GARCH model can be expressed as follows:

As is well known, parameters in (3) cannot be directly interpreted. Instead, the nonlinear parameter functions in the conditional variance and covariance equations need to be derived and interpreted. The conditional variance equation for each price can be derived as follows:

The conditional mean and covariance models are jointly estimated using standard maximum likelihood procedures. Prior to the estimation of joint models, the time-series properties of price data are evaluated. Specifically, standard unit root tests are applied in order to determine whether price series are stationary or not. To test for the existence of a long-run cointegration relationship and determine the error correction term, the Johansen (1988) test is performed. The threshold parameter is also estimated in the preliminary stage using the grid search technique described above.  
To better understand our data, the Volatility Impulse Response Function (VIRF) approach developed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006) is applied. VIRF provides an effective way to study the impact of external shocks on wheat market volatilities. The VIRF can be defined as follows:

4. Empirical application
Price transmission and volatility spillovers along the Slovenian wheat marketing chain are studied by means of a TVECM-MGARCH. Our empirical analysis uses two series of monthly Slovenian producer and consumer wheat prices as well as world wheat stocks-to-use ratio and Slovenian interest rate. Marketing chain prices are obtained from the SI-STAT, Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS, 2012b) and are expressed in euros per kilogram.[footnoteRef:7] Producer prices for soft wheat are collected by SORS by means of a written questionnaire distributed to firms, cooperatives and other organizations that sell their own agricultural produce or purchase directly from farmers for further sale or processing. Producer prices, expressed on a per kg of wheat, do not include value-added tax and subsidies received by farms. Consumer prices for wheat flour type-500 are collected by statistical observers in four towns in Slovenia: Ljubljana, the capital city, and three other big cities: Koper, Maribor and Novo Mesto. The four cities are considered to be representative of retail prices in Slovenia as a whole. Consumer prices are obtained from selected shops and markets in each town. The consumer price represents the price paid by the consumer and includes taxes. The average consumer price in a town corresponds to a simple arithmetic mean of collected prices in that town. The average country price is built based on a weighted mean of average town prices, with population in each town serving as a weighting factor. The world wheat stocks-to-use ratio published by the USDA (2012) is also used in this analysis and the information on the short-run interest rate is obtained from the Bank of Slovenia.[footnoteRef:8] All series are observed from January 2000 to December 2011, providing a total of 144 observations. Time series used in this study are displayed in Figure 1. Wheat prices have undergone important increases since 2007, which has in turn led to relevant price fluctuations, especially at the producer level. After having registered a declining trend from 2003 to 2007, and reaching minimum levels by the end of 2007, the world wheat stocks-to-use ratio has experienced important increases.  [7:  For the period prior to the introduction of the euro, prices were converted from Slovenian tolars to euros using the irrevocable exchange rate (1 euro = 239.64 Slovenian tolars).]  [8:  Interest rate was made available to the authors upon request. After the Slovenia adhesion to the Euro zone with the euro adoption on January 1, 2007, the interest rate published by the European Central Bank (ECB, 2013) is used.] 

The empirical analysis is based on a logarithmic transformation of time series data.  Standard Dickey and Fuller (1979) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski et al., 1992) tests confirm the presence of a single unit root in each price series (see Table 1). Once confirmed that price series are integrated of order one I(1), the standard Johansen (1988) test is applied to determine whether a long-run relationship exists between prices. The results from Johansen (1988) cointegration test (Table 2) indicate that producer and consumer prices are cointegrated. The Hansen and Seo (2002) sup-LR test statistic (see Table 3) allows rejecting linearity against a TVECM that allows for different price patterns, depending on the magnitude and sign of the error correction term. Specifically, two price behavior regimes can be found in the Slovenian wheat sector. One (regime I) mainly corresponding to negative and very small positive error correction term values (ECT<=0.134), and a second regime corresponding to ECT>0.134.[footnoteRef:9]  [9:  Three-regime TVECM was also tested against a VECM. Results indicate no significant differences between both models.] 





Results of the TVECM-MGARCH estimation are presented in Table 4. We first focus on interpretation of the conditional mean model. Parameter estimates provide evidence that both producer and consumer prices only adjust to deviations from the long-run equilibrium relationship in the second regime. Positive values of the error correction term characterizing the second regime (ECT>0.134), are registered when the producer (consumer) price is too expensive (cheap), requiring a decline (increase) to maintain market equilibrium.  Error correction in this regime is represented by   and   and implies a decrease in producer prices and an increase in consumer prices to re-equilibrate the system, which involves increasing retail marketing margins. Conversely, when the ECT is negative, or takes very small positive values, producer and consumer prices do not react to deviations from the long-run equilibrium (  and  are not statistically significant). Thus, while the price received by agricultural producers does not increase when it is too cheap, it is instead reduced when it is too expensive. Conversely, retailers tend to increase prices when the retail price is too cheap relative to the producer price, but are less prone to reduce prices when these are too high relative to producer prices. This may suggest that retailers use their market power to increase marketing margins. Parameters also indicate that the degree of producer price response to long-run disequilibrium is higher than the consumer price adjustment. These results are expected and are in line with previous literature that suggests that upstream prices generally do all the adjustment compared to consumer prices that are more sticky and slowly-responsive to market shocks (Goodwin and Holt, 1999; Peltman, 2000; Serra and Goodwin, 2003; Ben Kaabia and Gil, 2007; Hassouneh et al., 2012).
Stocks-to-use ratio parameters suggest that producer prices decrease as a response to an increase in the international wheat stock levels and this adjustment only occurs in the second regime (where producer prices are too expensive). The negative relationship between stocks and producer prices can be perceived in Figure 1 that shows that producer prices reached their highest levels when the lowest level of world stocks-to-use ratio was observed. Stock building is specially relevant during low price periods, when economic agents prefer to postpone sales into the future. Results are expected and are compatible with previous literature that has found that when stock levels decline, prices become more sensitive to shocks (Wright, 2011; Balcombe, 2011; Serra and Gil, 2012). In contrast to producer prices, consumer prices do not react to stock changes. Table 4 also shows short-run price dynamics. While error correction dynamics seem to benefit retail margins, cross-regressive short-run dynamics suggest the opposite as cross-price effects are negative in the consumer price equation (under both regimes), while being positive in the producer price equation (in the first regime). In other words, while past increases of the producer price cause a decline in the current consumer price, past increases on the consumer price cause an increase in current producer prices. Own price effects are only significant when prices are low (regime 1 for producer price and regime 2 for consumer price). They are negative, which suggests that own-price effects tend to further decrease price levels, moving them further from the equilibrium. 







In the following lines, we focus on discussing the conditional variance model results. In order to check for residual autocorrelations, Hosking's multivariate test statistic (Hosking, 1981) is applied. Results suggest that the model is correctly specified. As previously mentioned, the individual coefficients in the BEKK-MGARCH parameterization cannot be interpreted in a straightforward manner. Inferences can be however drawn from the nonlinear parameter functions in the conditional variance equations presented in Table 5. Results indicate that producer price volatility  is positively affected by its own lagged volatility  and by past volatility in consumer prices . In other words, higher levels of volatility in the past bring higher current instability in producer prices. Parameters also suggest that the influence of interest rate on the conditional producer price volatility is positive and statistically significant. Hence, more expensive credit markets imply higher fluctuations in prices received by agricultural producers. Results are consistent within the Slovenian context where milling enterprises are the major wheat buyers and holders of wheat storage. They largely finance wheat stocks through loans obtained from banks. The increase in interest rates causes higher storage costs, which in turn can lead to reduced stock levels and increased fluctuations in wheat producer prices. In contrast to producer price instability, consumer price volatility () is mainly affected by past market shocks in either producer and consumer markets (,  and  are all statistically significant). Hence, volatility spillovers flow in both directions, from consumer to producer and vice-versa. The mechanisms through which these instabilities are transmitted however differ: while past volatility in the consumer market induces current volatility in producer prices, they are past producer market shocks that cause instability in consumer prices.
According to Hafner and Herwartz (2006), VIRF, measuring a shock hitting the entire price system, depends on the history of the series. In this application, we simulate the impacts of a shock assumed to occur on September 2007, just before the financial crisis. VIRFs suggest that producer price volatility increases during the first two months after the shock and decreases thereafter, returning to pre-shock levels after about 9 months (see Figure 2). A system shock is also seen to affect consumer price volatility. This volatility shock tends to disappear after about 8 months (see Figure 3). It is important to note that producer price volatility seems to be more affected by price system shocks than consumer price volatility, yielding bigger responses in magnitude. These findings are expected, as retail prices are usually less volatile than producer prices. 

5. Concluding remarks
The recent history of Slovenia involves a succession of major events that have had profound economic consequences and have involved a progressive opening of the Slovenian economy. Gabrijelčič, et al. (2012) have recently suggested Slovenia food price pass through along the food marketing chain having changed as a result of the global changes in agricultural markets. The objective of this paper is to characterize price transmission and volatility spillovers among producer and consumer prices for wheat in Slovenia using recent price data. While on the supply side, wheat production plays a crucial economic role in the less developed Eastern part of Slovenia, on the demand side, it strongly affects households’ food expenditures. In order to achieve our research objective, a TVECM-MGARCH model with exogenous variables is fit to price data. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has jointly estimated both models to study price transmission and volatility spillovers along the food marketing chain.
Two regimes are found to describe price-level dynamics. While the first regime is characterized by high retail margins, the second involves low retail profits. Probably due to the high market power exerted by retailers, prices do not react to deviations from their long-run parity in the first regime. However, both prices are found to adjust in the second regime, where deviations from the long-run parity damage the interests of retailers. Results also suggest strong links between the Slovenian wheat market and the international market represented by a negative correlation between changes in international wheat stocks-to-use ratio and Slovenia wheat producer prices. Volatility spillovers between consumer and producer markets flow in both directions. The mechanisms through which these instabilities are transmitted however differ: while past volatility in the consumer market induces current volatility in producer prices, past producer market shocks cause instability in consumer prices. Further, higher interest rates are found to destabilize producer markets. VIRFs show that price system shocks cause higher instability on producer than on consumer prices. The volatility effects of these shocks disappear after about 8 to 9 months.
Paper results provide some important policy implications. First, retail marketing margins increases at the expense of producer margins (the second regime) may constitute supporting evidence of non-competitive agreements among millers, as well as other forms of market power down the marketing chain. These price patterns may push less competitive agricultural producers out of the sector. EU Common Agricultural Policy direct payments may be however counteracting this effect. Second, evidence is found that stabilization of price behavior at one level of the marketing chain will bring stability at the other levels. As a result, any policy directed towards guaranteeing stable agricultural producer incomes will also lead to more stable consumer prices. Third, international stock changes appear to exert a relevant influence on national food price levels, but not on their fluctuations. In contrast, market price instability seems to be related with macroeconomic conditions, specifically to high interest rates. Macroeconomic policy is thus likely to have an impact on food price volatility.
