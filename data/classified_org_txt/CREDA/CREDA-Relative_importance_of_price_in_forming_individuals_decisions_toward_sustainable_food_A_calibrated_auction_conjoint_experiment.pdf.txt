Relative importance of price in forming individuals decisions towards sustainable 

food: a calibrated auction-conjoint experiment 

 

Abstract 

 

This paper explores the importance of pricing information in dealing with sustainable 

food preferences. It employs the Calibrated Auction-Conjoint Valuation Method 

(CACM), by comparing non-adjusted values from a self-explicated (hypothetical) 

conjoint method to the final calibrated values entered into an adjusted (real) auction.  

We found consumers significantly reduced their WTP when moving from the initial 

stage of the CACM ( hypothetical self-explicated conjoint method) to the final stage 

(real auction), primarily by placing more importance on product prices, implying that 

WTP values from a self-explicated conjoint method used alone would likely lead to 

overstated estimates of WTP. 

  

 

Keywords: Calibrated Auction-Conjoint Valuation, willingness-to-pay, sustainable

1. Introduction 

 

During the last century European agriculture has intensified its production practices 

partially financed by the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) (Gardner, 1992 

and 2002; Rude, 2001). This strategy responds to technological development incentives 

and profit maximization policies among other reasons, implying greater focus on 

continuous farming systems, increasing the use of farm inputs as well as irrigated lands 

or employing highly productive varieties. As a result, yields have been increased with 

some environmental side effects such as contamination of surface and ground water and 

loss of biodiversity due to the reduction of natural habitats, among other costs. These 

externalities arising from the intensification of conventional agriculture did have 

important effects on human health, animal welfare, and especially on the environment.  

 

The growing interests of European consumers in the environmental effects of 

conventional agriculture have raised interest in sustainability (Chen, 2007). 

Consequently, consumers are increasing their interest towards alternative farming 

practices such as organic agriculture, placing sustainable agriculture as an interesting 

alternative for consumption (Chen, 2007). Consumer preferences for sustainability are 

related to how the goods are produced and how consumers value pollution emissions, 

use of chemical fertilizers, etc. (Hamilton and Zilberman, 2006). 

Sustainable agriculture is often described as a food production system that causes less 

degradation of the ecological system compared to conventional production systems 

(Quenum, 2010). There are two main sustainable farming production systems: 



3 
 

integrated (IF) and organic farming (OF). See Table 1 for a summary of the main 

differences between conventional farming, IF and OF.  

Table 1. Description of agricultural production systems 
 
Systems Descriptions 

Conventional In these production systems were promoted intensive irrigation systems in wide 
open plains, monoculture plantations and expensive external inputs. Although has 
a random control the conventional systems allow the use of fertilizers, pesticides 
and herbicides. No need an associated certification for the plant material and do 
not have any kind of certification. It allows the use of any postharvest treatment 
according to law. These systems not explicitly consider the environmental impact 
simply follow the existing general regulations. 

Integrated In these productions exists a mandatory control. It allows the use of fertilizers but 
differs from the conventional systems that the integrated systems enhances the 
applications of natural fertilizers and reduces the use of mineral and chemical 
synthesis fertilizers. Allows the use of pesticides (synthetic chemicals) as long as 
it is a rational application and the use of certain herbicides in some conditions. 
For both have to precede the biological methods than the chemical ones. A 
certification is needed for the plant material. The uses of postharvest treatments 
are authorized if they are technically justified. Priority is given to physical 
methods.  Integrated systems have a certification and the produce respects the 
environment and minimizing environment impact.  

Organic The organic production has a mandatory control. It allows the uses of natural 
extractive mineral and organic fertilizers. The uses of mineral and chemical 
fertilizers are prohibited.  The pesticides and herbicides (synthetic chemical 
products) are prohibited. For the plant material is necessary to use organic plant 
material certified or from authorized producers. The postharvest treatment is 
prohibited, unless they are natural like the use of hot water. All the products have 
a certification and the produce supports the biodiversity, respecting the 
environment and minimizing environmental impact.  

 

Worldwide land devoted to OF has experienced a growth during the last decade. In late 

2003, worldwide land devoted to organic agriculture was estimated at 26.5 million 

hectares, increasing in about 69% compared with 1998 (Mc Donald, 2001). In 2006, 

nearly 30.4 million hectares were devoted to OF, which constituted 0.65% of total 

agricultural land in the countries considered in the SOEL-FiBL survey (Foundation 

Ecology and Agriculture) - (Research Institute of Organic Agriculture). More recently, 

in the last survey realized by SOEL-FiBL, in 2011, it was reported that worldwide about 



4 
 

37.2 million of hectares were devoted to OF, which constitutes approximately a 0.9% of 

global agricultural land. In contrast, no international reliable data on IF is available 

since there not considered by any international or European regulation; therefore each 

member state has its own regulation, resulting in consequent differences among 

countries.  

 

The geographical areas with larger amounts of land allocated to OF are Oceania, Europe 

and Latin America. Within Europe, Spain is the country with a higher number of 

hectares allocated to OF (Willer, 2011). In 2011, Spain had in 2011 1.85 million of 

hectares devoted to organic farming (67.7% was qualified as organic farming, 14.8% 

was qualified as “in conversion” to organic farming and the remaining 17.5% were 

qualified as “in the first year of practices”) (MAGRAMA, 2012). Unlike, In Spain there 

are just 803,408 hectares of IF (MAGRAMA, 2013).  Therefore, there are few products 

in Spain produced simultaneously under Conventional, OF and IF. One of these are 

apples, covering 7% of Spanish total integrated area.  

 

World production of apples, according to FAO statistics, achieved 71.2 million tons in 

2009. China leads world’s apple production (44.4%), followed by United States (6.3%), 

Turkey (3.9 %), Poland (3.7%), Iran (3.4%) and Italy (3.2%). Only about 10.8% of 

world apple production is traded on international markets, and is controlled by six 

export countries: China, Chile, Italy, United States, Poland and France (FAO, 2010).  

Spain takes the place nineteen with 670,566 tons of exported apples (FAO, 2011). 

Consumption of apples in Spain is of 557, 26 million kilograms, that is about 12 

kilograms of apples per person (MAGRAMA, 2010).

For the purpose of this research, we compare conventional, integrated and organic apple 

production systems to determine consumers’ evaluations of, and WTP for, agro-

ecosystems preservation.  During the past decade, results from hypothetical valuation 

methods have been criticized because of the observation that consumers tend to 

overstate their WTP as compared to what happens in experiments with real economic 

incentives (e.g., List and Gallet, 2001). One of the most popular valuation methods is 

conjoint analysis (Green and Rao, 1971). However, conjoint methods typically do not 

offer immediate financial consequences. Another interesting method is the discrete 

choice method, widely used in previous research (Ding et al., 2005; Louviere and Street, 

2000; Lusk and Shroeder, 2004, Janssen and Hamm, 2012). Discrete choice does allow 

a financial estimation but is often limited in the number of attributes that can be feasibly 

studied.   

 

This study reports on an attempt to overcome both of these weaknesses of traditional 

valuation methods in an application involving a complex, multi-attribute good: agro 

ecosystem preservation. The present study utilized the Calibrated Auction-Conjoint 

Valuation Method (CACM) introduced by Norwood and Lusk (2011), to determine both 

consumer preferences for sustainable farming (organic and integrated versus 

conventional) and to understand the relative importance of price in forming individuals 

decisions towards sustainable food. Moreover, in addition to linking the auction bids 

with the conjoint rating to investigate consumer preferences for sustainable farming, we 

compare the non-adjusted values (obtained from the hypothetical self-explicated 

conjoint method) to the final calibrated values entered into an auction to explore the 

internal consistency of people’s behaviors and the relevance of the price attribute versus 

agro-ecosystems preservation in the market for apples. This has not been done 



6 
 

previously by Norwood and Lusk (2011) and therefore is a contribution of the present 

study to the literature. Therefore, the paper contribution deals with both empirical 

findings on consumers’ behavior toward sustainable produced food and method testing.  

  

The next section outlines the methodological framework. Section 3 is devoted to the 

description of the methods, data, and analytical procedures. The fourth section reports 

the results. Section five contains the concluding remarks. 

  

2. Background 

Incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms can be categorized into two general 

categories: experimental auctions and non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments 

(Corrigan et al., 2009; Lusk and Shogren, 2007; Lusk and Schroeder, 2004). One of the 

main advantages of experimental auctions is that they place subjects in an active market 

environment where they can learn and adjust to market conditions. In addition, bids 

provide researchers an explicit estimate for each participant’s WTP without the need to 

estimate an econometric model. Non-hypothetical choice experiments incorporate 

incentives into the traditional conjoint method by randomly selecting one of the several 

repeated choices between competing product profiles as the binding. The participant 

purchases the product indicated as most preferred in the randomly selected choice set 

(Alfnes et al., 2006; Carlsson and Martinsson, 2001; Ding, et al., 2005; Ding, 2007; 

Lusk and Schoroeder, 2004; Lusk et al., 2008; Janssen and Hamm 2012).  

 

The upside of non-hypothetical choice experiments is that they are easy for people to 

answer, being more similar to the choices people make in the marketplace. The 

downside is that choice experiments can require sophisticated experimental designs and 



7 
 

econometric estimates to derive WTP estimates.  Recently, Norwood and Lusk (2011) 

suggested an approach combining the strengths of conjoint and auction elicitation 

methods in a procedure that promotes systematic and rational behavior; they referred to 

the approach as the Calibrated Auction Conjoint valuation Method (CACM). 

 

With the CACM, people calibrate their attribute-based utility functions to produce the 

auction bids they desire. The CACM has several advantages over existing valuation 

approaches. First, it imposes a mechanical or algebraic relationship between valuations 

and utility by linking auction bids with conjoint ratings and an underlying utility 

function which generates consistent and systematic responses. Second, the CACM is an 

iterative valuation process that promotes learning and provides feedback, helping 

subjects to form rational preferences. Third, it allows for a distribution-free 

characterization of heterogeneity regarding preferences.  Finally, the CACM allows for 

the evaluation of a large number of attributes and attribute-levels while enabling the 

estimation of people’s values for a very large number of products (see Norwood and 

Lusk, 2011). 

 

 

3. Methods, data and analytical procedure 

 

3.1. The data  

 

The data used in this study were collected by means of a two-step experiment: a first 

part dealing with a hypothetical exercise and a second part with real economic 

incentives. To perform the experiment, a specific software program was developed 



8 
 

using Visual Basic. A sample of consumers from Barcelona (Spain) was recruited by a 

marketing research company for the purpose of this study. Participants were recruited 

by phone to participate in an “apple preference study” and were promised 20€ for their 

participation. The selection of apples as the product of study responds to the aim of 

valuing the behavior towards a fresh product. In addition, apples are commonly 

consumed by the general public and of easy conservation. The last reason is that there 

are few products in Spain produced under the three systems of interest of this research. 

Eight sessions of 10 participants each were conducted in March 2010. The main socio-

demographic characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 2. The sample was made 

up of 40% men and 60% women. Almost 70% of the respondents were between 35 and 

65 years old. As expected, the majority of the sample (more than 80%) had finished 

secondary school and had a medium household income level (from 1000 to 5000 

€/month family).

3.2. Experiment design 

The CACM works as follows. First, participants answer a series of simple rating 

questions where they indicate the relative desirability of different product attributes and 

the associated levels of each attribute.  This step uses the so-called self-explicated 

conjoint approach and can accommodate a large number of attributes and attribute 

levels, as the analyst is not required to use a specific experimental design. Second, a 

computer takes the ratings to construct a utility function for specific products as defined 

by the underlying attributes, and calculates each respondent’s WTP for the products 

relative to the valuation of a base level. Up to this point the method works as a 

hypothetical experiment. Third,  the calculated WTP values are shown to participants 

and they are told that from now on the experiment will be real and, therefore, are asked 

to return to step 2 to readjust (or calibrate) their ratings (and indirectly the utility 

function) if they wish to change their WTP. Finally, once subjects are settled on their 

WTP values, they are entered as bids into an incentive-compatible experimental auction. 

 

The experiment was conducted in two stages1: 1) welcome and introduction to the 

experiment and 2) the CACM. During the introductory stage, each respondent was 

seated in a cubicle with a computer. Then, a brief explanation of the experiment 

objectives and confidentiality of the data was provided.   

 

The second stage of the experiment consisted of the CACM. Following Norwood and 

Lusk (2011), respondents were first asked to rank their preference for different 

characteristics associated with three different production systems (organic, integrated 
                                                           
1 First of all, a pilot experiment was conducted. Its aim was to test both the “software” developed for the 
CACM experiment and the methodology that would be used for the auction. A total of 10 participants 
(students and colleagues) were employed.

and conventional production). To select and define the attributes associated with the 

different production systems, a focus group2 with experts was previously conducted by 

the research team. The focus group was integrated by three technical experts, two 

professors of agriculture and two farmers of organic food.   

 

The selected attributes were price, environmental impact, the use of fertilizers, 

pesticides and herbicides, plant material, post-harvest treatments, and certification (see 

Table 3 for a description of the attributes and levels as they were delivered to the 

respondents). Before starting this stage of the experiment (hypothetical exercise), a 

cheap-talk script (Cummings and Taylor, 1999) was introduced in order to reduce 

respondents’ WTP in hypothetical experiments. Finally, we asked consumers to be 

careful and think about their answers.  

 

Collection of data for the CACM proceeded in four steps3 : Step 1: Participants were 

shown numerous tables on the computer screen that corresponded to each of the 

attributes studied.  In each table, the respondents were asked to rate the desirability of 

each attribute-level on a 1 to 10 scale, where 1 was very undesirable and 10 was very 

desirable.  In each case, and previous to the participant’s evaluation, a full description of 

each attribute level was presented4 (See Figure 1 as an example).  

 

                                                           
2“ carefully planned series of discussions designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a 
permissive, non-threatening environment” (Krueger and Casey, 2000, p. 5) 
3 The whole experiment was not explained to respondents at the beginning of the experiment. We did 
explain the experiment step by step.   
4 The CACM design in this study does not accommodate non-compensatory decision rules. However, this 
could be easily taken into account following Srinivasan and Park (1987) by add a simple check-box 
allowing consumers to indicate they wouldn’t pick a product with that attribute not matter how attractive 
were all the other attributes.  In any case, if someone has non-compensatory preferences, it would imply 
they would be willing-to-pay exactly zero for alternatives that had attributes with the completely 
undesirable level.  As we show latter, however, we did not observe any zero WTP values, suggesting this 
is not a problem in our particular study.

Step 2: Participants were asked to indicate the relative importance of each attribute 

when purchasing apples on a 1 to 7 scale, where 1 was very unimportant and 7 was very 

important (see Figure 2). Respondents were encouraged to think about the relative 

importance.  

The first two steps mirror the approach used in self-explicated conjoint studies (see 

Srinivasan and Park, 1997).

Step 3: The next step of the CACM consisted of an auction5. The bids were calculated 

using the data collected in steps 1 and 2, and the subjects were told that their bids 

should be adjusted to reflect the highest amount of money that they were willing to pay 

for one kilo of each of the three different kinds of apples.  

 

Participants were asked to bid for a kilo of conventional apples (this was not a 

prediction from the CACM)6. Following Norwood and Lusk (2011), a bid was 

forecasted for two other products (organic and integrated) using each person’s previous 

responses to the ranking questions in steps 1 and 2. Each individual’s relative WTP for 

each apple product is derived from the difference in utilities between two alternatives 

divided by the marginal utility of income, following Norwood and Lusk (2011). The 

alternatives entailing each production system (conventional, organic and integrated) 

differ in their attribute levels as presented in Table 3.  

First, individual i’s attribute-based utility for a kilogram of each apple type j  

was calculated by multiplying the relative importance of each attribute, using data 

obtained from stages 1 and 2 of the CACM as follows: 

(1)  

where  represents the stated importance of the  attribute normalized so as =1 

(selected by respondents in step 2; Figure2). Furthermore,  represents the rating of 

the  of the  attribute, normalized so that the lowest rated level of each attribute has 

a scaled rating of 0 and the highest rated level of each attribute has a scaled rating of 1 
                                                           
5 People were trained on the use of the bidding procedures. Consumers participated in an auction for a 
mineral water 33cl bottle to become familiarized with the procedures. The mineral water auction was 
designed to mimic the apple auctions to facilitate the learning process. 
6 We need this value because the utility model only gives us differences in utility instead of total values.

(selected by respondents in step 1; Figure1).  is the number of levels over which the 

 attribute is varied, K is the number of attributes.  is a dummy variable that 

equals to 1 if apple product j processes the  level of the  attribute, and 0 if 

otherwise. The term  can be interpreted as a utility “part-worth,” which is the 

utility provided from the  level of the  attribute. This part-worth is analogous to 

the coefficients in a random utility model estimated from a conjoint analysis, with  

being the explanatory variable for presence or absence in the conjoint analysis.  

 

Lastly, the willingness-to-pay to purchase one product (j) versus another (product t) was 

calculated by dividing non-price utility differences between the products (equation 1) by 

the “part-worth” on price, which represents the marginal utility of income 

 where   is the normalized price attribute (Norwood and 

Lusk, 2011)7. The forecasted bids were shown to people together with the relative 

importance of each attribute level by means of a bar chart (see Figure 3).

7 Price trade-off  is calculated using person’s utility function and no interpersonal comparisons are made.  



15 
 

An E-02 must be added to the numerical values for plant material, post-harvest treatment and certification.  It was not shown in 
Figure 3 due to the format of the resulting box. Respondents were informed about this issue during the experiment. 

 

Of course, the forecasted WTP values may differ from what people are actually willing 

to pay.  

Step 4: At the last step of the CACM consumers were told that the winner of the auction 

would have to pay for the kilo of apples that would be selected. However, the only way 

for people to change their bids was to go back and change the relative importance of the 

attributes provided in step 2. This step forces an internal consistency between economic 

valuations and the underlying utility function that maps preferences for agricultural 

production attributes to the apples produced under different conditions. 

 

Participants had the opportunity to change the relative importance of each product 

attribute by means of a drop-down box. Simultaneous with the adjustment of the 

attribute importance, people could see how their bids changed for the three types of 

apples as their ratings changed. It‘s important to highlight that respondents don not only 

notice about the change in the bids but also in the relative importance of the different 

attributers by means of a bar chart as presented in Figure 3. Once the participants were 

satisfied with their bids, they hit the submit button. The final bids appeared on the 

screen. One production system (i.e., conventional, organic or integrated) was randomly 

selected. The highest bidder for the chosen type of apples was announced as the winner 

of the auction. (S)he took the chosen apples home after paying the second highest bid.  

 

Our computer program kept track of subject’s initial ratings in steps 1, 2 and 3. These 

are the data that a marketing analyst would normally use to compute subjects’ WTP and 

market share. However, these reflect the subjects’ ratings before knowing that the 



16 
 

submitted bids would subsequently be entered into an auction and therefore would have 

to pay for them. By comparing the implied WTP values that resulted after subjects first 

completed steps 1, 2 and 3 to the final submitted bids, we can determine the effect of the 

CACM procedure (and the move from non-adjusted to real (adjusted) economic 

environments) on consumers’ valuations. 

 

4. Results  

Table 4 and figures 4 and 5 presents the main statistics associated to the utility part-

worth before and after the adjustment. The average utility for the conventional 

production system is 0.1217. This value increased to 0.5461 for integrated apples and to 

0.5777 for organic apples. It is interesting to see that after adjustment, the average 

utility for integrated and organic apples decreases to 0.4398 and 0.4635 respectively. 

These results illustrated that participants positively value environmentally friendly 

production systems and especially organic products. This can be explained because the 

certification and legislation associated to organic production is well known among 

consumers while for the case of integrated production they are at the earlier stages and, 

consequently, more unknown to consumers.

The bids from the CACM are shown in Table 5. Before the adjustment, the average bid 

for a kilogram of apples from the conventional production system was 1.15€. This value 

increased to 3.65€ for apples from integrated production systems and to 4.14€ for apples 

from organic production systems. It is interesting to see that after the adjustment, the 

value for the apples from the integrated production systems was of 2.76€. This finding 

implies a decrease of 24% compared to the initial case. Furthermore, the average bid for 

apples from organic production systems was 3.15€, which was 0.99€ less than the initial 

non-adjusted bid. Tables 6 and 7 show that  

WTP values are statistically different from one another considering the differences 

before and after the adjustment as well as the differences among production systems 

(conventional vs. organic vs. integrated)

These results suggest that participants positively value sustainable agriculture such as 

organic and integrated systems versus conventional one, illustrating the potential market 

for organic and integrated foods in Spain. However, this market probably requires better 

designed pricing and promotional strategies to inform consumers about the positive 

effects of such products on the environment and needs to take into account the real 

WTP. Additionally, results show that participants’ revealed a higher WTP for organic 

and integrated apples in non-adjusted than in adjusted settings. These results are 

consistent with findings by List and Gallet (2001) and Lusk and Schroeder (2004). In 

our case, the non-adjusted bias resulted primarily from the relative priority to price.

Figure 6 illustrates the differences between the WTP for the initial non-adjusted and the 

calibrated bids for a kilogram of both organic and integrated apples. We can see that 

about a 30% (33%) of respondents did not change their WTP for organic (integrated) 

apples, while for another 31% (28%) WTP changes were lower than 1 Euro. On the 

opposite side, around 10 % of participants adjusted their WTP for more than 5 Euros. 

It’s interesting to say that more than 70% of participants decreased their bids, while 

more than 20% of respondents kept their bids invariant for both organic and integrated 

apples. Just around a 5% of participants did increase their bids after the adjustment (see 

Figures 7 and 8).

To deeply analyze the differences between the non-adjusted and adjusted bids, Figures 9 

and 10 show respondents’ average rankings of the relative importance of the attributes 

associated to the production systems both before and after adjustments. As expected, the 

most important attribute was price8. However, it can be observed that the environmental 

protection attribute was also very important for the sample, followed by the use of 

pesticides. The rest of the attributes were considered as equally important. It must also 

be highlighted that after the adjustment, price relevance increased in about 16 

percentage points. However, it is interesting to observe that when respondents modified 

                                                           
8 During the survey, consumers were asked about the role of price in their decisions when 
purchasing organic food. More than 81% of consumers placed high importance either on 
questions about price, price comparison or promotions. (At the time of shopping I compare the 
prices of possible alternatives; I pay attention to offers when I buy food; at the time of buying a 
product its price is very important to me.)

the relative importance of the rest of the attributes to increase the importance of price, 

they maintained almost the same ranking order as they revealed in the hypothetical 

experiment, which validates the rationality of their first step responses. In order to 

clarify the validity of the recalibration we have performed a paired t-test in order to 

compare the attributes means before and after the adjustment (see Table 8). Results 

suggest that the means for all the attributes are significantly different before and after 

adjustments, which leads us to conclude that all the attributes were indeed modified.

Table 9 shows the average WTP for selected changes in all attribute levels for apples, or 

the WTP for shifting from one level (representing a specific production system) on each 

attribute to another level of the same attribute (representing another production system). 

The results are presented for the two bids (non-adjusted and adjusted). We can observe 

a positive WTP in shifting from conventional production to organic or integrated 

production for all attributes in both settings previous and after the adjustment. However, 

no significant differences can be observed if we compare the two sustainable production 

systems. It’s important to emphasize the decrease in the WTP when comparing the 

adjusted from the non adjusted bids. This indicates that in the first stage of the 

experiment, hypothetical bids, participants overstate the desirability of the attributes.

5. Conclusions 



25 
 

 

Our results show that people’s valuations of apples are affected by the production 

system and that Spanish respondents place a higher value on organic products in 

comparison to ones obtained from integrated or conventional production systems. 

However, among a set of attributes associated with a production system (e.g., price; 

environmental impact; the use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides; plant material; 

post-harvest treatments; and certification), price had a higher relative importance, 

followed by the environmental impact of the production system.  

This study compared a non-adjusted (hypothetical self-explicated) conjoint valuation 

experiment and an incentive compatible calibrate experiment using the Calibrated 

Auction – Conjoint Valuation Method proposed by Norwood and Lusk (2011). On 

average, respondents were willing to pay 1.15, 3.65 and 4.14 Euros for a kilogram of 

conventional, integrated and organic apples, respectively, for the non-adjusted 

(hypothetic) bid. For the incentive-compatible experiment, the biding decreased to 2.76 

and 3.15 Euros for a kilogram of integrated and organic apples. It is important to 

highlight that when respondents decreased their WTP due to the introduction of 

monetary incentives, this was done in a rational way or that the relative importance of 

the other attributes was maintained in the same relative proportion as was done in the 

first bidding.  

Therefore, we can conclude first that price does have a relevant role on defining 

consumers’ WTP sustainable food and therefore the market for organic and integrated 

food may have to better adjust its price in order to reach wide-ranging consumers. 

Second, we noticed that there is a lack of information among Spanish consumers 

regarding to integrated production. This result is in line with Janssen and Hamm (2012) 

who emphasized the necessity of increasing consumer awareness of the organic logo to 



26 
 

have an effect of their perceptions and attitudes towards certified food. Finally, we can 

state that a self-explicated conjoint method used alone would likely lead to overstated 

estimates of WTP and that the CACM methodology allows respondents to develop a 

rational behavior in the bidding experiment.  

Furthermore, it will be interesting for future research to explore if the order of bids 

matters.  That is, if we will obtain the same results if the elicitation bids are done for the 

organic products and the forecasted for conventional and integrated ones.
