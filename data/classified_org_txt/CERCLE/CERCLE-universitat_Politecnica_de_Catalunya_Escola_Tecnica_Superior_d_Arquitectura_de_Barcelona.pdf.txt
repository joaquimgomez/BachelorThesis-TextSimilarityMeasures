It is probably a widespread opinion that the ETSAB specially 
emphasizes the areas of relationship between the projects 
and the context, especially with the urban context.

If this were true, the selection of projects that we present in 
this publication would confirm, without premeditation, this 
hypothesis.

I have to admit that in the last five years, starting with the 
verification of the failure of the Forum Barcelona 2004 
(futile repetition of the formula Olympic Games =  big event 
= urban development) and finishing with the apotheosis of 
the obscene capitalism, our point of view about architecture 
developed in an environment of growing isolation.

Times have changed and I hope we can bring back to the 
architectural conversation that an action transforms and 
depends on the site, even if the site was in the desert. 
We knew it regarding the urban context and we will now 
demonstrate the inhabitable qualities of infrastructures and 
those they will create.

Yes, we play architecture as a team, but that does not imply 
any determinism, quite the opposite: it expands the field. 

Playing this way is not so strange, although it is difficult: pay 
attention to how FC Barcelona does it.

The start of the project considers two elements: the two kilometers of the existing track and 
its proximity to the highway. This big scale intervention focuses on the “in-motion circulation” 
as a new way of living for the project and the landscape. It is the car, the new user of the new 
programmatic infrastructure, that surrounds and revitalizes the old automobile track.

The project starts from the redefinition of the current building's outline, responding to a 
duality between an interior and exterior of the block of different urban characteristics. It 
includes two different programs that are easily related. The public space and the use of the 
bicycle play a crucial role in the project's success.

In the proposed project, the platform of the Stockholm Public Library is extended in order 
to create the connection with the new building. The expansion meets the library with a light 
structure to preserve the importance of Asplund's building, while the main portion is placed 
in the opposite side of the site. An orthogonal volume is bent in approaching the library to 
create the link between both buildings. The new library faces the hill of the Stockholm Ridge, 
generating a new public area and at the same time creating an ordered barrier with the street.

The “Conservatori del Liceu” ties the sky with the ground of Barcelona. Public space, above, 
attracts the street up to the roofs. Underneath, the classrooms remain protected by the return 
path materialized in the form of a ramp. Education and delight of music are fused with the city 
from its roofs.

new topography for 
“aUtÒdrom st. pere de ribes"
roger trias Carol

The project recovers the old St. Pere de Ribes circuit and converts it into a test zone where an 
automobile manufacturing company could establish their regional headquarters. The project 
organizes the site through a strip strategy. The stripes fold and generate a new topography 
that contains the program: a hotel, offices, residential units, and museum display area. The 
concrete strip itself is key to the dialogue with the landscape. By minimizing the trace — the 
gesture, the folding creates the architecture and relationship with the site.
