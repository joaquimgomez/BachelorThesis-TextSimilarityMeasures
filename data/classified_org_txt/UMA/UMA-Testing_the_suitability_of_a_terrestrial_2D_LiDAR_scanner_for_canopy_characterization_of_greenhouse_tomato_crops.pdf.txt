Abstract:  15 

Canopy characterization is a key factor to adjust pesticide dosage to the amount of vegetation. This 16 
fact becomes especially important when the target is a fresh exportable vegetable like tomato 17 
produced in greenhouse. The particularities of this crop, whose plants are thin, tall and planted in 18 
pairs, make difficult their characterization with electronic methods. The present study attempts to 19 
assess the accuracy of the terrestrial 2D LiDAR sensor for determining major canopy parameters 20 
related to its volume and density and it establishes useful correlations between manual and 21 
electronic parameters for leaf area estimation. The experiments were carried out at three different 22 
commercial tomato greenhouses planted in a twin row system. The electronic characterization was 23 
done with a LiDAR sensor (LMS-200, SICK) of 180º angle measurement by scanning the pair of 24 
plants by both sides. The main parameters obtained were: canopy height, canopy width, canopy 25 
volume and leaf area. From these, other important parameters were calculated, like the tree row 26 
volume (TRV), the leaf wall area (LWA), the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD). A 27 
general overview of the results show an overestimation of the parameters with manual 28 
measurements due to the high definition of the profile obtained with this sensor. The estimation of 29 
the canopy volume with the electronic device showed to be a reliable parameter to estimate the 30 
canopy height, volume and density. Also, the LiDAR scanner demonstrated to be able to assess the 31 
high variability of the canopy density along the row, resulting to be an important tool for canopy 32 
maps generation.  33

1. Introduction 38 

The public concern due to the environmental problems associated with the inaccurate pesticide 39 
application process led the European Administration to develop a regulatory framework that was 40 
established with the European Directive 2009/128/EC [1]. In this document, the need to improve the 41 
efficiency in the use of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) is remarked, and one of the guidelines to 42

achieve this goal is the dose adjustment to the real needs, avoiding overdosing and, therefore, 43 
unnecessary PPP losses to the environment. 44 

The greenhouse tomato crop, grown to be consumed as a fresh product, is very important in 45 
Spain, with a cultivated area of 6189 ha [2]. Being important an accurate application of pesticides in 46 
all kind of crops or circumstances, those related to fresh products to be directly commercialized in 47 
the market, need a very accurate and safe use of pesticides in order to prevent health risks. Pesticide 48 
residues on vegetables constitute a possible risk to consumers and have been a human health 49 
concern [3]. In contrast, even though some works have been done at evaluating the optimal volumes 50 
to be applied [4–5], not enough research has been done to relate all the parameters affecting the 51 
relationship between the canopy characteristics and the amount of PPP according to the real needs. 52 

Greenhouse tomato rises from the ground and develops a long stem, which is fixed by the 53 
farmer to a fixed structure to make it stay in a vertical disposition. Therefore, this crop belongs to the 54 
group of those called 3D crops, i.e., crops that present a complex geometry for the sprayer, in 55 
opposition to the arable crops, that are treated as if they were a flat, 2D target. The constant pressure 56 
that generates a constant liquid flow rate has shown to not to be valid for 3D crops [6], as the varying 57 
geometry of the different individuals make very difficult to set a general application volume that 58 
results in a satisfactory application quality. This fact led the researchers to set other systems that 59 
focus on different parameters relative to the canopy structure. Thus, the first two methodologies to 60 
appear were the Tree Row Volume (TRV) and the Leaf Wall Area (LWA). The TRV method consists 61 
of calculating the canopy volume by assuming its prismatic shape, so the canopy height and width, 62 
along with the row spacing, are the base parameters to determine the TRV, expressed in m3 canopy 63 
per ha ground [7–8]. The application volume will be proportional to this TRV parameter according 64 
to a specific coefficient that will have different values according to the crop [9–11]. The Leaf Wall 65 
Area, on the other hand, is based on the assumption that the canopy sides are completely flat, so they 66 
form a “wall”. The main parameter to calculate LWA is the canopy height [12], so this method 67 
ignores the canopy width. The LWA is expressed in m2 leaf wall area per ground ha. The sprayed 68 
dose is calculated for every 10.000 m2 LWA. These two systems are well implanted and nowadays 69 
there is a general discussion between the countries of the European Union in which of these systems 70 
should be used as the standard label dosing system for all the crops [13–14]. Nevertheless, in the last 71 
years, different authors proposed alternative systems as the TRV and LWA do not take into account 72 
a canopy parameter of major importance, the leaf density [14], so this method needs to be completed 73 
with further information. Therefore, different dosing systems appeared for different crops, as 74 
vineyards, citrus or fruit trees, like apple [6, 15–18]. Even though they differ in their basis, 75 
assumptions and calculations, they all have something in common: they have to rely on an accurate 76 
canopy characterization system. 77 

Canopy characterization is a complex task that has been solved in the last years in very different 78 
ways. The canopy characterization methods can be classified in two general categories: manual and 79 
electronic methods. The manual methods are those that are based on manual measurements 80 
performed with measuring tape, topographic milestone, etc. These methods vary according to the 81 
canopy structure, and are much simpler in hedgerow orchards than in isolated trees or plants. Even 82 
though they are reliable, fast and simple to use for the farmer, they become less useful for more 83 
advanced task such as generating prescription maps for proportional spray application, like the one 84 
proposed by the aforementioned dosing systems. In addition, the canopy density results extremely 85 
difficult to evaluate with those methods, being necessary the complete defoliation of a representative 86 
sample of plants to obtain reliable values. Therefore, the electronic methods seem to be a very 87 
appropriate option to accomplish the requirements of the dose adjustment. Among the electronic 88 
characterization methods, the more frequent are the ultrasonic sensors [18–20], the stereo vision [22], 89 
the light sensors [23] and the LiDAR scanners [24–29]. According to Rosell and Sanz [30], LiDAR is 90 
the most accurate technology to characterize the canopy, and in fact it showed to be very reliable at 91 
predicting canopy parameters in different studies [20, 24, 31]. The LiDAR scanner is based on the 92 
principle of Time-Of-Flight (TOF) to calculate distances, i.e., the sensor measures the elapsed time 93 
between a laser beam emission and reception and automatically calculates the distance to the target 94

point [32]. This process is repeated along a plane in 2D scanners or in three dimensions, by rotating 95 
the scanning plane, in 3D LiDAR. The 2D sensor is cheaper and can have a third coordinate by 96 
moving it along the axis perpendicular to the scanning plane [24, 28], so it was more frequent for 97 
canopy characterization. 98 

The particularities of the tomato plants, which are thin, tall and planted in pairs, make difficult 99 
their characterization with electronic methods, as it is difficult to identify the parameters related to 100 
each individual plant. Furthermore, the narrow row spacing limits the field of view of the sensors 101 
used. The aims of the present study are: 1) To assess the accuracy of the LiDAR sensor for 102 
determining major canopy parameters related to its volume and density, 2) To establish useful 103 
correlations between manual and electronic parameters for the leaf area estimation, 3) To take 104 
advantage of the LiDAR technology to assess the variation of the canopy density throughout the 105 
row, for being the basis to generate canopy density maps for pesticide dose adjustment. 106

2. Materials and Methods  108 

2.1. Experimental fields. 109 

The experiments were carried out in three different tomato cultivar greenhouses (GH) located 110 
in El Ejido (Almería, Spain) (36° 45’ 22.90” N; 2° 48’ 34.89” W) and in Viladecans (Barcelona, Spain) 111 
(14° 18’ 46.46” N; 2° 1’ 48.44” W), both important fresh productive areas in the Spanish 112 
Mediterranean coast. The greenhouses had tomato crops of the varieties Velasco and Barbastro that 113 
were disposed in similar plantation patterns (Table 1). The plants were planted in a twin row system 114 
(Figure 1a) where the crop was planted by pairs on the same row. The three greenhouses had a main 115 
corridor with adjacent and perpendicular rows (Figure 1b). The row spacing, rs, the plant spacing in 116 
the row, ps, and the twin plant spacing, tps, are specified in Table 1 and represented in Figure 1b. 117

2.2. Manual canopy characterization 128 

For the manual canopy characterization, the total canopy height, HM, and the canopy width, 129 
WM, were measured along the row. The measurements were performed with a measuring tape by 130 
the same operators in the three fields of study, with 30 replications per field of study for each 131 
measurement. The HM was measured from the lowest leaves in the plant stem to the top leaf of each 132 
plant (Fig. 2). In the case of the canopy width, measures were taken from the outer to the inner part 133 
of the canopy, measuring separately each plant of the twin plant system grow (Fig. 2).  134 

The total leaf area per single plant was also determined. Thus, plants were collected by pairs, 2 135 
pairs (4 plants) for greenhouses 1 and 2 and 3 pairs (6 plants) for greenhouse 3. They were 136 
appropriately stored in sealed plastic bags. Then, in laboratory conditions and before the leaves had 137 
dried, they were removed from the plants and subsamples of 80 g weight were planimetered with a 138 
leaf planimeter (LI-COR LI 3100C, Lincoln, NE), obtaining the total leaf area of the subsample (cm2) 139 
and allowing the researchers to obtain the leaf area-weight ratio [4, 33, 34], which enables to obtain 140 
the leaf surface by only weighing the leaves, saving time. 141 

From these measured parameters, it was possible to calculate others, as the Tree Row Volume, 142 
TRV [7, 33, 35], the Leaf Wall Area, LWA [36, 37], the Leaf Area Index, LAI, and the Leaf Area 143 
Density, LAD [38, 39]. 144

2.3.1. Canopy scanning 151 
 152 

The scanner used for the study was a terrestrial 2D low-cost general-purpose LiDAR (LMS-200, 153 
Sick, Düsseldorf, Germany). This is a fully-automatic divergent laser scanner based on the 154 
measurement of time-of-flight (TOF) with an accuracy of ±15 mm in a single shot measurement and 155 
5 mm standard deviation in a range up to 8 m [20]. The sensor has a maximum scanning angle of 180 156 
degrees and a selectable angular resolution of 1º, 0.5º or 0.25º, though the first one showed to be 157 
accurate enough for canopy characterization studies [40], so it was chosen for the present work. The 158 
device was fed at 24 V voltage by an autonomous battery and it was connected to a laptop via RS-232 159 
Serial port for the data transmission.   160 

The sensor was set in the center of the space between the crop rows and it was mounted 161 
opposed to the canopy in a way that it can properly scan the whole plants, from the base to the top 162 
(Fig. 2). The sensor was then moved along a constant track, scanning the pair of plants by both sides. 163 
Even though it was not possible to scan the same plant from both sides because of their paired 164 
disposition, the high resolution of the scanner made possible that a high percentage of the laser 165 
beams penetrate the first plant and scan the second. Furthermore, three replications per side and 166 
canopy section were undertaken. 167 

During the scanning process, two types of structures were used: in greenhouses 1 (GH1) and 2 168 
(GH2), the LiDAR sensor was mounted on a mobile platform that was manually pulled at a constant 169 
average speed (0.06 m·s-1±0.009) to make it slide along an aluminum rail of 2.4 m long mounted on 170 
trestles (Fig. 3b). At greenhouse 3 (GH3), the LiDAR sensor was mounted on an autonomous 171 
spraying platform described in Balsari et al. [41] (Fig. 3c). This platform was moved by an electric 172 
engine and commanded by remote radio control. In both cases data acquiring laptop was mounted 173 
on the platform to ease the wiring connections.   174 

Due to mobility of the autonomous platform in the GH3, it was possible to scan the whole 175 
tomato row (23.4m long) by both sides of the canopy with 3 replications. These measurements 176 
enables to obtain information of the canopy variation in the row. . 177

2.3.1. Data processing 184 
Data from LiDAR sensor was obtained in polar coordinates (each point has an angle direction 185 

and distance response). To manage the information, it was needed to convert raw data to XYZ 186 
coordinates with R-software® (3.0.2) (R Development Core Team, 2013) were X axis corresponds to 187 
the width of the plant, Y axis is the height of the plant and Z axis is the length of the row (Fig. 4a).  188 

Due to the fact that two different structures were used to carry the LiDAR sensor to take the 189 
measurements there could be differences in the analyzed values. Furthermore, the forward speed of 190 
the sensor was irregular among different replications (coefficient of variation 16.8%) in the case of 191 
the fixed structure as it was manually driven. Therefore, all the data were normalized by taking into 192 
account the forward speed of the mobile sensor and the scanning frequency (Hz). This speed was 193 
calculated in the analysis process as the data acquisition system registers the time elapsed since the 194 
beginning of the data recording, and taking into account that the LiDAR track’s length was known. 195 

Once the data were appropriately normalized, results were imported in the CloudCompare ® 196 
software in order to see the LiDAR points cloud in 3D and to check that there were no problems or 197 
irregularities in the data acquisition process or in the data normalization. As the LiDAR sensor does 198 
not only scan the plants, but the greenhouse’s top and ground and the sensor support system as 199 
well, it was necessary to define and select the points that belong to the canopy from the others. This 200 
process was arranged for each scanning file (by side) by observing the point cloud from a Z axis with 201 
orthographic projection and determining some border points by setting one of known coordinates 202 
and obtaining the rest from the first (Fig. 4a). After that process, both sides of scanned plants where 203 
manually aligned and positioned to define the whole canopy structure (Fig. 4b) 204 

After this first approach, it was necessary to delimitate the points belong to each one of the two 205 
paired plants (Fig. 4b). This process was carried out manually by determining the center between 206 
them, which was assigned as (0,0) coordinate. 207

 212 
At this stage, it was possible to obtain or calculate different parameters from the LiDAR points 213 

cloud, as the canopy height, HL and width, WL, the number of points on the target, IMP, and the 214 
canopy volume, VL. 215 

To calculate HL, the difference between the highest and lowest points in each LiDAR slice (Fig. 216 
4a), i.e., the maximum length in Y axis for each LiDAR profile, was determined. HL was then 217 
calculated as the 95% of the maximum value among all that were determined previously. This 95% 218 
value was chosen to filter possible unusual profiles or data errors that could affect the reliability of 219 
the measurement. WL is calculated by determining the half of the total width, measured on X axis, of 220 
each two paired plants. Once this distance was known, WL was obtained as the 95% of the value, for 221 
the aforementioned reasons. 222 

IMP parameter was determined as the number of LiDAR beams that impacted on the canopy 223 
per row length unit (impacts · m-1). This parameter was included in the analysis process due to its 224 
significant correlation with manually measured LAI values in a previous research performed in 225 
vineyard [20] 226 

In order to obtain the canopy volume per single plant, VL, the methodology described in Xu et 227 
al. [41] and in Miranda-Fuentes et al. [40] was applied. This methodology is based on dividing the 228 
point cloud corresponding to the whole canopy in horizontal slices of a certain height, Δh. Next, all 229 
the points belonging to the same slice are projected on the same horizontal plane. Then, their 230 
external perimeter is delimited by using the Convex hull algorithm [43], and its inner area, Ai, 231 
determined. The volume of each slice, VL, can be calculated as its internal area, Ai, by its height, Δh. 232 
The total volume of the plant is, therefore, calculated as expressed in Eq. 1. 233 

𝑉𝑉𝐿𝐿 = ∑ 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 × ∆ℎ,                           (1) 234 
where n is the number of horizontal slices, VL is expressed in m3, Ai in m2 and Δh in m. 235 

 



Sensors 2016, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 4 

As it is evident, the lower the Δh, the higher the vertical resolution of the method. In some 236 
works, Δh values of 0.001 m have been used [42]. Nevertheless, values of 1 cm showed to be accurate 237 
enough in previous studies [40] and accelerate the calculation process. Therefore, Δh value for the 238 
present study was 0.01 m. 239 

 240 
2.3. Statistical analysis. 241 

The statistical analysis adopted was a linear correlation between all measured and calculated 242 
parameters, using statistical R-Software ® (3.0.2) (R Development Core Team, 2013) with the 243 
Agricolae package. The data analysis related all the measured and calculated results to identify the 244 
most significant and interesting correlations between them, always considering the manually 245 
measured parameters as a reference.  246 

A Shapiro-Wilk test (p > 0.05) [44, 45] and a visual inspection of the data histograms, normal 247 
Q-Q plots and box plots were performed to ensure that the data were normally distributed for all the 248 
cases. The interest of the linear correlations between the parameters obtained from the manual 249 
characterization, HM, WM, LAI, TRV, LAD and LWA, and those obtained from the LiDAR scanning 250 
of plants. HL, WL, VL and IMP was evaluated with the correlation p-values and their determination 251 
coefficients (R2). 252

3.1. Parameters from the canopy characterization 254 

A resume of those parameters obtained from the characterization can be found in Table 2. 255 

Table 2. Geometrical and density values for all the measured and calculated parameters. 256 

 257 

As it can be seen, the three fields of study had canopies of similar height characteristics. The 258 
maximum height of the plants grown is determined by the structure of the greenhouse instead of the 259 
growth of the plant, in which the stems are fixed to the greenhouse structure when they grow up to 260 
that level, continuing the growing process downwards, towards the ground. The canopy width is 261 
quite different overall in GH2, which presents also a low value of LAD. It is necessary to remember 262 
that width values were measured from the center between the two paired plants to the edge of each 263 
plant. These two parameters were very constant in all the studied fields, and specially the height.  264 

 



Sensors 2016, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 4 

The lowest value of TRV is found in GH2 (7771 m3·ha-1) that is strongly different from GH1 and 265 
GH3 (10882 and 10397 m3·ha-1 respectively). This differences can be explained by the difference in 266 
canopy width measured. Therefore the LWA did not follow the same trend that the TRV, having its 267 
maximum value in GH3, with 39170 m2 LWA ha-1and very similar values in GH1 and GH2. 268 

The LAD was the lowest for GH2 (3.15 m2 m-3), and very similar for the other two fields (5.81 269 
and 5.30 m2 m-3 for GH1 and GH3, respectively).  270 

As to the electronically measured parameters, the LiDAR height, HL showed to be, in general, 271 
lower than the manually measured, HM, with a mean value 12.12% lower. Nevertheless, the HL 272 
parameter followed a similar trend than the HM, with the maximum height being measured in GH2. 273 
The canopy width, on the other hand, was over-estimated by the scanner, but this occurred mainly 274 
in the case of GH2, in which the electronic method resulted in a 48% increment on the canopy width 275 
with respect to the manual measurements.  276 

As to the Standard Errors (SE) in the measurements, they are in general low, being below 10% 277 
in all the cases and in most of them below 1%. By comparing the SE obtained for all the parameters 278 
in the three GHs, they result very similar in the geometrical measurements, and slightly higher for 279 
the case of the LAD parameter, what is normal if taking into account the variability of this parameter 280 
along the canopy.  281

 289 
Considering the height (HL) parameter obtained with the LiDAR it has been significantly 290 

correlated with the manually measured height, HM (R2 = 0.59), with the manual width, WM (R2 = 0.52) 291 
and with TRV measured value (R2 = 0.46). Nevertheless, there is no correlation between HL and LWA 292 
(R2 = 0.004). This could be due to the fact that this parameter was not proportional to the canopy 293 
height in the three GHs, being the maximum in GH3 even when the maximum height was found in 294 
GH2 (Table 2).  295 

 



Sensors 2016, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 4 

The LiDAR width, WL, on the other hand, it was only significantly correlated with the LWA, 296 
even LWA calculation is not affected by the canopy width this correlation presented shows the 297 
importance of the width in this type of crops where the height is limited by the greenhouse structure.  298 

The LiDAR volume, VL, seems to be the most reliable parameter to estimate the canopy 299 
geometrical characteristics, as it is significantly correlated with HM, TRV and LWA, with 300 
determination coefficients of 0.69, 0.37 and 0.33, respectively. As it can be seen, determination 301 
coefficients for TRV and LWA are very similar, and for being statistically reliable, this parameter 302 
could be the most complete for the estimation of those two parameters. 303 

All the correlations between canopy density parameters, LAI and LAD, and the other 304 
parameters are included in Table 3. As it can be seen, there are interesting correlations among some 305 
manually measured geometrical parameters, like HM and WM, with the canopy density. In fact, both 306 
parameters are significantly related to the LAI (R2 = 0.60 and R2 = 0.70 for HM and WM, respectively), 307 
and to the LAD (R2 = 0.53 and R2 = 0.65 for HM and WM, respectively), what is not surprising as both 308 
density parameters are closely related. TRV values are highly correlated to LAI and LAD values, 309 
with determination coefficients of R2 = 0.89 and R2 = 0.79, respectively. LWA values, on the other 310 
hand, showed to not to be appropriate estimators of the leaf density, showing no significant 311 
correlations. The IMP parameter, expressed as the number of LiDAR impacts per length unit and 312 
that gave strong correlations with the leaf density parameter in previous works, showed to not to be 313 
accurate for predicting LAI or LAD values in tomato plants. More tests needs to be arranged in order 314 
to identify the reason of this difference.  315 

Figure 5 shows the correlations between LAI and VL (Fig. 5a) and between LAI and TRV (Fig. 316 
5b). As it can be seen, the TRV values are well aligned with those of LAI. VL, on the other hand, have 317 
a lower determination coefficient, R2 = 0.36. 318

By means of the mobile platform it was possible to scan the whole row from the two sides. As 325 

an example of the variation of the vegetation along the row, LAI parameter was used. This 326

 334 
Even though the variation range keeps relatively constant along the row, the continuous 335 

changes in the canopy reflect the important variation in LAI. Values usually range from 3 to 9, with 336 
exceptions like those found for the Z positions 6 m, 8 m and 22 m. The variation rate, calculated as 337 
the times that LAI varies in a value above 10% per linear meter, has a mean value of 10 m-1. As it can 338 
be seen, values observed in the Figure 6 are in line with the LAI mean value shown in Table 2 (5.9). It 339 
is not the case of the Standard Error, which was found to be very small in the manual measurements 340 
(0.17). 341 

4. Discussion 342 

A 2D LiDAR scanner was used to electronically obtain canopy parameters related to the canopy 343 
volume and density in a very difficult crop because of its structure. By looking at the general results 344 
in Table 2, LiDAR values for geometrical characteristics, such as height and width, differs on those 345 
obtained with manual measurements that where overestimated. This circumstance was also 346 
observed in previous works with this sensor [20, 40]. In the case of the plant height, it is related to the 347 
way of taking manual measurements, in which one operator stands with a topographic milestone 348 
and other, at a certain distance, must take the measurements by observing the top part of the plants. 349 
As this height is important (>2m) and the row spacing is narrow (2 - 2.8 m), the operator might have 350 
good skills in read the height value, reading instead its conical projection. In the case of the width, 351 
the most external points are taken and, therefore, the measured width for each section is not the 352 
mean, but the maximum. 353 

It is very noticeable the fact that mean LWA values for the three GHs are not coincident with the 354 
HM values, having the maximum mean value in GH3 rather than in GH2, which is the one with the 355 
highest mean HM value. At this point the row spacing has more weight on LWA calculation rather 356 
than the canopy height. The TRV values, on the other hand, presents similar behavior related to the 357 
height and width values variation. In this particular case, data obtained shows that  358 

 



Sensors 2016, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 4 

Due to the height of the canopy is constant (because the structure of the greenhouse) and the 359 
row spacing is also determined by the farmer and conditioned by the greenhouse structure, the only 360 
parameter that change is the canopy width. For this reason, in this particular case presented on this 361 
research, the TRV method seem to be more suitable to determine the amount of canopy instead of 362 
LWA, that is mainly affected by the row spacing.  363 

In tomato crop produced in greenhouses the evolution of the LAI is linked to the height of the 364 
plant until the plant reaches the top of the greenhouse structure, where the expression of the canopy 365 
increases through the width. In this sense, the TRV seems more suitable to describe the vegetation as 366 
a result of gives more information across the canopy width rather than LWA, where in this 367 
particular case, is most affected by row spacing than canopy height.  368 

n the case of estimating the canopy volumes, given by its TRV, it could be said that the LiDAR 369 
methodology is very accurate, for having high determination coefficients, especially when speaking 370 
about HL and VL. This fact was observed in other crops like vineyards [20], hedgerow fruit trees [46] 371 
and big-sized isolated trees, like citrus [47] or olive [40]. Spray application based on the canopy 372 
volume has shown to be accurate enough to be considered a first step in the process of the dose 373 
adjustment even for very complex canopy structures [11, 48], and it is in this point where lies the 374 
importance of having accurate estimating parameters that allow the farmers or technicians to have a 375 
very simple criterion to adjust the sprayed volumes, what can be easily done by performing a 376 
canopy volume map or by having a sensor operating real time and automatically adjusting the 377 
spraying parameters [49].  378 

As to the canopy density, its importance has been deeply suggested by different authors to 379 
modify the spray volume calculated with volume-based dosing methods [16, 18, 50]. This parameter 380 
can be automatically estimated with the LiDAR scanner, as shown by the significance of the 381 
correlations between LAI and HL and between LAI and VL. These results are in line with those found 382 
in other studies [51] and have a very important repercussion at the time of automatically adjusting 383 
the spray dose, as an estimation of the canopy density can be added to the volume estimator for a 384 
real-time adjustment of the spray dose, like other authors implemented in other crops [50, 52]. It was 385 
surprising for the research team that the LiDAR point number per row length unit was not 386 
correlated with canopy density. This fact can have an explanation in the paired planting system, that 387 
only allows the laser to scan one plant side and, therefore, did not allow the researchers to properly 388 
study the correlation between the LiDAR points and the individual plant’s LAD. In further studies, 389 
this parameter should be studied from a top perspective in addition to the normal side perspective 390 
to check the validity of this parameter. 391 

Speaking about the canopy variation along the row, the LiDAR scanner showed to be a strong 392 
methodology to properly characterize all the longitudinal variations in this parameter, and taking 393 
into account that it can vary 10 times per meter, as a mean value, manual methods could not afford 394 
to manage this high variability. In this sense, the research on mapping methodologies has been very 395 
important in last years [30] and further research is necessary to adapt these to the particular case of 396 
paired plantation systems in greenhouse tomato crops. The optimal spray volumes should be 397 
adjusted to the canopy volume and density as well to transform these volume or density maps in 398 
spray volume maps, in order to optimize the spray application process. 399 

Terrestrial 2D-LiDAR sensors can be the most appropriate alternative to characterize the 400 
canopy structure for the high accuracy at estimating the canopy volume and density and for their 401 
 



Sensors 2016, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 4 

longitudinal resolution, that makes possible have it as a tool to support decisions to adjust the liquid 402 
flow rate at a very specific level, allowing the farmers to have their plants protected in an optimum 403 
way by preserving them from unnecessary pesticide wastes that affect the environment and their 404 
production costs. 405 

 406 
5. Conclusions 407 
The canopy characterization with a terrestrial 2D LiDAR scanner was performed in a 408 

paired-plantation system in three greenhouse tomato crops and its accuracy was compared with 409 
manual characterization methods. The following conclusions can be drawn: 410 

• The LiDAR scanner measurements for the shape parameters of the canopy are highly 411 
correlated with the manual measurements. LiDAR generates a certain underestimation 412 
of manual values but it can be due to its higher accuracy and the manual methodology 413 
limitations. 414 

• Volume parameters, like TRV and LWA can be estimated with the laser scanner with a 415 
high statistical significance and high determination coefficients. This point is very 416 
important to fit to the new proposals towards dose harmonization according to these 417 
parameters in the European Union to ensure the best dose rate adjustments. 418 

• Leaf area index can be estimated by the sensor from the calculated height or volume, 419 
but not from the impact number per hedgerow length unit, as expected. Further 420 
improvements in the laser scanning process could improve this estimation. 421 

• Canopy variations along a single row are very important to determine the exact input 422 
needed in each part of the field and, therefore, manual methods could not fit for having 423 
a low longitudinal resolution. LiDAR scanners are able to adapt to this variability, 424 
being a very important alternative for the canopy density maps generation. 425
