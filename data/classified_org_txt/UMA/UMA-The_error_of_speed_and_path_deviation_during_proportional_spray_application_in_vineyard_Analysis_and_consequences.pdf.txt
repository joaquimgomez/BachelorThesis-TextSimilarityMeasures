Introduction 

 
Need to improve the quality on spray application process based on environmental, 
social and economic aspects have launched the use of new technologies in spray 
application in vineyard. In 2003 a new prototype for variable application rate in 
vineyard was developed (Gil et al., 2007; Llorens et al., 2010). The system allows 
to adjust the volume rate according canopy dimensions using ultrasonic sensors for 
determine the crop width and furthermore the tree row volume. Those measures 
were taken assuming a constant forward speed and a parallel path right in the 
middle of the row line. Possible errors in both parameters can affect considerably 
to the final result in canopy characterization. Those same problems and mistakes 
were observed and measured during the field test in citrus and vineyard (Zaman et 
al., 2007; Salyani and Wei, 2005) using ultrasonic sensors and LIDAR (Light 
Detection and Ranging). 
 
 

Methodology 
 
Variations on real forward speed and path direction of the tractor in the centre line 
have been measured by using a DGPS receiver placed on the tractor. An AgGPS 
332 model (Trimble) was installed on the top of the tractor cabin, using the 
differential correction supplied by EGNOS satellites system. A Compact Field Point 
for acquisition and data management has been also installed in the prototype, 
using Labview 8.5. Field tests have been carried out in Castell del Remei (Lleida) 
in two different wine varieties, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in spring and 
summer 2010. 
 
 

Results 
 
Obtained results indicate differences among theoretical and real forward speed, 
measured with DGPS (figure 1). Also differences between theoretical position of 
the tractor in the centre line and real path measured with DGPS have been 
quantified (figure 2). Those errors have been used to determine the difference 
between intended applied volume and real application, with interesting differences.

Once established the procedure and the methodology to determine the real values 
of forward speed and tractor position, the new development of the prototype will 
include those measurements to quantify the accurate volume according canopy 
characteristics.
