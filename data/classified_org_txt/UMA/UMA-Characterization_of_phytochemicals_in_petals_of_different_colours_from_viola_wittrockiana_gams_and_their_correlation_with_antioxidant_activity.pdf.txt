Abstract  

A study to establish relationship between the petal colour, extraction solvent, phenolic, flavonoid, anthocyanin 
content and antioxidant activity in three varieties of Viola × wittrockiana (yellow, red and violet) is reported in 
this article. Identification and quantification of flavonoids and anthocyanins using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS is also 
presented. The antioxidant activity was studied by four different analytical assays: the measurement of 
scavenging capacity against ABTS+ and DPPH free radicals, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and 
ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The violet petals were the most active in all solvents employed for 
extraction and also showed higher total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin content in comparison with red and 
yellow ones. Fourteen constituents were identified by HPLC coupled with diode-array detection (DAD) and 
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ten of them were flavonoids and four anthocyanins. The major compounds found 
in violet pansy were rutin, violanthin and violanin. Aqueous extract of violet pansy can be regarded as a suitable 
candidate to serve as a radical scavenging agent that could be used in functional foods. 

Keywords: Viola × wittrockiana extract, phenolic content, antioxidant activity, HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS 

1. Introduction 

The traditional use of flowers in food has been thoroughly documented. Several ancient world cultures used 
many species for medical uses and often incorporated them as part of their diet. In Spain the use of flowers in 
food was not very common until the end of the last century, when they were usually incorporated into dishes, 
mainly as ornamental elements. This popularity has encouraged their use as additives in food industry due to 
their well-known potential health benefits, in order to obtain new and attractive functional products 
(Sanchez-Mata et al., 2012). At that time, studies were performed in order to analyze the consumers' 
acceptability of flower petals as edible vegetables. Parameters influencing the consumers were analyzed and 
petal colour obtained the highest influence rate (between 63 and 95 %) (Kelley, Behe, Biernbaum, & Poff, 2001). 

Heartsease (Viola tricolor L.) is a well-known medicinal plant. Its biological activities are supposed to be related 
to its antioxidant capacity. Garden pansies (Viola × wittrockiana Gams) are common and long cultivated 
ornamental hybrid plants developed in the 19th century by crossbreeding Viola tricolor L. in order to produce 
more attractive flowers. The plants are known to produce petals of many possible colours. Vukics et al. (2008a) 
found that both, wild and garden pansies (V. tricolor and V. × wittrockiana) contained similar amounts of 
antioxidant substances. Attractive flowers and antioxidant capacity make garden pansy a suitable candidate to be 
used as a functional food product (Vukics, Kery, & Guttman, 2008). 

Violae are rich sources of phytochemical compounds which play important roles in plant metabolism, growth 
and reproduction, while some of them bring about protection against pathogens, predators and UV radiation. 
Some of these compounds, such as polyphenols, were shown to cause important nutritional and health benefits in 
humans (Kaisoon, Siriamornpun, Weerapreeyakul, & Meeso, 2011). From a nutritional standpoint, polyphenols 
exhibit a wide range of physiological properties, such as antiallergenic, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-thrombotic, cardioprotective and vasodilatory effects. They have also been 
linked to oxidative stress disease prevention in Alzheimer, Parkinson, atherosclerosis and various cancers (Feng 



www.ccsenet.org/jas Journal of Agricultural Science Vol. 6, No. 9; 2014

& Wang, 2012; Schiffrin, 2010). Studies have demonstrated that dietary polyphenols can act as scavengers of 
free radicals, inducing, inhibiting or modulating the signal of transduction of antioxidant enzymes or chelating 
metal ions (Han, Shen, & Lou, 2007). For a complete determination of phenolic content and antioxidant activity, 
quantitative and qualitative information is needed. Several studies analyzed Viola tricolor L. (Violaceae) extracts 
by TLC or HPLC combined with UV detection but results were not specific enough for the identification of 
flavonoid glycosides. For this reason Papp et al. (2004) examined ethanolic petal extracts by HPLC-DAD and 
on-line mass spectrometry (ESI-MS or APCI-MS) and five peaks were identified: quercitin, isoquercitin, 
hyperoside, rutin, and luteolin-7-O-β-glucoside (Papp et al., 2004). Vukics et al. (2008c) performed extraction of 
heartsease herb with chloroform (fraction A) and then with ethanol (fraction B) in an ultrasonic bath. According 
to their results, the two major pansy flavonoids were violanthin and rutin. In addition, the same authors stated 
that flowers of heartsease are a potential source of natural antioxidants and that this tissue showed higher 
antioxidant activity than the herb and leaves. Moreover, a significant correlation between the flavonoid content 
and antioxidant activity was found (Vukics et al., 2008b). The same authors made a comparative study of 
antioxidant capacity of garden pansies of three different flower colours and wild pansy (Vukics et al., 2008a). 
Previous papers had focused on the study of the antioxidant activity of herb and petals of wild and garden 
pansies but did not identify most of their flavonoids.  

The aim of this research was to investigate more deeply the composition of polyphenols, flavonoids and 
anthocyanins in flowers of Viola × wittrockiana and to establish relationships between the colour, the 
methodology of extraction, polyphenols, flavonoids, total anthocyanins and antiradical activity in vitro. 
Flavonoids and anthocyanins were investigated using HPLC coupled with diode-array detection (DAD) and 
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The differences between three petal colours (yellow, red and violet) using three 
extraction solvents (water, 50% ethanol and 50% ethanol in acid media) are reported. 

2. Material and Methods 

2.1 Chemicals and Reagents 

All the solvents employed, analytical and HPLC grades were purchased from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). 
Standards and reagents such as 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox®), gallic acid 
(GA) and rutin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company, Ltd. (Gillingham, UK). Vainillin was obtained 
from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Standards for HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analysis were purchased from 
Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France). All other chemicals were purchased from common sources. 

2.2 Plant Material and Preparation of Extracts 

Three petal colours of garden pansies (Viola × wittrockiana), belonging to violet family (Violaceae), were 
analysed: yellow, red and violet. Petals were grown in a greenhouse (Balaguer, Spain). Twelve different tissues 
of each variant of petal colours were manually collected, dried, and ground to a homogenous powder in January 
2012 in collaboration with the company Pàmies Hortícoles, S.L., comprising three replicates. The powder was 
stored protected from light and moisture until the extraction. 

Each variant of petal colour was treated with three types of solvent: water, 50% ethanol and 50% ethanol in acid 
media (hydrochloric acid was added to pH=1.5-2). The extracts were prepared according to the published 
procedure (Lopez et al., 2008). Futhermore, three different extractions were carried out for each petal colour in 
order to obtain representative quantitative results. For each extraction, 1.5 g of air-dried and homogenous powder 
of petals was macerated with 50 mL of each solvent. The mixture was stirred continuously for 24 h at 4 °C. After 
that, all samples were centrifuged (Sigma 6K10, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Part of the supernatant was 
introduced in a rotary evaporator until the complete evaporation of the organic solvent, frozen at -80 °C for 24 h 
and lyophilized for 3 days to provide the sample to be used in the assays. Samples were then weighed and kept 
protected from light in a dessicator until use. There were no differences in extraction yield among the different 
extracts. Values ranged between 15 and 20% for all extracts. 

2.3 Antioxidant Assessment 

2.3.1 Qualitative Determination on DPPH free Radical Scavenging Capacity by TLC 

100 µg of crude extracts were spotted on silica-gel 60 F254 plates (Merck, Germany) and were developed in ethyl 
acetate-glacial acetic acid-formic acid-water (100:11:11:26). Three plates were prepared under same conditions, 
one for the antiradical test and the others to establish a relation between the antioxidant activity and the nature of 
the active compounds (Wagner, 1996). 

The first plate was sprayed with a methanolic solution of DPPH (2 mg/mL). The second plate was sprayed with 
vanillin-sulphuric acid (observed at visible) as a general reagent and the third plate was sprayed with natural

products – PEG (view under 366 nm) to detect flavonoids. 

2.3.2 Quantitative Determination of Antioxidant Activity 

Four different methods were used for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the extracts: DPPH 
radical-scavenging assay (Lopez et al., 2008), 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS+) 
assay (Almajano, Carbo, Jimenez, & Gordon, 2008), Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay 
(Almajano, Delgado, & Gordon, 2007) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) method (Skowyra, 
Falguera, Gallego, Peiró, & Almajano, 2013). Results were expressed as mg Trolox (TE)/g of freeze-dried 
weight (FDW) extract. All measurements were performed with an automated microplate reader and 96-well 
plates using a spectrophotometer (Fluostar Omega, Perkin-Elmer, Paris, France). Absorbance measurements 
were made in triplicate for each diluted solution. 

2.3.2.1 DPPH Assay 

The DPPH assay determined the ability of extracts to scavenge the DPPH radical. A solution of DPPH (5.07 mM) 
in pure methanol was prepared. Appropriate dilutions were made for the study of the samples to allow the fall in 
DPPH concentration to be in the range 10-90 %. Then, the solution of DPPH and samples (in a concentration of 
10% v/v of sample and 90% of the radical) were added to the well of a microplate. Absorbance was measured at 
517 nm, every 15 min for 75 min.  

2.3.2.2 ABTS Assay 

The assay is based on the ability of an antioxidant compound to quench the ABTS+ relative to that of a reference 
antioxidant such as Trolox. A stock solution of ABTS+ radical cation was prepared by mixing ABTS solution 
with a potassium persulfate solution at 7 mM and 2.45 mM final concentration, respectively. The mixture was 
maintained in the dark at room temperature for 16 h before use. The working ABTS+ solution was produced by 
dilution in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) incubated at 30 °C of the stock solution to achieve an absorbance value of 0.7 
(±0.02) at 734 nm. An aliquot of 20 µL of diluted extract was added to ABTS+ working solution (180 µL). For 
the blank and standard curve, 20µL of PBS or Trolox solution were used, respectively. Absorbance was 
measured by means of a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Fluostar Omega, Perkin-Elmer, Paris, France) at 734 nm 
immediately after addition and rapid mixing (t0) and then every minute for 15 min. Readings at t = 0 min (t0) and 
t = 5 min (t5) of reaction were used to calculate the inhibition percentage value for each extract: % inhibition of 
the sample = [(t0 – t 5)/t0] × 100 – [% inihibition of the blank]. A standard reference curve was built by plotting % 
inhibition value against Trolox concentration (2–32µM).  

2.3.2.3 ORAC Assay 

Diluted extract (40 µL) was transferred by pipette into each well and then 120 µL of 1.34 µM fluorescein 
working solution in phosphate buffer (13.3 mM) at 37 °C were added to each sample. The plate was placed in a 
spectrophotometer and incubated at 37 °C. The initial fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 
485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. 2,2′-Azobis(2-metylpropionamide) dihydrochloride (AAPH, 40 
µL, 30 mM) was then added to each sample well and the fluorescence was measured immediately and every 2 
min thereafter for 120 min. For the calibration curve, solutions of Trolox were prepared in the range of 8–58 µM. 
The ORAC value for each extract was calculated using a regression equation relating Trolox concentration and 
the net area under the fluorescence decay curve.  

2.3.2.4 FRAP Assay 

The FRAP reagent was prepared with acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (10 mM in HCl, 40 mM) and 
FeCl3 (20 mM). The proportions were 10:1:1 (v:v:v), respectively. A suitable dilution of the extract was added to 
the FRAP reagent (1:30, v:v) and incubated at 37 °C. The assay was performed by means of an automated 
microplate reader (Fluostar Omega, Perkin-Elmer, Paris, France) with 96-well plates. The absorbance at 593 nm 
at time zero and after 4 min was recorded. The analysis was performed in triplicate and values were determined 
from a calibration curve of Trolox (ranging from 2.5 to 33 µM). 

2.4 Total Phenolic (TPC), Total Flavonoid (TFC) and Total Anthocyanin (TAC) Content 

To determine the TPC, an originally developed method and improved by Prior et al. was used (Prior, Wu, & 
Schaich, 2005). Finally, the optical density of the blue-coloured resulting solution was measured at 765 nm using 
a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Gallic acid calibration curve (2-14 mg/L) was used to 
determine TPC concentrations (y=0.076x-0.0175, r2=0.9989). Results are expressed as mg of gallic acid 
equivalents (GAE)/g of freeze-dried weight. 

TFC was determined using the method from German Pharmacopoeia. A known volume of sample reacted with

96 

AlCl3 20 mg/mL in 5% acetic acid in ethanol in 3:1 ratio. After 30 minutes absorbance was measured at 405 nm. 
The calibration curve was prepared with rutin (15-90 mg/L) and results are expressed as mg of rutin equivalents 
(RE)/g of freeze-dried weight (y=0.008x+0.0246, r2=0.9971). 

The quantification of TAC is based on the spectrophotometric measurement of absorbance at a specific 
wavelength, 520 nm. Malvidin 3-O-glucoside calibration curve (40-300 mg/L) was use to obtain final 
concentrations and data were expressed as mg of malvidin glucoside equivalents (ME)/g of freeze-dried weight 
(y=0.0031x–0.1511, r2=0.9676). 

2.5 HPLC Analysis 

Identification of all constituents was performed by HPLC-DAD and MS analysis by comparing the retention 
time, the UV and MS spectra of the peaks in the extracts. 

2.5.1 HPLC-DAD Analysis  

HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Germany). 
Compounds were separated on a C18 reversed-phase column (4.6×250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 
USA) and detected with a diode array detector (DAD). Injection volume was 10 µL and flow rate was 1 mL/min. 
Gradient elution was applied with 0.1% formic acid-acidified water (A) and 0.1% formic acid-acidified 
acetonitrile (B) as solvents. Gradient conditions were as follows: 0 min, 90% A; 4 min, 85% A; 20 min, 80% A; 
22 min, 10% A; 24 min, 90% A; 29 min, 90% A. The UV–vis spectra were recorded between 220 and 550 nm. 

2.5.2 HPLC-MS Analysis  

The HPLC system described above was interfaced with a HP1100 MSD API-electrospray detector (Agilent 
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The column and the chromatographic condition were the same as those used 
for the HPLC analysis. Mass spectrometry operating conditions were optimised in order to achieve maximum 
sensitivity values: negative and positive ionisation mode, scan spectra from m/z 100 to 1000, was used with a 
gas temperature of 350 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 10 L/min, nebulizer pressure 30 psi, quadrupole temperature 
30°C and capillary voltage 3.5 kV. The collision energy was 60 eV. 

2.5.3 Validation of HPLC Method and Quantitative Determination of Individual Constituents 

The HPLC method was validated in terms of linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ) 
precision, specificity, and accuracy according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
guidelines (Shabir, 2003).  

The quantitative determination of flavonoids and anthocyanins was performed using the external standard 
method and they were detected at 350 and 525 nm. The calibration curves were obtained with five samples of 
various concentrations by linear regression analysis. The equation of linear regression for flavonol derivatives 
was y=13.28x+3.20 (r2=0.997) and for anthocyanin derivatives was y=10.33x+2.53 (r2=0.998), using rutin and 
malvidin-3-O-glucoside as standards, respectively. Both detection limits were 0.1 g/mL. The repeatability and 
reproducibility of the chromatographic separations was verified with several columns, and all chromatographic 
analyses were reproducible on a second HPLC. Extracts were analysed three times and each extract obtained was 
injected three times into the HPLC. The amount of flavonoids and anthocyanins in each extract was expressed in 
mg per gram of dried petals. 

2.6 Statistical Analysis 

Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. All data were analyzed by the computer application SPSS 
for Windows (version 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Statistical differences were evaluated with one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett post hoc test. Differences at the level P<0.05 were considered to be 
significant. Correlations between total phenol contents, total flavonoid contents, total anthocyanin contents and 
antioxidant activity were established by regression analysis. 

3. Results and Discussion 

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) chemical screening is a simple, fast, and low-cost method of identification of 
chemical ingredients in plant extracts. In order to detect antioxidant activity in water, 50% ethanol and 50% 
ethanol in acid media extracts, a method based on the reduction of DPPH radical by TLC was carried out. The 
use of DPPH provides an easy and rapid way to evaluate antioxidant activity. DPPH is a free radical stable at 
room temperature, which produces a violet solution in methanol. In the DPPH free radical scavenging capacity 
assay by TLC, the extracts that produced yellow spots on the plates were considered to containantioxidant agents. 
Some plants are rich in secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic acids and tannins. In 
all the extracts assayed high antioxidant/antiradical capacities were detected. After studying the plates sprayed

97 

with vanillin/H2SO4 and Natural Products reagents PEG it was deduced that the activity might be due mainly to 
phenolic compounds, flavonoids and anthocyanins.  

A number of assays have been described in the literature for the measurement of total antioxidant activity of food, 
medicinal extracts and pure compounds (Dudonne, Vitrac, Coutiere, Woillez, & Merillon, 2009). Each method 
relates to the generation of a different radical, acting through a variety of mechanisms. In this sense, the 
antioxidant activity of different extracts was evaluated in four different in vitro models (Table 1). The four assays 
gave comparable results for the antioxidant activity measured in extracts. In general, violet petals were the most 
active with three types of solvent employed.  

Significant differences in the antioxidant activity of the extracts were detected depending on the extraction 
solvent. The 50% ethanol extract was the most active in the yellow and red petals (651.51 µg TE/g and 954.16 
µg TE/g, respectively) in DPPH assay. However, the better extraction solvent for violet petals was water 
(1026.65 µg TE/g). Similar results were revealed in ABTS, ORAC and FRAP assays (Table 1). There was a 
strong correlation between the values obtained with DPPH, ABTS ORAC and FRAP. Similarly, Ou et al. (2002) 
reported high correlation of antioxidant activity between the FRAP and ORAC techniques in blueberry fruit, and 
Awika et al. (2003) observed as well high correlation between ABTS, DPPH, and ORAC among sorghum and its 
products.  

TPC, TFC and TAC of all extracts showed solvent and pH dependence. Variations in the contents of various 
extracts were attributed to the polarities of the compounds present. The TPC values were in the range from 
120.56 mg GAE/g to 465.76 mg GAE/g. In all cases, the TPC content was higher when the extraction solvent 
was 50% ethanol, followed by 50% ethanol in acid media and water. The TPC values of the violet (465.76 mg 
GAE/g) and red (464.17 mg GAE/g) petals were similar and significantly higher than in the yellow (287.51 mg 
GAE/g) ones. Gallego et al. (2013) reported that TPC values for thyme and lavender flowers were 288 and 52 
mg GAE/g, respectively. These values are similar or lower than found in the current study. The good correlations 
between TPC and DPPH radical scavenging activity (r2=0.6727), ABTS+ radical scavenging activity 
(r2=0.8851), ORAC method (r2=0.9234) and FRAP assay (r2=0.7681) values confirmed that mainly the phenols 
were responsible for the antioxidant activity of the extracts. These results agreed with previous studies of edible 
and wild flowers from China like Rosa rugosa, Limonium sinuatum or Pelargonium hortorum (Li et al., 2014). 

TFC was also determined and values ranging from 28.20 mg RE/g to 198.57 mg RE/g were found. These results 
confirmed the previous literature reports indicating that flavonoids represent the main group of phenolic 
compounds in pansy (Vukics et al., 2008b). The highest TFC value was obtained using water as an extraction 
solvent in the three colours: yellow (55.91 mg RE/g), red (83.58 mg RE/g) and violet (198.57 mg RE/g), 
followed by 50% ethanol and 50% ethanol in acid media. The study also showed a high and positive correlation 
between TFC content and DPPH radical scavenging activity (r2=0.6136), ABTS+ radical scavenging activity 
(r2=0.84), ORAC method (r2=0.7941) and FRAP assay (r2=0.8342). 

Acidified media showed influence on the anthocyanin content and the extraction efficiency was higher at lower 
pH values. The higher TAC values were seen in violet (38.74 mg ME/g), followed by red (28.72 mg ME/g) and 
finally yellow (13.98 mg ME/g) petals. However, low correlations were found between total anthocyanin content 
and antioxidant activity. Therefore, good correlation (TFC and radical scavenging activity) suggested that 
phenolic compounds, mainly of flavonoid type, play an important role as antioxidants. Variations in the 
antioxidant capacity of different extracts may be attributed to differences in their individual phenolic contents. 

Significant advantages over other chromatographic techniques, such as the potential of being used for qualitative 
and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and specificity, have made HPLC-MS a widespread and extremely 
useful method for phytochemical analysis. This technique combines HPLC, a powerful tool for complex mixture 
separation, with mass spectrometry which enables a reliable determination of the molecular weight and 
characterization of ionised compounds.

Components of red, yellow and violet garden pansy, extracted with three different solvents were identified and 
quantified by comparing retention times, ultraviolet and mass spectra and mass fragmentation data with those 
described in existing literature. In total, 14 constituents were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS. In Figure 1, the 
HPLC-DAD chromatograms of the yellow, red and violet petals are presented. Data concerning the identification 
of the peaks are shown in Table 2, where the retention time, UV-Vis absorptions and electrospray ionisation mass 
spectrometry in negative and positive ion mode of all the compounds detected are reported.

HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS analyses evidenced the presence of 10 flavonoids (Table 2, Figure 1). Their UV spectra 
exhibited two major absorption maxima in the region of 240-400 nm. HPLC-MS and HPLC-UV data indicated 
the presence of complex flavonol and flavone glucosides. Compounds F1, F3, and F9 were derivatives of 
quercetin, whereas F5, F6, F7, F8 and F10 revealed the presence of apigenin. Fragmentation patterns of 



www.ccsenet.org/jas Journal of Agricultural Science Vol. 6, No. 9; 2014 

101 

compounds F2 and F4 suggested the presence of kaempferol and luteolin derivatives, respectively. 

 

 
Figure 2. Chemical structures of flavonoids identified from Viola × wittrockiana 

 

Molecular masses were higher than 400 Da and the characteristic ions of sugar losses (146 Da and 162 Da for 
deoxyhexose and hexose units, respectively) indicated the presence of one or more sugar units in their structure. 

The high retention times of 15.2, 17.8, 23.0 and 25.6 min of less polar compounds F7, F8, F9 and F10 in 
combination with their mass data and literature references indicated the presence of one sugar unit. The MS 
spectra of peaks F9 and F10 showed the lack of the fragment ions characteristic of sugar losses (162 Da) for 
glucose units, which suggested that both compounds were flavonoid O-glucosides. Similarly, compounds F7 and 
F8 are flavonoid C-glucosides [M-H-178]-. These results suggested the identity of the compounds as orientin 
(F7), isoorientin (F8), isoquercitrin (F9) and apigetrin (F10), which is compatible  with literature references for 
Viola × wittrockiana and other species of Viola (Karioti, Furlan, Vincieri, & Bilia, 2011; Papp et al., 2004). 

Fragmentation patterns for compounds F3, F4, F5 and F6 showed the presence of a second sugar. Compound F3 
was identified, based on the presence of molecular ion at m/z 610 [M]+ in MS spectra, UV spectra and several 
literature references  (Karioti et al., 2011; Papp et al., 2004; Vukics et al., 2008b, 2008c) as rutin, compound F5 
as violanthin and compound F6 as vicenin-2. 

Compound F4 was identified as luteolin-6-C-rhamnosyl-8-C-glucoside. The structural elucidation was 
determined first of all on the basis of the UV spectra (λmax=255.6, 352.9 nm). Furthermore, the MS spectrum 
(m/z 626 [M]+, 625 [M-H]−, 463 [M-H-Glu]−, 447 [M-H-Rha]−, 285 [A-H]−) was similar to that of the compound 
F5. The difference of 16 u in the molecular ion was assigned to one additional hydroxyl group at C3´ of the ring 
B of the flavonoid. Since this constituent was observed for the first time in Viola sp., it would be necessary to 
characterize it completely by 1D and NMR spectroscopy after isolation and purification. 

On the other hand, compounds F1 and F2, at earlier retention times (5.6 and 8.1 min), displayed molecular ions 
at m/z 756 and 740 respectively, due to the presence of a third sugar. Compound F1 was identified as 
quercetin-3-O-rhamnorhamnoglucoside and compound F2 as kaempferol-3-O-rhamnorhamnoglucoside, based 
on the data obtained from the literature from V. odorata (Karioti et al., 2011).

The red and violet petals indicated the presence of anthocyanins, which are glycosides and acylglycolides of 
anthocyanidins, according to the hydroxyl or methoxyl substitutions in the basic skeleton. In this type of 
compounds, acid media are generally preferred in HPLC analyses, as they enhance anthocyanin stabilisation. In 
this case, the possible presence of labile flavonoids with more than two saccharides, as well as the fact that under 
acid conditions hydrolysis of labile acyl groups may occur, did not permit to conduct the analyses in pH lower 
than 2.5. 

Four anthocyanins (A1, A2, A3 and A4) were tentatively identified by comparing retention time, MS and UV-vis 
spectrum (Figure 2). All of them showed a typical chromatogram of the anthocyanins with selective wavelength 
(500–550nm absorption). The chromatographic and spectral data are summarised in Table 2. These 
identifications were confirmed by the scientific literature (Karioti et al., 2011). 

 

 
Figure 3. Chemical structures of anthocyanins identified from Viola × wittrockiana 

 

Anthocyanins derived from aglycones cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin were identified, according 
to the presence of a series of fragment signals at m/z 287, 303, 317 and 331 in MS spectra, respectively. The 
shoulder absorption at 290-340 nm showed that compounds were acylated with aromatic acids (Wrolstad, Durst, 
& Lee, 2005). 

Violanin (A1) was assigned to a peak with retention time of 6.1 min and showed a characteristic 
pseudomolecular ion in the positive ion mode at m/z 919 and a peak at m/z 303 (corresponding to the delphinidin 
aglycone). UV maximum was at 312 nm due to the presence of the coumaroyl moiety. Other characteristic ions 
at m/z 757 [M-162]−, m/z 465 [M-308-146]−, were observed and attributed to the loss of coumaroyl and 
coumaroyl–rutinosyl moieties. 

Peaks A2, A3 and A4 had similar mass spectra patterns as A1. Based on their retention times and literature 
references, they were identified as petunidin-3-(4´´-p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside (tR=8.0 min), 
cyanidin-3-(4´´-p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside (tR=8.4 min) and 
malvidin-3-(4´´-p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside (tR=10.7 min), respectively. Several anthocyanins were 
detected at earlier times but the content was very low and their identification was impossible. 

In Table 1, the results of the quantitative analyses are reported. Concerning flavonoids, rutin (F3), violanthin 
(F5), vicen-2 (F6) and orientin (F7) were presented in all extracts. The major flavonoid found was F3 
(107.96±4.36 mg/g), followed by F5 (32.34±2.45 mg/g) in aqueous extract of violet petals. The same results had 
been presented by Vukics et al. (2008c). Moreover, Goncalves et al. (2012) reported a similar content of rutin in 
Viola tricolor flowers in ethyl acetated and butanol fractions (33.70 and 143.57 mg/g, respectively). 

Luteolin-6-C-rhamnosyl-8-C-glucoside (F4) was detected only in violet pansy. The content was 4-6-fold higher 
in aqueous (37.66±1.88 mg/g) than 50% ethanol (6.76±0.42 mg/g) or 50% ethanol in media acid (8.80±0.61 
mg/g) extract. In the same way, kaempferol-3-O-di-rhamnosyl-glucoside (F2), isoorientin (F8), isoquercetrin (F9) 



www.ccsenet.org/jas Journal of Agricultural Science Vol. 6, No. 9; 2014 

103 

and apigetrin (F10) appeared only in red pansy. The good correlation found between quercetin and luteolin 
derivatives (F1, F3, F4, F9) and antioxidant activity assays (r2>0.9) suggests that these compounds may be 
partly responsible for this activity. This confirms the importance of the presence of hydroxyl groups in ortho 
position in relation to this activity, which has previously been described by numerous authors (Casado et al., 
2011). 

The four previously identified anthocyanins (A1, A2, A3, A4) were detected and quantified in all extracts 
analyzed, with the exception of malvidin-3-(4´´-p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside (A4), which could not be 
quantified in water and 50% ethanol extract of yellow pansy (Table 1). 

In all extracts anthocyanin content was pH dependent, and therefore the best results were obtained when the 
solvent for extraction was 50% ethanol in acid media. 

Violanin (A1) was the major anthocyanin in the three different coloured petals, highlighting its high content in 
red (11.40 mg/g) and violet (11.58 mg/g) in comparison with yellow (4.69 mg/g) petals. The good correlation 
found between violanin (A1) and antioxidant activity assays (r2=0.877) suggests that this compound was also 
involved in the antioxidant activity. Delphinidin derivates were reported to have relatively strong antiradical 
activity among various anthocyanins (Kahkonen & Heinonen, 2003). 

Anthocyanins are a class of compounds responsible for red, blue and violet colours of plants. However, this class 
of compounds is highly unstable and easily susceptible to degradation. The stability of anthocyanin colour can be 
improved by copigmentation, where the anthocyanin molecule reacts with other natural plant components 
directly or through weak interactions, resulting in an enhanced and stabilized colour (Di Meo, Sancho Garcia, 
Dangles, & Trouillas, 2012, Deng et al., 2013). A wide range of different molecules has been found to act as 
copigments. The most studied group of copigments is flavonoids, of which flavones, flavonols, flavanones, and 
flavanols have been under profound examination. Several complex formations (Figure 3) through intermolecular 
interactions between delphinidin derivatives and quercetin derivatives have been described (Osawa, 1982). 

 

 
Figure 4. ortho-dihydroxyphenil moiety and complex formations through intermolecular interactions between 

delphinidin and quercetin 

 

Therefore, this copigmentation phenomenon could demonstrate the high antioxidant activity detected in aqueous 
extract of violet pansy, taking into consideration several factors, such as: i) high content in rutin and violanin 
(quercetin and delphinidin derivatives, respectively), ii) the ortho-dihydroxyphenil moiety in both types of 
compounds, iii) complex between anthocyanins and flavonoids, which are soluble in water solution. 

4. Conclusion 

This study has proved the antioxidant activity of extracts from pansy. The extracted amount of phenolics, 
flavonoids and anthocyanins, as well as their antioxidant activity, depends on both the extraction solvent and 
petal colour. In this way, the use of a solution of ethanol 50% results in the highest quantity of phenolics. The 
phenolic content in violet and red petals was similar and significantly higher than in yellow petals. Flavonoids 
represented the main group of phenolic compounds in pansy. The flavonoid content of violet petals was 
significantly higher than that of red and yellow material. Acidified media showed influence in anthocyanin 
content and the extraction was more efficient at lower pH values. Chromatographic analysis with UV spectra 
recorded on-line gave useful complementary information and HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS)

provided additional structural information aboutthe potentially active metabolites. In total, 14 constituents were 
identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS, 10 of them were flavonoids (quercetin and apigenin derivatives, mainly) and 
4 anthocyanins. Concerning flavonoids, rutin, violanthin, vicen-2 and orientin were presented in all extracts. The 
major flavonoid found was rutin, followed by violanthin in aqueous extract of violet petals. Violanin (delphinidin 
glucoside) was the major anthocyanin in the three pansy colours, with the highest values measured in red and 
violet petals. In conclusion, the copigmentation phenomenon between violanin and rutin evidences the high 
antioxidant activity detected in aqueous extract of violet pansy. Our results indicate that aqueous extracts of 
violet pansy can be used in functional foods as potential radical scavenging agents.
