Abstract: Gentiana Lutea root (G. Lutea) is a medicinal herb, traditionally used as a bitter 

tonic in gastrointestinal ailments for improving the digestive system. The active principles 

of G. Lutea were found to be secoiridoid bitter compounds as well as many other active 

compounds causing the pharmacological effects. No study to date has yet determined the 

potential of G. Lutea antioxidant activity on lipid oxidation. Thus, the aim of this study was 

to evaluate the effects of an extract of G. Lutea on lipid oxidation during storage of an 

emulsion. G. Lutea extracts showed excellent antioxidant activity measured by DPPH 

scavenging assay and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. An amount 

of 0.5% w/w G. Lutea lyophilise was able to inhibit lipid oxidation throughout storage  

(p < 0.05). A mixture of G. Lutea with 0.1% (w/w) BSA showed a good synergic effect and 

better antioxidant activity in the emulsion. Quantitative results of HPLC showed that  

G. Lutea contained secoiridoid-glycosides (gentiopiocroside and sweroside) and post 

column analysis displayed radical scavenging activity of G. Lutea extract towards the 

ABTS radical. The results from this study highlight the potential of G. Lutea as a food 

ingredient in the design of healthier food commodities.

1. Introduction 

Gentian Lutea root (G. Lutea), also known as Yellow Gentian, has over 300 species and is widely 

distributed in North America, Europe, Asia and some parts of South America [1]. The plant root was 

traditionally use as a medicinal plant to stimulate appetite and improve digestion [2]. Furthermore, the root 

is also well known for its bitter properties due to the existence of secoiridoid-glycosides (e.g., 

swertiamarin, gentiopicroside, amarogentin and sweroside) [3]. Many researchers have discovered the 

benefits of bitter tasting secoiridoid-glycoside through extensive pharmacological studies. These 

constituents are claimed to have many biological effects such as anti-apoptotic [4], anti-cancer [5],  

anti-fungi [6], anti-bacterial [7], anti-inflammatory [8], and hepatoprotective [9]. It has been reported 

recently by Nastasijevic et al. [10] that the G. Lutea extracts have potential to inhibit myeloperoxidase 

(MPO) activity which contributes to many disorders such as cardiovascular, inflammatory, 

neurodegenerative and immune-mediated diseases. 

However, not only are the secoiridoids relevant for the plant pharmacological action, there are many 

active compounds in G. Lutea that also have relevant effects such as iridoidloganic acid, xanthone 

(e.g., gentisin and isogentisin) and xanthone glycosides (gentioside and its isomer) [3]. Iridoidloganic 

acid has shown potent activity as an anti-inflammatory and a number of studies demonstrated that 

xanthones and its derivatives have wide-ranging biological activities such as anti-inflammatory,  

anti-hepatotoxic, anti-tumor and anti-microbial [11]. Furthermore, xanthone, and its derivatives, are 

phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties which have attracted much attention recently [12]. 

There are few reports that have investigated the radical scavenging activities of secoiridoid-glycosides 

using DPPH assay [7,13], although some authors have measured total antioxidant capacity of G. Lutea 

but without sufficient assessment of individual antioxidants [10,14]. However, the observation of 

antioxidant activity of G. Lutea extract towards lipid oxidation has not been fully determined. 

Lipid oxidation in high fat-containing food is a major cause of shelf life deterioration such as in 

meat products and emulsions. The oxidation process causes unsavoury alteration of flavor, texture, 

shelf life, appearance, and nutritional qualities [15]. 

Oil-in-water emulsion (o/w), is a food model which is highly susceptible to oxidation, besides it has 

also become one of the effective models to evaluate the antioxidant activity of natural plants towards 

lipids [16]. The first phase of lipid oxidation starts with the formation of unstable free radicals and 

hydroperoxides with further decomposition to secondary products like ketones, aldehydes, alcohols 

and acids [17]. The formation of peroxides in primary oxidation can be measured using peroxide value 

(PV) assay. Secondary oxidation can be measured by thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS), 

specifically aldehydes, and also leads to unpleasant taste, aroma and quality traits of the products. 

Thus, our goal was to evaluate the potential antioxidant activity of G. Lutea by different methods  

(1) in vitro with such radicals as ABTS
•+

, DPPH and enzymatic activity and (2) in o/w emulsion.

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Plant Material 

Commercially dried G. Lutea was kindly supplied by Manatial de la Salut (Barcelona, Spain),  

a registered herbal company. Reagents used were: thiobarbituric acid, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 

(DPPH), Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, methanol, hydrogen chloride, aluminium oxide, ferrous chloride, 

anhydrous sodium carbonate, ethanol 96%, Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) and ammonium 

thiocyanate from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). Gallic acid, 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-

sulfonic acid diammonium salt (ABTS), (±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2–carboxylic 

acid (Trolox), NBT (nitrobluetetrazolium), Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), Xanthine and  

Xanthine-oxidase from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). 

2.2. Extraction of G. Lutea 

Dried roots of G. Lutea were finely ground using a standard kitchen food processor. Ground  

G. Lutea (5 g) was extracted in two ways; (1) with 50:50 (v/v) methanol:water and (2) with water, 

always in the ratio 1:10 (w/v). The extraction was performed at 4 ± 1 °C for 24 h, in the dark with 

constant stirring. The extract solutions of G. Lutea were recovered by filtration using Whatman Filter  

paper, 0.45 μm. Part of the supernatant was taken for subsequent use to determine the antiradical 

capacity. The volume of the remaining supernatant was measured and the excess methanol was 

removed under vacuum using a rotary evaporator (BUCHI RE111, Postfachi, Switzerland) and kept 

frozen at −80 °C for 24 h. All extracts were dried in a freeze dryer (Unicryo MC2L −60 °C, 

Martinsried, Germany) under vacuum conditions at −60 °C for 3 days to remove moisture. Finally, G. 

Lutea lyophilize (freeze dried) were weighed to determine the concentration recovered (g/L) and the 

extraction yield (%) as Zhang et al. [18]. Samples were then weighed and kept protected from light in 

a desiccator until use. 

2.3. Determination of the Total Phenolic Content (TPC) 

The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenolic content (TPC) as reported by 

Santas et al. [19]. The sample was diluted 1:25 (v/v) in order to be in the range of absorbance. The 

final concentration (v/v) for the mixture was; sample 7.7%, Folin reagent 4% and saturated sodium 

carbonate solution 30.8%. The mixture was finally diluted with Mili Q water, shaken and incubated in 

the dark for 1 h. Absorbance at 765 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Fluostar Omega, 

BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) against water as a blank. Gallic acid was used to prepare a 

standard calibration, and the results were expressed as mg of Gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight  

(mg GAE/g DW).

2.4. Determination of Free Radical Scavenging Activity Assays 

2.4.1. TEAC Assay 

The antioxidant capacities of G. Lutea were measured by using a modified TEAC assay, which was 

performed as described by Miller et al. [20]. The TEAC assay was based on the reduction of the 

ABTS
•+ 

radical cation by the antioxidants present in the samples. ABTS
•+

 radical cation (7 mM, final 

concentration) was dissolved before adding potassium sulphate (2.45 mM, final concentration) and 

allowing the mixture to stand in the dark up to 16 h. Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS, 10 mM) with the 

ABTS
•+

 radical cation was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before used. Then, the mixture of 

the ABTS
•+

 radical cation was adjusted to an absorbance of 0.73 ± 0.2 nm, using a microplate reader 

(Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The TEAC values for the different 

concentrations of each compound were interpolated from the trolox calibration curve and expressed as 

milligrams of trolox equivalent per gram of dry weight sample (mg TE/g DW sample). 

2.4.2. DPPH Assay 

The effect of the extracts on the scavenging of DPPH radical was determined according to the 

method adapted from Madhujith et al. [21] with slight modifications. The sample was diluted 1:20 

(v/v) and DPPH radical in methanol (5.07 mM) was made for the study. Then, the sample (10% v/v) 

and DPPH solution (90% v/v) were added to the well of the microplate. The absorbance was measured 

at 517 nm over every 15 min for 75 min. The results were expressed as mg TE/g DW sample. 

2.4.3. Superoxide Activity Xanthine/Xanthine Oxidase (X/XO) 

The method was based on the developed method of Valentao et al. [22] and modified for  

application in microplates by Lopez et al. [23]. All test samples were dissolved in a 50 mM phosphate 

buffer to simulate the environment in which the reaction occurs in the body. The sample was mixed 

with 145 μM of a solution of xanthine, 50 μM of a solution of NBT and incubated in 37 °C. The 

sample extract was diluted from 1:10 to 1:100 (v/v) for the study. Finally, 0.29 U/mL of enzyme 

xanthine oxidase solution was added and the absorbance was recorded at 560 nm every 2 min. The 

value of IC50 was calculated to determine the inhibition rate of G. Lutea in the reaction. 

2.5. Determination of Antioxidant Activity in o/w Emulsion 

2.5.1. Removal of Tocopherols from Sunflower Oil 

Alumina was placed in an oven at 200 °C for 24 h, and then removed and allowed to cool in a 

desiccator until it reached room temperature. Sunflower oil triacylglycerol was passed twice through 

the alumina in a column to remove the tocopherols as described by Yoshida et al. [24]. Finally, the 

filtered oil was stored at −80 °C until use.

2.5.2. Preparation of Emulsion 

Oil in water emulsion was prepared by dissolving Tween-20 (1%, final concentration) in Milli Q 

water and adding oil (10%, final concentration). To form an emulsion, the oil was added drop wise to 

the solution of Tween-20 and water, which was kept cold, and sonication process was continued  

for 5 min. All samples were redissolved in ethanol-50% (v/v) to obtain the final concentration in the 

emulsion. The final samples were prepared either (i) control (no addition); (ii) 0.35% (w/w) Trolox 

(positive control); (iii) 0.1% (w/w) BSA; (iv) 0.5% (w/w) lyophilise G. Lutea; (v) 0.5% (w/w) 

lyophilise G. Lutea mixed with 0.1% (w/w) BSA; (vi) 0.2% (w/w) lyophilise G. Lutea and (vii) 0.2% 

(w/w) lyophilise G. Lutea mixed with 0.1% (w/w) BSA. The emulsion for each sample was prepared 

in quadruplicate, obtaining a total of 28 samples and stored in the dark and allowed to oxidize at 37 °C. 

The pH of the samples was measured four times for each sample (pH meter GLP21, Crison 

Instruments, Barcelona, Spain) as a parameter to investigate its correlation with PV. 

2.5.3. Determination of Peroxide Value (PV) 

The primary oxidation products were measured using peroxide value (PV) according to the 

thiocyanate method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) 8195 [25]. Ferrous 

chloride solution was prepared in hydrochloric acid (1 M) with the addition of iron chloride (II)  

(2 mM, final concentration). Ammonium thiocyanate solution was prepared in water (2 mM, final 

concentration). The assay was performed with a drop of emulsion in the range from 0.007 to 0.01 g, 

diluted with ethanol. From this solution the required amount of sample, varying according to the 

degree of oxidation, was taken in a cuvette and ethanol (96%) was added. Ferrous chloride and 

ammonium thiocyanate solutions were added, each in a proportion of 1.875% (v/v), final 

concentration. The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at λ = 500 nm. The results are 

expressed as meq hydroperoxides/kg of emulsion. 

2.5.4. Determination of Secondary Oxidation by Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) 

The TBARS method was adapted from Gallego et al. [26]. The TBARS reagent was prepared  

(15% w/v trichloroacetic acid, 0.375% w/v thiobarbituric acid and hydrochloric acid 2.1% v/v). One 

mL of each emulsion was taken and the TBARS reagent was added in the ratio 1:5 (v/v). Immediately 

the samples were added to an ultrasonic bath (5 min) and after immersing in a water bath preheated to 

95 °C (20 min) the samples were centrifuged and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at  

λ= 531 nm. The results are expressed as mg malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg of emulsion. 

2.6. Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance ANOVA using Minitab 16 

software program (Minitab, Inc., Paris, France). When a statistically significant difference was found, 

Tukey’s tests were performed and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The results were 

presented as mean values (n ≥ 3).

2.7. HPLC and Post-Column HPLC-ABTS
•+ 

Radical Scavenging Method 

The method for identification of peaks with antioxidant activity was that used by Koleva et al. [27] 

with some modifications. The instrument was a Waters 2695 separations module (Meadows 

Instrumentation Inc., Bristol, USA) system with a photodiode array detector Waters 996 (Meadows 

Instrumentation Inc., Bristol, USA). The column used was a Kinetex C18 100A, (100 × 4.6 mm, 

Phenomenex, Torrence, CA, USA). Solvents used for separation were 0.1% acetic acid in water (v/v)  

(eluent A) and 0.1% acetic acid in methanol (v/v) (eluent B). The gradient used was isocratic, 75% A. 

The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min. Detection wavelength was 230 nm (to see the peaks) and 734 nm  

(to see the ABTS radical). The sample injection volume was 10 μL. The chromatographic peaks of 

gentiopicroside and sweroside were confirmed by comparing their retention times and diode array 

spectra with that of their reference standards. The pump for ABTS post-column injection was a  

Merk-Hitachi HPLC gradient pump (Model L-6200, Hitachi High Technologies America Inc., 

Schaumburg, Illinois, IL, USA) with a 0.2 mL/min flow; ABTS concentration was of 0.03% (w/v). 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Analysis of Total Polyphenols and Free Radical Activity Assays 

On average, from 5 g of dried G. Lutea extracted with aqueous methanol 50:50 (v/v) and water 

alone, it was possible to recover 1.5 ± 0.05 g and 1.0 ± 0.04 g of lyophilised, respectively. The 

concentration recovered was proportional to the extraction yield shown in Table 1. Previous studies 

reported that gentiopicroside compound, an active compound that signifies the main bitter principle in 

G. Lutea was still preserved at almost 83.5% after drying [28].

The concentration of total polyphenols and the value of antioxidant activity assays were determined 

and the results are shown in Table 1. The extract of G. Lutea in methanol-50% showed higher phenolic 

content and antioxidant activity than the water extract. The total phenolic content of G. Lutea extracts 

allowed the estimation of all phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, nonflavonoids and many classes 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 461 

 

 

of polyphenol compounds present in the samples. On the other hand, Nastasijevic et al. determined the 

total polyphenol content of G. Luteain in water extract as being slightly higher compared to different 

concentrations of aqueous ethanol and methanol extracts [10]. 

Water extracts of G. Lutea showed the lowest activity in free DPPH
•
 scavenging activity compared 

to methanol-50% extract, similar to previous research from Kintzios et al. [14]. It is not the first time 

that the antioxidant activity of G. Lutea by DPPH method has been carried out. However, variation in 

results may be due to the plant age, solvent, method and system used throughout the  

experiment [10,14,29]. 

For the TEAC assay, the finding was consistent with the DPPH method where the aqueous 

methanol extract showed higher activity than the water extract. TEAC assay indicated the extract 

potency used as a source of antioxidants based on the ability of the antioxidant compound to scavenge 

the long-life radical cation ABTS
•+

. In the results shown in Table 1 it can be appreciated that the 

methanol-50% extract has a higher capacity to scavenge ABTS
•+

 radicals and consequently shows a 

higher antioxidant activity than DPPH assay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 

the antioxidant activity of extracts from G. Lutea roots assessed using the TEAC methods. 

Some of the previous reports showed that the antioxidant activity of plant extracts correlates with 

the phenolic content [30] and the yield of phenolic components from herbs is higher with  

methanol-50% rather than with water as extract. The mixtures of alcohol and water have been more 

efficient in extracting compounds and give a better yield than the corresponding mono-component 

solvent system. Xanthones such as isogentisin and gentisin and its derivatives are one of main sources 

of phenolic compounds in G. Lutea and are expected to be more soluble in aqueous alcohol. A study 

showed good correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity [31] whereas another found 

no correlation [32]. 

In the present work, an effective antioxidant activity in G. Lutea was found. Methanol-50%  

extract exhibited O2
•−

 scavenging activity, measured using the X/XO system (Table 1), with an IC50  

at 23.21 ± 2.8 mg/mL. Water extract of G. Lutea showed lower scavenging activity than methanol 

aqueous extract, with IC50 = 30.00 ± 2.8 mg/mL. These results are consistent with Kusar et al. [29], 

who demonstrated the effect of superoxide activity of G. Lutea leaf and root in methanol extracts, with 

IC50 inhibition value of 11.1 mg/mL and 8.2 mg/mL, respectively. Kusar and co-workers’ findings 

were accomplished by X/XO reaction mixture with DEPMO-OOH scavenger that transformed the 

reaction to a stable radical measured by electro spin resonance (ESR). Valentao et al. [22] observed the 

phenolic acids (p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid and kaempferol) exhibited superoxide 

scavenger activity and an inhibitory effect on XO. Considering the results obtained from TPC assay, it 

may be anticipated that G. Lutea extract has antioxidant activity achieved by the scavenging of 

superoxide radical and XO inhibition. 

3.2. Antioxidant Effect in Stored o/w Emulsion 

Many strategies on laboratory scale have been developed to improve the stability of shelf life in 

food models including adding a minimum amount of natural plants to delay the oxidation rate. The 

effect of G. Lutea on inhibiting lipid oxidation in oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion as a food model has not 

been described. In this study it also has been carried out to determine the synergic effect of G. Lutea 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 462 

 

 

with BSA in o/w emulsions. The oxidation in o/w emulsions was measured in two stages of oxidation; 

primary oxidation product (Peroxide Value) and secondary oxidation products (TBARS). In addition 

the change in pH was monitored, since pH tends to fall during oxidation. 

3.2.1. Evolution of Peroxide Value (PV) 

Figure 1 shows the evolution of PV vs. time. The control (without extract added) showed the 

highest oxidation throughout the storage time followed by the emulsion with only BSA (0.1%). The 

sample containing Trolox (0.35%, positive control) and the samples containing extracts, were not 

oxidized during the first 10 days. They show significant difference from the control (p < 0.05). The 

time required for the emulsions to reach a peroxide value of 10 meq hydroperoxides/kg of emulsion 

was determined as a standard to measure the stability of emulsion. The limits of fat product (animal, 

plant and anhydrous) margarine and fat preparation were set <10 meq hydroperoxides/kg as a guarantee 

of the product quality [33]. When the peroxide value of the sample is measured as greater than  

15 meq hydroperoxide/kg, the sample is considered rancid, which may alter the color, taste and 

nutritional quality due to the deterioration of the lipid. The control was the first sample to reach  

10 meq hydroperoxides/kg of emulsion which occurred rapidly in two days. The emulsion with BSA 

exhibited a similar deterioration rate to the control, revealing that BSA, in this concentration of 0.1%, 

does not provide any antioxidant effect in the emulsions. Positive control samples (Trolox) showed 

good antioxidant effect over 11 days and begin to oxidize rapidly after 15 days, reaching  

88 meq hydroperoxides/kg emulsion on the final days of the experiment. 

Figure 1. Change of peroxide value over time stored at 37 °C (each value is expressed as 

mean (n = 3)). 

 

Adding 0.2% G. Lutea to the emulsion, with or without adding BSA, did not result in any relevant 

effect towards oxidation in the first stage (PV <10 meq hydroperoxides/kgin time <3 days). There is a 

significant difference between 0.2% antioxidant sample with BSA and in its absence (p < 0.05). The 

sample with 0.5% G. Lutea showed antioxidant activity towards lipid degradation first at 15 days and 

gradually oxidized after 15 days (p < 0.05). Finally, the sample with G. Lutea 0.5% and BSA 0.1% 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 463 

 

 

displayed the lowest PV, with significant differences with the other samples throughout storage time  

(p < 0.05); it took almost 10 days to reach above 10 meq hydroperoxides/kg of emulsion. 

Almajano et al. [34] reported that some antioxidant compounds such as EGCG and caffeic acid 

mixed with BSA cause a marked increase of the antioxidant activity in an emulsion. Since BSA is 

known to be surface active [35], the increase of antioxidant activity in emulsions containing a mixture 

of antioxidant and BSA could be due to BSA binding with the antioxidant and transporting it to the oil 

water interface, where it is highly effective in reducing the rate of oxidation. The authors also stated 

that the antioxidant molecule had bound to the BSA protein, proved by TEAC assay, and showed a 

progressive increase in the radical scavenging ABTS
•+

 with the storage time over several days [34]. 

The mixture of 0.1% BSA and 0.5% G. Lutea in emulsion exhibit the lowest oxidation rate compared 

to all samples shown in this experiment. These results showed for the first time the important effect of 

G. Lutea extract on lipid oxidation with synergic effect to BSA tested in an o/w emulsion. This 

concentration of 0.5%, demonstrated the best antioxidant effect throughout the storage period. 

3.2.2. Evolution of pH over Time 

Since decomposition of hydroperoxide measured in PV assay is acidic, the pH change in the sample 

is considered inversely proportional to the PV. Thus, the pH measured is a parameter of which its 

correlation with PV can be investigated. Antioxidant activity in food models is less effective under low 

pH conditions. However, some antioxidant compounds such as carnosic acid and carnosol (found in 

rosemary) have been reported to have high antioxidant activity at lower pH, which is at pH 4–5 [36]. 

Figure 2 shows the changes of pH value on emulsions over 23 days storage. Overall, the decrease in 

pH value throughout storage was of a similar order with increased primary oxidation measured in the 

PV assay. These results agreed with the studies done by Frankel et al. [16]. They found that the lipid 

oxidation in emulsion is slower at higher pH, and decreased when oxidation is accelerated. All samples 

started nearly at neutral pH and 0.5% G. Lutea with 0.1% BSA showed the highest value throughout 

storage. Similar to PV, the pH of the sample with 0.2% G. Lutea with or without BSA showed higher 

pH than control but the value was not significant throughout storage (p > 0.05). The pH of  

0.5% G. Lutea with BSA and 0.5% G. Lutea alone, showed significant differences compared to all 

samples during storage period (p < 0.05). The behavior of pH of the sample with 0.5% G. Lutea with 

BSA was stable until 19 days before it started to decrease. 

Skowyra et al. [37] demonstrated that the pH and PV have the best correlation with R
2
 = 0.9648. 

Our results are in agreement with them and it can be described that the antioxidant activity in o/w 

emulsion which is stable at pH 6 showed an inverse relationship at a lower PV value. Some authors 

also reported a similar agreement of pH change which was inversely proportional to the lipid  

oxidation [26,38,39]. Meanwhile, Mancuso et al. [40,41] suggested the initial oxidation of emulsion 

depended on pH, by varying the effect of emulsifier. The authors observed a higher oxidation rate 

occurring at pH 7 rather than pH 3 o/w emulsion. Results may be due to the iron solubility increasing 

at low pH and allowing iron to be partitioned into the continuous phase, whereas insoluble iron at high 

pH may precipitate onto the emulsion droplet surface resulting in an increase in the lipid oxidation.

3.2.3. Evolution of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) 

One of the compounds produced from secondary oxidation in lipids is MDA (malondialdehyde) 

which can be measured by the TBARS method. The secondary lipid oxidation is responsible for the 

alteration of flavor, rancid odor and the undesirable taste in foods [42]. Secondary oxidation products 

were monitored by TBARS assay and are shown in Figure 3. Similar to PV, the control had the most 

rapid increase in TBARS followed by the BSA sample. TBARS values for samples treated with  

0.5% gentian powder, with and without BSA, experienced below 1.2 mg MDA/kg sample over the  

first 21 days and showed prominently lower than positive control up to 4 weeks (p < 0.05). The sample 

with 0.2% of G. Lutea alone does not display significant delay in lipid oxidation (p > 0.05), meanwhile 

0.2% G. Lutea with BSA and positive control showed significant different during 20 days (p < 0.05). 

From the TBARS results exhibited, the synergic effect between both the concentration of  

G. Lutea and BSA in the emulsion during the storage time is demonstrated and the samples with both 

(gentian and BSA) show the lowest oxidation rate compared to all samples. 

After 23 days, all samples are oxidized with above 1.2 mg malondialdehyde/kg sample even though 

G. Lutea with the BSA mixture showed minimum rise and had the best antioxidant effect in the 

emulsion. This behavior is not new. It has been previously reported that artificial antioxidants such as 

Trolox, epigallocatechingallate (EGCG), caffeic acid are more stable in emulsions during storage in 

the presence of BSA than in its absence [34]. 

G. Lutea has compounds which of family of iridoids, scoiridoids and xanthones [3]. It could be 

developed as antioxidant agent and radical scavengers and may contribute to the decrease of lipid 

oxidation [43]. The water soluble antioxidant molecular structures differ in the number of phenolic 

hydroxyl groups, their location and the carboxylic acid group [34]. Thus, the range of structure 

presented may allow any possible interaction with the BSA to be detected.

Many findings determined such amount of natural plants work as antioxidant efficiently; depended 

on variation of system tested and plant preparation. However, the more important is to identify the 

minimum concentration required to reduce lipid oxidation significantly throughout storage time. 

Adding minimum amount of natural plant not only can delay lipid oxidation, but also to avoid some 

changes on sensorial quality and flavoured. Analysis on our data showed for G. Lutea required as 

minimum 0.5% (w/w) would be beneficial for reducing the velocity of lipid oxidation significantly in 

both primary and secondary oxidation in emulsion system (p < 0.05). Adding also 0.1% (w/w) of BSA 

gave better effect of the antioxidant activity towards emulsion, compare to sample with G. Lutea alone. 

The study confirmed the potential of edible G. Lutea to prevent oxidation of emulsion.

The HPLC analysis is targeted to identifysecoiridoid-glycoside, the bitter constituent occurred in 

the extract shown in (a) and (b). Results in Table 2 presentsecoiridoid glycoside; gentiopicroside, 

swerosideand amarogentin were the important compounds in the G. Lutea. The highest content of 

secoiridoidin G. Lutea extract in methanol-50% weregentiopicroside (1805 ± 62 mg/L extract) and the 

amount of sweroside found was 72 ± 4 mg/L extract. It was not possible to identifyamarogentin in the 

extract, meanwhile only low traces of amarogentinwere found in various commercial G. Lutea  

(less than 0.09%) [3]. Carnat et al. [28] also reported that amarogentin can only be found in some  

fresh root of G. Lutea. There are comprehensive studies measuring the active compound in G. Lutea 

using bioassay-guided fractionation such as HPLC [3], CapilaryElectrophoris [44] and Thin Layer 

Chromatography [45]. From the literature study, there is constituent of secoiridoidthat has not been 

identified in this study (swertiamarin)are believed to be existed in the extract [2]. This is most likely 

due to the objective of the method was not optimize the quantification of the traces but to measure the 

antioxidant activity of each compound in the G. Lutea extract.

Aberham et al. [3] analyzed the active compound of 12 commercial samples of G. Lutea root.  

They found that swertiamarin was shown to have consistent occurrence between 0.21% and 0.45% and 

gentiopicroside was the most dominant compound in the sample up to 9.53%. Meanwhile,  

Ando et al. [46] reported that gentiopicroside was not detected from the fresh roots of 3-year-old  

G. Lutea. In contrast, Hayashi et al. [47] described that one year root contains high amounts of 

gentiopicroside and amarogentin and decreases over 5 years. 

The Gentianaceae family is well known for its intensive bitter root used as a tonic for the digestive 

system with many pharmacological benefits. There are other plants such as Swertiachirayita [48]  

and Lonicera japonica [49] that also possess similar compounds of secoiridoid-glycosides 

(swertiamarin and sweroside). 

Investigation of the main individual compounds in G. Lutea root was previously developed and 

optimized by Aberham et al. [2,3]. Furthermore, a substantial number of studies have demonstrated the 

effect of the secoiridoid group on the scavenging function to generate free radicals [7,13,48].  

Wei et al. [13] reported that five secoiridoids, including gentiopicroside, sweroside, swertiamarin and 

sweroside, did not show any scavenging ability towards free radicals by in vitro DPPH assay. 

However, taking into account their report, it was desirable to explore more individual extracted 

compounds by isolating the compounds followed by a biochemical assay, such as ABTS radical, to 

measure their activity. Online post-column methods are very dependable because they combine 

systems for investigating different features of the sample simultaneously. Our initial observation of 

using in vitro ABTS assay showed that gentiopicroside and sweroside displayed no scavenging activity 

towards ABTS radicals (data not shown) while the activity of these compounds is similar towards 

DPPH radicals. However, our finding showed an activity of amarogentin analyzed by ABTS in-vitro 

assay (644.5 ± 17.5 mg eq TE/L sample). However, the amarogentin was not identified in the extract, 

as discussed above. This is in contrast with Phoboo et al. [48] who observed no scavenging activity of 

amarogentin towards DPPH radical. 

The HPLC separated analytes reacted with ABTS radical post column (see Figure 4) and the 

reduction was detected as a negative peak at 734 nm. In Figure 5, the chromatographic analysis 

showed gentiopicroside (a) and sweroside (b) detected in G. Lutea extract and unknown compounds, 

(c) and (d), detected as negative peaks using the ABTS radical assay, which indicated that these 

components had free radical scavenging activity. The result of antioxidant response peaks (negative 

peak) of the G. Lutea compounds, expressed as mg galic acid equivalent (GAE)/L extract, indicates 

their relative contribution to the antioxidant activity of the extract with concentration taken into 

account. Analysis of G. Lutea extract of total antioxidant activity had been reported several times 

mainly measured by DPPH in vitro assay [10,14]. Even though we were unable to identify the 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 467 

 

 

compound relevant to the scavenging activity in the post-column ABTS assay, the results showed that 

the antiradical capacity of G. Lutea is not related to gentiopicroside and sweroside. There are many 

other compounds that maybe related to the scavenging activity in the extract such as  

xanthone-glycosides.

 radical scavenging method. (a) Gentiopicroside; (b) Sweroside; (c) 

antiradical activity by unknown compound; 31.33 ± 1.16 mg GAE/L and (d) antiradical 

activity by unknown compound; 8.30 ± 0.12 mg GAE/L. 

 

Nevertheless, our finding showed that the 0.5% G. Lutea extracts is able to delay the process of 

oxidation and give better storage stability as emulsion. However, this activity is not due to the bitter 

compounds (gentiopicroside amarogentin and sweroside) presented in our extract. Studies (from the 

revised literature) proved that xanthone compounds such as gentioside, gentisin and isogentisin found 

in G. Lutea have antiradical activity even though their constituents possess remarkable activity in 

pharmacological study 

4. Conclusions 

G. Lutea has valuable pharmacological properties due to the bitter properties of its  

secoiridoid-glycosides; their extraction using methanol-water mixture was better than water alone.  

G. Lutea extract showed excellent antioxidant activity in aqueous methanol measured by DPPH 

scavenging activity assay and Trolox equivalent capacity assay (TEAC) methods (15.89 and 48.90 μmol 

of TE/g DW, respectively). G. Lutea lyophilize can be applied as antioxidants in oil-in-water 

emulsions. 0.2% (w/w) of lyophilize. G. Lutea does not inhibit lipid oxidation significantly.  



Antioxidants 2014, 3 468 

 

 

An amount of 0.5% (w/w) G. Lutea lyophilise exhibited antioxidant activity towards primary and 

secondary oxidation in an o/w emulsion. Adding 0.1% (w/w) BSA with G. Lutea in an emulsion 

showed a synergic effect and better activity in delaying lipid oxidation. 

Gentiopicroside and sweroside found in HPLC analysis do not show any antiradical capacity in  

G. Lutea aqueous methanol extract. However, total antiradical capacities shown in post-column 

measurements presented activities of 31.33 ± 1.16 mg GAE/L and 8.30 ± 0.12 mg GAE/L towards the 

ABTS free radical. This study confirmed that G. Lutea roots as a source of edible natural antioxidants 

have potential to be used by the food industry.
