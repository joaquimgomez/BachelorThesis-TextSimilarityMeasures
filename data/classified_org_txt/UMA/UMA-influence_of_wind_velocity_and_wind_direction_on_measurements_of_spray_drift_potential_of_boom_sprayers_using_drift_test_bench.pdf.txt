Abstract 12 

In 2009, the European Directive for a Sustainable Use of Pesticides (128/2009/CE) 13 

established important mandatory actions to be accomplished by all Member States (MS) 14 

in the European Union. The main objective is to achieve the sustainable use of 15 

pesticides by reducing their risks and impacts on human health and the environment. 16 

Among other important actions, drift reduction measures are essential to avoid the entry 17 

of plant protection products (PPP) in water or other undesirable areas. As the risk of 18 

environmental contamination is directly related to the spray application technology, 19 

there is a strong need for objective methods for drift evaluation as well as robust 20 

procedures for the classification of sprayers according to their risk of contamination. 21 



For this purpose, and as a complementary tool to actual drift measurement 22 

methodologies in the field or in laboratory conditions, a new method has been proposed 23 

for the quantification of the potential drift generated by horizontal boom sprayer 24 

systems using an ad hoc test bench. 25 

This study aims to evaluate the influence of wind velocity and wind direction on the 26 

drift potential value (DPV) using the proposed methodology and test bench. The results 27 

indicated that wind velocities below 1.0 m s-1 have a negligible influence on the DPV. 28 

Front wind led to higher DPVs than lateral wind. A global analysis of data indicates that 29 

the proposed methodology and test bench are interesting tools for the quick and 30 

objective evaluation of the potential drift if used in appropriate environmental 31 

conditions. 32 

Keywords: drift potential value (DPV), drift test bench, wind velocity, wind direction, 33 

spray deposition, spray drift. 34 

Highlights 35 

A drift test bench is promising for assessing the drift potential of boom sprayers 36 

Wind velocity <1 m s-1 does not impact drift potential value of medium spray nozzles 37 

Wind direction relative to bench position affects DPV more than does wind velocity 38

1. Introduction 40 

The European Directive for a Sustainable Use of Pesticides (128/2009/EC) (EP, 2009), 41 

officially published in October 2009, established a point of no return in Europe for the 42 



improvement of all aspects pertaining to crop protection. Improved crop protection 43 

processes with higher efficacy and efficiency could increase the benefits of plant 44 

protection products (PPP) while reducing the risk of environmental contamination and 45 

realizing better and high-quality food production and more sustainable agriculture. 46 

Currently, agriculture is considered a major contributor to water pollution owing to the 47 

use of nitrates, phosphates, and pesticides (Doruchowski et al., 2014). 48 

This directive required all EU Member States (MS) to establish dedicated buffer zones, 49 

defined as permanently vegetated areas of land that are managed separately from the 50 

remainder of a field or catchment for the runoff of various agricultural pollutants 51 

(Muscutt et al., 1993). The specific characteristics of these zones are defined in each 52 

MS’s National Action Plan (NAP). Among other technical information and 53 

specifications, the NAP must include the minimum requirements for buffer zone widths 54 

and its relation with different spray application techniques, mainly in terms of its 55 

capacity to reduce/avoid drift, and therefore, the risk of environmental damage. It is 56 

therefore clear that drift measurement methodologies along with an accurate 57 

classification scheme for every single sprayer/technology based on the potential 58 

contamination risk are essential tools. 59 

Spray drift, defined as ‘the quantity of plant protection product that is carried out of the 60 

sprayed (treated) area by the action of air currents during the application process’ (ISO, 61 

2005) can be one of the most important (or main) factors affecting the risk of 62 

environmental pollution with pesticides, and therefore, there is a strong need for drift 63 

measurement methods. Moreover, according to the measured values, standardized 64 

protocols for the classification/evaluation of different spray technologies based on their 65 

risk of contamination are also required. These two steps will allow the MS to proceed 66 



with a proportional definition and sizing of buffer zones that are more adapted to 67 

particular situations. 68 

In the last few years, several studies aimed at evaluating and quantify the effect of the 69 

different parameters involved in spray drift. Nevertheless, considerable effort is required 70 

to classify different crop protection techniques in spray drift reduction classes (ISO, 71 

2006). This is further complicated by the fact that these classes frequently vary greatly 72 

because of the influence of weather conditions (Zande et al., 2000; Balsari et al., 2007; 73 

Zande et al., 2010) and by differences in the measurement protocols and techniques 74 

(Arvidsson et al., 2011).  75 

In most cases, the spray drift measurements in the field follow the standardized protocol 76 

established by ISO 22866:2005, resulting in very complicated and time-consuming 77 

experiments (Phillips and Miller, 1999; Ravier et al., 2005; Carlsen et al., 2006; 78 

Schampheleire et al., 2008; Rimmer et al., 2009) and even a high dependence on 79 

external factors. Moreover, field experiments with different spraying systems cannot be 80 

performed under directly comparable and exactly repeatable conditions. Information 81 

about the driftability of an intended sprayer configuration can typically be obtained; 82 

however, these results are unsuitable for establishing any type of ranking or 83 

classification because of their great variability. The difference in drift reduction 84 

capabilities can therefore generally be determined only through sufficient repetitions 85 

under similar conditions and pair- wise comparison. The fall-out drift measurements 86 

presented in literature (Arvidsson et al., 2011) can, in some cases, differ by as much as a 87 

factor of 10 for the same nozzle size and working pressure, which can be attributed to 88 

different factors such as the weather conditions and spray application technology 89 

(Nuyttens et al., 2006). Arvidsson et al (2011) found 0.20% and 0.94% variations in 90 

drift per degree temperature and per m s-1 wind velocity, respectively. 91 



Therefore, various studies have proposed alternatives for drift measurements in an 92 

attempt to develop easy, repeatable, and precise methods as complementary procedures 93 

to actual standards. One of the proposed alternatives, related to field crop sprayers, is 94 

Balsari et al.’s (2007) use of an ad hoc drift test bench. This method allows the drift 95 

potential value (DPV) to be quantified during a simulated application process with 96 

selected working parameters. Gil et al. (2014) used this method for measuring the DPV 97 

of a range of conventional and air injection flat fan nozzles. Their results demonstrated 98 

that the drift test bench can be considered an adequate complement to actual standard 99 

protocols for field measurements of drift (ISO, 2005). Zande et al. (2014) found similar 100 

results for field measurements (ISO 22866) using a test bench, and they ranked the 101 

nozzles that were similar in terms of drift reduction classes. Other indoor tests reported 102 

good correlation between the drift reduction potentials from the test bench and the wind 103 

tunnel measurements (Nuyttens et al., 2014). 104 

ISO’s ad hoc working group for drift measurements (ISO TC 23/SC 6/WG 16) officially 105 

adopted the test bench as a new method for measuring the drift potential of horizontal 106 

boom sprayer systems (ISO, 2014). However, further investigations are required to 107 

clarify the effect of environmental conditions (mainly wind velocity and its relative 108 

direction to the bench) to define the maximum limits for these wind factors so as to 109 

avoid a negative influence on the results. Vanella et al. (2011) concluded that this 110 

method needs relatively stable atmospheric conditions, as the combined effects of wind 111 

velocity and direction significantly affected the drift potential of the sprayer.  112 

In the context of improving the present ISO draft standard concerning drift potential 113 

measurements by the use of test bench, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the 114 

effect of wind velocity and wind direction on the DPV in order to define a  wind 115 

velocity threshold value to indicate in that ISO methodology. Repetitive field trials were 116 



made keeping all the other sprayer working parameters (forward velocity, nozzle 117 

characteristics, working pressure, and boom height) constant. For this purpose a 118 

reference spraying system defined according to ISO 22369-2 was tested through 20 119 

repetitions.. 120 

2. Materials and methods 121 

2.1 Experimental design 122 

The bench consists of a 12 m × 0.5 m steel frame with slots for collectors (Petri dishes) 123 

situated at 0.5-m intervals (Figure 1). Each slot is equipped with a sliding cover that 124 

makes it possible to cover/uncover the collector as needed. Once the boom sprayer 125 

passes by the entire bench, a pneumatic system automatically uncovers the collectors to 126 

capture the spray fraction that remains suspended in the atmosphere behind the boom 127 

before settling after some time. The purpose of the bench is to collect and quantify, in 128 

the absence of wind, the potential drift fraction, defined as the spray fraction that 129 

remains suspended over the bench immediately after the sprayer pass and that can be 130 

carried out of the target zone by weather air currents (Balsari et al., 2007). 131 

A 12-m-long stainless steel bench was placed at the centre of the right-hand-side spray 132 

boom of the sprayer at 3.0 m from the centre axis of the tractor in coincidence with the 133 

middle point of the right-hand side of the boom (Gil et al., 2014), maintaining a NW-SE 134 

position relative to the wind direction. Artificial collectors with a capture area of 153.94 135 

cm2 (Petri dishes with 14-cm diameter) were placed at 0.5-m intervals along the bench 136 

slots. The sample position was 0.30 m above the ground, as recommended by ISO 137 

(2014). The first two collectors remained permanently uncovered whereas the others on 138 

the bench (length: 10 m) were initially covered using the sliding plates of the test bench. 139 

The sprayer started application using only the right-hand side of the boom half over the 140 



bench, spraying a 2 mg/L solution of water and tracer (yellow Tartrazine E 102). The 141 

spray track started 20 m before the bench and then moved over the bench with the 142 

covered collectors. Spraying was continued for a further 20 m after the end of the test 143 

bench, for a total spray length of 52 m. After the sprayer passed over the end of the 144 

bench and reached a point exactly 2 m beyond the last covered collector, an automatic 145 

pneumatic system activated the sliding covers initiated by the passing spray boom, 146 

which revealed the Petri dishes so as to capture the droplets still airborne over the 147 

bench. Droplets were collected for 60 s after the opening of the system. Every single 148 

Petri dish was then covered, adequately labelled, and placed in dry and dark conditions 149 

until the laboratory determination of the tracer concentration. To determine the presence 150 

of tracer as background in the environment before each trial, two open petri dishes were 151 

placed on the bench and picked up before the next spray test. The tracer concentration at 152 

the artificial collectors was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific 153 

Genesys 20). 154 

Field trials were conducted 20 times using a conventional mounted 12-m boom sprayer 155 

(Ilemo Hardi, S.A.U., Lleida, Spain). The working pressure (3.0 bar), sprayer forward 156 

speed (6 km h-1), boom height above the test bench surface (0.5 m), and nozzle type and 157 

size (XR 110 03 flat fan nozzle 110° Teejet®, Spraying Systems Co., Wheaton, Illinois, 158 

USA) were selected according to the reference spraying system (ISO, 2010) and 159 

maintained constant during all the tests (Fig. 2). The resulting spray volume rate was 160 

236 L ha-1. 161 

During the tests, weather conditions such as the wind velocity, wind direction, air 162 

temperature and relative humidity were recorded continuously every second s at 2.0 m 163 

height from the ground. For this purpose, a Campbell weather station with a Datalogger 164 

CR800, a sonic anemometer (wind sonic 232), and two temperature and humidity 165 



sensors (HC2S3) were placed laterally 5 m from the test bench position and 5 m from 166 

the end of the bench, avoiding any interference at the measurement area.  167 

2.2 Quantification of DPV 168 

After the sprayer passed over the bench, the deposit on each artificial collector (Di) 169 

(unit: μL cm-2), was calculated as follows: 170 

 171 

where Di is the spray deposit on a single deposit collector (unit: μL cm-2); ρsmpl, the 172 

absorbance value of the sample (adim.); ρblk, the absorbance value of the blanks (adim.); 173 

Vdil, the volume of the dilution liquid (deionised water) used to dissolve the tracer 174 

deposit from the collector (unit: μL); ρspray, the absorbance value of the spray mix 175 

concentration applied during the tests and sampled at the nozzle (adim.); and Acol, the 176 

projected area of the collector for capturing the spray drift (unit: cm2). 177 

Once the amount of tracer on every single collector was measured, the DPV was 178 

calculated as follows:  179 

 180 

where DPV is the drift potential value (dimensionless); Di, the spray deposit on a single 181 

deposit collector (unit: µL cm-2); n, the number of collectors (20); and RSD, the 182 

reference spray deposit under the boom as calculated using the intended volume rate 183 

(unit: µL cm-2). 184 

𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 =

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑉𝑉 =  �𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷⁄ × 100

𝑖𝑖=1

 



RSD represents the intended (theoretical) amount of spray deposit in the treated area, 185 

assuming a perfectly even distribution under the boom. For the first set of trials, the 186 

RSD values ranged from 1.5 µL cm-2 (150 L ha-1) to 3.25 µL cm-2 (325 L ha-1). The 187 

RSD values were compared with the actually measured deposition values in the 188 

uncovered collectors to obtain an understanding of the spray deposition under the boom 189 

and to verify the eventual main deviations from the expected value.  190 

2.3 Statistical analysis 191 

The data analysis consisted of evaluating the correlation between the wind 192 

characteristics (velocity and direction) and DPV; also was analysed the relationship 193 

between wind velocity and the recovery values (%) on the uncovered Petri dishes. This 194 

analysis was performed using R software (R Development Core Team, 2011).  195 

3. Results 196 

3.1 Wind characteristics during field trials 197 

The average wind velocity was 0.4–2.4 m s-1, which allowed the correlation between the 198 

wind characteristics and the DPV to be measured in each case. The wind direction in 199 

relation to bench placement and tractor driving line was also recorded. During the field 200 

trials, the most frequent wind directions were SE-NW (front wind relative to spray 201 

track) and SW-NE (lateral wind). Figure 3 shows the distribution of all wind directions 202 

during the trials and their relation with the bench position.. The average temperature 203 

during the trials was 17 °C, with a maximum of 18.9 °C and minimum of 16.1 °C. The 204 

relative humidity was 66.3%–91.4%. Table 1 shows the mean values of all the 205 

parameters recorded during the field trials. 206 



During each trial, values of wind velocity and wind direction were recorded every 207 

second.. A further analysis of these parameters (Fig. 4) indicates that wind velocities 208 

corresponding to a lateral wind direction showed less variation during the trials than that 209 

observed for frontal winds. Interestingly, the wind direction was generally more 210 

uniform than wind velocity during each trial. 211 

The correlation between the wind velocity and the wind direction is mostly important. 212 

Figure 5 shows the correlation of the average values of wind velocity and wind 213 

direction and its relation with the bench position. Interestingly, the wind velocities were 214 

generally higher for front wind even with highly dispersed values. However, at these 215 

high wind velocities corresponded the highest spray deposits registered in the Petri 216 

dishes, resulting in the highest DPV values (Fig. 6). 217 

3.2 Correlation between DPV and wind characteristics 218 

Fig. 6 shows the DPV obtained in each spray test and its relation with the wind velocity. 219 

DPVs obtained for an average wind velocity lower than 1 m s-1 showed great 220 

uniformity, and no significant relationship was found between the DPV and the wind 221 

velocity (Table 2). The coefficient of variation of all DPVs obtained in the trials under 222 

wind velocity lower than 1 m s-1 was 5.29%, with an average DPV of 23.7. These 223 

results are consistent with those of previous studies (Gil et al., 2014). Fig. 6 shows that 224 

the DPV values obtained with wind velocity over 1 m s-1 (average: 65.26) presented a 225 

higher variability (CV: 29.03%). According to the obtained results, a safety threshold of 226 

wind velocity can be established at a maximum environmental average wind velocity of 227 

1 m s-1. A deeper analysis of the relation between DPV and wind characteristics 228 

indicates that more erratic values were obtained with SE wind direction (front wind 229 



related to test bench position), whereas S-SW wind direction (lateral wind related to 230 

bench placement) had much less effect on the DPV (Fig. 6).  231 

A detailed analysis of the relationship between DPV and wind direction indicates that 232 

front wind has much more effect on DPV than lateral wind. Considering the tests results 233 

(Table 3), with the front wind the highest values of DPV (65.26) and coefficient of 234 

variation (47.78%) were obtained. When tests were operated with front wind, DPV 235 

ranged from 110.42 (max) to 16.04 (min). On the opposite, when tests were made with 236 

lateral wind more uniform data, with a narrower range of variability, were obtained. It is 237 

also interesting to remark the important differences on the values of Parson’s coefficient 238 

of correlation when comparing DPV with wind direction. While for the front wind the 239 

Pearson’s coefficient was 0.3417, for the lateral wind it was -0.489. All those figures 240 

allow considering the front wind as with more influence on DPV, if compared with 241 

lateral wind. 242 

The effect of wind direction can also be observed in Fig. 7, which separately plots the 243 

deposition curves along the test bench obtained from all the trials with S-SW wind 244 

direction, corresponding to lateral wind, and the deposition curves obtained for the case 245 

of front wind (SE wind). Important differences among the deposition on the collectors, 246 

mainly in the last part of the test bench, were observed as a consequence of the wind 247 

direction. In general, front wind blows spray droplets towards the last part of the bench, 248 

generating a soft and homogeneous slope on the deposition curves, with relatively high 249 

deposition on the rear part of the bench.  250 

Another important effect of wind direction can be explained by the analysis of the 251 

cumulative deposition along the test bench. Fig. 8 shows the cumulative deposition 252 

curves obtained separated by the two different wind directions, front and lateral wind. In 253 



this case, too, the effect of wind direction on the DPV is clear. The spray plume seems 254 

to be displaced to the rear in the case of front wind, being collected 50% of the total 255 

deposit in the first three meters of the bench, while the same percentage with lateral 256 

wind was collected at the first one and a half meter of the bench (Fig. 8). 257 

3.3 Effect of wind on recovery deposit on uncovered collectors 258 

The recovery efficiency of the two uncovered petri dishes placed at the beginning of the 259 

test bench during each trial was evaluated by calculating the percentage of liquid 260 

collected from the total expected according to the spray volume applied as follows: 261 

𝑅𝑅 (%) =  
𝐶𝑠 𝑥 𝑉𝑉𝑠

𝑅𝑅 𝑥 𝐶𝑑  𝑥 𝐷𝐷
 𝑥 107 

where R is the recovery value on uncovered collectors (%); Cs, the tracer concentration 262 

measured on the collector (µg L-1); Vs, the amount of water added for tracer extraction 263 

(mL); S, the collector surface (cm2); Cd, the tracer concentration in the tank (µg L-1); 264 

and D, the intended applied volume rate (L ha-1). 265 

Fig. 9 shows the influence of the wind velocity on the recovery capacity of the 266 

uncovered samples. The ANOVA test conducted to evaluate the recovery values 267 

obtained on the uncovered collectors indicates no significant relationship between the 268 

percentage recovery and the wind velocity (P < 0.05), particularly for wind velocities 269 

below 1.5 m s-1 (Table 4). The average recovery value was 87% for all the tests with a 270 

wind velocity below 1.5 m s-1, indicating the good functioning of the spray boom 271 

distribution. 272 

3.4 Spatial effect of wind direction on DPV 273 



The deposition curves of all trials were grouped according to the wind direction in 274 

relation with the bench position. Fig. 10 shows the averaged deposition curves obtained 275 

during all trials with lateral and front winds. The figure also shows the tendency curves 276 

for the two cases and a plot of their corresponding mathematical expressions. In this 277 

sense, the differences in deposition values along the test bench are noteworthy for the 278 

two wind directions, being constants for every sampling point.  279 

4. Conclusions 280 

As specified in ISO 22369-2, 2010, weather conditions, especially those affecting wind 281 

velocity and wind direction, have a variable influence on the final evaluation of the drift 282 

potential obtained using a test bench. The results obtained from 20 tests operated at 283 

different wind velocities and wind directions indicated that DPVs were not statistically 284 

influenced when trials were conducted with average wind velocities below 1 m s-1. This 285 

value is higher than that recommended as  maximum limit for wind velocity during 286 

trials in the new proposed standard (ISO DIS 22401), which was initially 0.5 m s-1. 287 

The wind direction relative to the test bench  and tractor forward direction clearly 288 

influenced the spatial distribution of the spray deposition recovered along the whole 289 

bench and affected the DPV values themselves. Front winds tended to provide  higher 290 

deposits on the rear part of the test bench. Therefore, field tests for drift measurements 291 

using a test bench should be arranged carefully considering the wind direction relative 292 

to the bench.  293 

No significant effect was detected on recovery values on uncovered Petri dishes in trials 294 

conducted with wind velocities below 1.5 m s-1, resulting in an average value of 87%. 295 

The recovery value on uncovered Petri dishes is a remarkable indicator of the actual 296 



applied volume, avoiding undesirable mistakes during trials, and of the fact that no 297 

deviations in spray distribution occurred during the tests. 298
