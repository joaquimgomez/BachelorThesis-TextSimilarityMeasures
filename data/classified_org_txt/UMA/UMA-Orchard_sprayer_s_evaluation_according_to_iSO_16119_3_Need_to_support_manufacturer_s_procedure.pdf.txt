Summary

Since the publication of European Directive (2009/127/EC), environmental requirements 
for new orchard sprayers are mandatory. Only equipment which has successfully 
accomplished the specifications can be placed into the EU market. For this purpose, the 
new harmonized ISO 16119 series represents an interesting tool to fulfil the requirements.  
In order to evaluate the difficulties to accomplish the official requirements, a new orchard 
mistblower (2000 L Inverter Qi 9.0 Ecoteqi) was evaluated following the corresponding 
standard. During the evaluation process a large list of complementary standards was 
identified to be accomplished for the purpose. The tests associated were complex, expensive 
and time-consuming. Parts of the standards were detected as undefined criteria or not clearly 
adapted for orchard sprayers. All these difficulties represent a great challenge for most SME 
manufacturers all around the EU. All these reasons underlined the need to improve the 
relationship between sprayer’s manufacturers and national representatives on International 
Standardization Bodies. As a consequence, a practical guideline for Spanish sprayer’s 
manufacturers has been developed by UMA-UPC in order to enlarge the knowledge of 
ISO 16119 series and its practical application.

Introduction

Air assisted orchard sprayers are usually employed for spray application in vineyards and fruit 
crops. The turbulent air current generated helps to transport the droplets, penetrating the vegetation 
while moving leaves and branches (Salcedo et al., 2015). But only a part of the product reaches 
the tree (Garcerá et al., 2017). The rest of the applied volume ends up in the atmosphere (Zivan et 
al., 2017) or on the ground (Patinha et al., 2017). These off-target losses can suppose a negative 
effect to the environment (Gustavsson et al., 2017) and human health (Kim et al., 2017). Several 
factors influence the application’s efficiency such as the wind action (Grella et al., 2017), canopy 
characteristics (O’Donnell et al., 2017) or characteristics of selected spray technology (Dekeyser 
et al., 2013).
In order to avoid potential risk of contamination, the sprayer shall be in optimum condition, 

without any leaks or dangerous areas to the driver. The prototype should be designed to apply the 
product efficiently, minimizing losses and waste and allowing complete cleaning of the equipment 
(Miranda-Fuentes et al., 2017). 
But, other than weather conditions, working parameters and canopy characteristic, efficiency and 

quality of any spray application process require a correct, safe and well calibrated sprayer. For 
that reason, in October 2009 two European Directives were published focused on the use phase 



38

of pesticides (Gil, 2006): European Directive 2009/128/EC for Sustainable Use of Pesticides, 
addressing among other aspects the mandatory inspection of sprayers in use in Europe; and European 
Directive 2009/127/EC amending 2006/42/EC with regard to the spraying equipment, establishes 
the essential environmental and safety requirements to be accomplished for new sprayers. European 
sprayer’s manufacturers shall take all appropriate measures to be sure that their machinery may be 
placed on the market and put into service accomplishing the relevant provisions established in the 
legislation. For this reason, following the Directive 2009/127/EC, the European Commission and 
European Free Trade Association required to the European Committee for Standardization a standard 
for new sprayers to indicate to the manufacturers the minimum conditions for the different aspects 
of the machine (cleaning system, agitators, induction hoppers, etc.) to diminish environmental 
risks. As a consequence, a new ISO 16119 series (ISO, 2013) was published in June 2014 as a 
harmonized standard in the Official Journal of the EU as a tool to help the sprayer’s manufacturers 
to fulfill all the mandatory requirements. Part 3 of this standard is focused on sprayers for bush 
and tree crops. However, not all sprayer’s manufacturers have facilities, devices and expertise to 
accomplish all the requirements, and even more, there are some tests included in the standard with a 
high level of complexity. In order to quantify the difficulties and the practical needs to apply the ISO 
16119-3 to a brand-new sprayer, the UMA-UPC research group arranged a complete test of a new 
trailed air assisted orchard sprayer (FEDE Inverter) with a volume tank of 2000 L following ISO 
16119-3. During the test particular attention was addressed to the practical difficulties (materials, 
water consumed…) encountered, to the resources and time request, in order to develop practical 
recommendations about the whole process of application.

Materials & Methods

Location and sprayer
Tests required in ISO 16119-3 were carried out at the Laboratory of Agricultural Mechanization 

of UMA-UPC (https://uma.deab.upc.edu) in Viladecans (Barcelona). The selected sprayer was a 
FEDE Inverter Qi 9.0 Ecoteqi (Fig. 1) with technology H3O (Pulverizadores Fede, S.L., Cheste, 
Spain). 

Fig. 1. Selected FEDE sprayer (left) and detail during cleaning test (right) at UMA-UPC facilities.

The sprayer had 14 nozzle holders, with double outlet, divided into two symmetrical sections 
(seven nozzle holders in each side). The sprayer was equipped with five disc-core nozzles model 
D3-DC35 and two D3-DC25 (TeeJet, Spraying Systems Co., Wheaton, Illinois, USA) in both 
symmetrical sides. The nozzles DC25 were placed in the lowest position of the arch. The sprayers 
were also provided with an alternative set of D4 nozzles in the nozzle holder. Five lot positions 
were provided with nozzles D4-DC35 and two more with D4-DC25.

Complementary required standards
A complete fulfilment of ISO 16119-3 requires the complementary use of a large list of other 

standards. These standards (Table 1) are required to complete the assays/verifications included 
in ISO 16119-3. This situation represents one of the most difficult aspects from the sprayer’s 
manufactures, which in general are not provided with such a large list of standards.

Arranged laboratory trials
The assays arranged (Table 2) were those required by ISO 16119-3. The methodology to be 

used for the laboratory trials are usually mentioned in the other complementary standards. For the 
assay 7, about measuring systems, no indication is specified in the ISO 16119-3. In this case, the 
methodology explained in ISO 15122-3 (2015) was used, centered on sprayers for bush and tree 
crops. The product used was always water, although in the assays 8 (mixing), 11 and 12 (cleaning 
system in both cases) copper oxychloride was added. Only tests 9 and 10 did not need water or 
other product. It was not possible to complete the trials described in the ISO 21278-1 (ISO, 2008), 
focused in the induction hoppers due the difficulties to find the requested product.

Results & Discussion

Complexity
Considering the requested previous time for the preparation and arrangement of all the devices 

and material, the time requested for a clear understanding of the methodology (some difficulties 
during the interpretation of the Standard happened), and the time for the tests itself, more than 
five labour days of two technicians was necessary to verify if the tested sprayer fulfil the Directive

127 applying this standard. Table 3 includes all the requested tests carried out, the time dedicated 
for each trial, the requested material and the quantification of the total water volume used for the 
purpose. 
In addition it shoud be underlined the large amount of copper oxychloride needed for the  tests of 

sprayer cleaning and agitation system evaluation, and the related environmental contamination risk 
and for the operator’s health. These problems require specific facilities to arrange the established 
tests, always keeping the copper oxychloride under control.
A global balance indicates that around 88 h and 19700 L of water were used during the trials. 

These results emphasize, together with the material employed (Table 3), the cost and time that 
these tests require. In addition, in a country with water deficiency problems, such as Spain, the 
high volumes of water used need to be considered.

Need for a practical guideline
The arranged work demonstrated the difficulties of evaluating the sprayers following the ISO 

16119-3. The assays were expensive, time-consuming and complex. A complete application of 
the standard may require a lot of resources. This can be a serious problem for a large number of 
European sprayer’s manufacturers bellowing to SME group, with limited resources and facilities. 
Even more, another difficulty not quantified is related to the lack of knowledge of most of those 
medium/small sprayer’s manufacturers, with great difficulty understanding all the established 
requirements. It is important to improve the communication and feedback from national 
representatives on the International Standardization Bodies and local manufacturers, in order to 
guarantee a clear and useful information channel. In this sense, as a requirement of the Spanish 
Association of Agricultural Machinery Manufacturers (ANSEMAT), UMA-UPC has developed a 
practical guideline (Fig. 2) with clear and practical information including real examples, in order 
to help the Spanish sprayer’s manufactures in the complex process of the accomplishment of ISO 
16119 series.

Conclusions

The experience demonstrated the difficulties encountered for a complete application and 
execution of all the tests described in ISO 16119. Considering the expertise of the research group, 
the complete facilities available for the purpose, the large amount of expertise’s time particularly

dedicated for the task (about 88 h), has demonstrated the difficulties that SME European sprayer’s 
manufacturers can find during the process. For these reasons, it is absolutely necessary to arrange 
a common support system for such a large number of EU manufacturers. And finally, an in depth 
review of the standard is recommended, especially for the part concerning orchard sprayers.
