Introduction
Lipid oxidation is the main cause of deterioration and 

reduced shelf life of cooked meat (1,2). This process may 
cause changes in meat quality parameters such as colour, 
fl avour, odour, texture, and even nutritional value. The 
heating process leads to increased oxidation of lipids in 
meat, which causes a warmed-over fl avour in chilled cooked 
meat products (3,4). The rate and extent of oxidation dete-
rioration can be reduced through various procedures like 
curing, vacuum packaging, modifi ed atmosphere packag-
ing and, most importantly, adding synthetic or natural 
antioxidants (5). Although synthetic antioxidants such as 

butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyani-
sole (BHA), propyl gallate and tertiary butylhydroqui-
none (TBHQ) have been used extensively, recent studies 
have revealed that they have various negative health ef-
fects on animal and human cells (6). Concerns regarding 
the safety and toxicity of synthetic antioxidants have mo-
tivated research into natural antioxidants derived from 
plant sources (such as oilseeds, cereal crops, vegetables, 
fruits, leaves, roots, spices and herbs) (7–9). In recent 
times, the functional antioxidant properties of numerous 
plant extracts containing phenolic compounds have been 
investigated in cooked meat products (10–12).

Summary

The eff ect of dried pods of Caesalpinia spinosa, known as tara, on pH, cooking loss, lip-
id oxidation, colour stability and texture of model meat systems stored at 4 °C for 21 days 
was investigated. Tara pod powder showing a potential antioxidant activity was added at 
0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 % (by mass) directly to the pork batt er and compared with a synthetic 
antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and control (no added antioxidants). The ad-
dition of tara pod powder at 0.02 % was as eff ective as BHA (0.02 %) in retarding lipid oxi-
dation in pork products during storage. Results showed that redness increased aft er the 
addition of tara pod powder. Specifi cally, 0.02 % of tara pod powder was eff ective in keep-
ing the red colour of meat batt er stored under illumination at 4 °C for 48 h. Hardness of 
pork products was the lowest in samples manufactured with tara pod powder compared 
with control. Results highlight the potential of using tara pod powder as natural functional 
ingredient in the development of pork products with enhanced quality and shelf life.

Tara (Caesalpinia spinosa) is a leguminous tree indige-
nous to South America, having 8 to 10 cm long red or pale 
yellow pods. It can be found in the regions of Venezuela, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, up to the north of 
Chile. It grows wild on the Peruvian coast and in Andean 
region at altitudes from 1000 to 2900 m above sea level 
(13). Peru is considered the most important producer 
worldwide with more than 80 % of the world production 
(14). Tara infusions have been traditionally and extensive-
ly used in Peruvian folk medicine to treat infl amed ton-
sils, fever, cold and stomachaches (15). Tara pods (with-
out seeds) represent approx. 65 % (by mass) of the fruit. 
Ground tara pods are rich in hydrolysable tannins (be-
tween 40–60 %, by mass), with gallic acid as the main con-
stituent (16). Tara tannins are used in the manufacture of 
leather furniture, as a wine clarifi er, and as a source for 
obtaining the antioxidant gallic acid used in the oil indus-
try (13). Anti-infl ammatory, antifungal, antibacterial and 
antiseptic properties have been att ributed to tara tannins 
(15–18).

Tara pod extracts rich in gallic acid and tannins were 
successfully applied to increase the oxidation stability of 
oils (14,19) and oil-in-water emulsions (20). Although not 
yet reported in the literature, tara pods could be incorpo-
rated in cooked meat products as a source of natural anti-
oxidants to prolong quality and stability. For all these rea-
sons, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the eff ect 
of tara pods on lipid oxidation, colour stability and tex-
tural properties of cooked meat model systems stored at 4 
°C.

Materials and Methods

Plant and meat material
Fruit pods of Caesalpinia spinosa (tara) were a com-

mercial product from Peru (Mabratan tara powder, Agro-
tara S.A.C., Lima, Peru). The dried powder of tara pods 
was stored in darkness, at room temperature. Post-rigour 
pork ham and fresh pork back fat were obtained from a 
meat plant ‘Jadwiga, Edward, Grzegorz Dworeccy’ placed 
in Golejewo, Poland. The meat was trimmed of visible fat 
and connective tissue. Lots of approx. 500 g were packed, 
frozen and stored at –20 °C until use.

Preparation of the extract and hydrolysis
The extraction of phenolic compounds was carried 

out at 4 °C for 20 h using 50 % (by volume) methanol/wa-
ter as solvent and a material/solvent ratio of 1:30 (by mass 
per volume). Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 10 000×g 
for 15 min and the supernatant was concentrated under 
vacuum at 38 °C until dryness. The resulting product was 
dissolved with Milli-Q water (Milipore Corporation, Bed-
ford, MA, USA). This aqueous solution was cooled at ap-
prox. 4 °C for 16 h and then again centrifuged at 10 000×g 
for 10 min to obtain a clarifi ed solution. Thus, the whole 
extract was obtained.

The extract was hydrolysed following the procedure 
of Chambi et al. (14). Briefl y, the whole extract was mixed 
with sulphuric acid until a fi nal concentration of 1 M 
H2SO4 and a phenolic compound concentration of 20 mg 

of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per mL were reached. The 
mixture was left  to stand at 100 °C for 9 h. The obtained 
hydrolysed tara extract was centrifuged at 10 000×g for 10 
min and then subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with 
ethyl acetate (1:2, by volume) twice consecutively. The 
ethyl acetate was removed under vacuum with a rotary 
evaporator at 38 °C until dryness and the remaining pellet 
was dissolved in absolute ethanol. This was purifi ed and 
hydrolysed extract of tara. The remaining aqueous phase 
rich in sulphuric acid was discarded.

Determination of gallic acid by high-performance liquid 
chromatography

High-performance liquid chromatography analyses 
of the tara pod extracts were carried out using an Acquity 
UPLC System (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with photodi-
ode array (PDA) detector. Tara pod extracts (10 μL) were 
injected into an analytical C18 column (5 μm, 3.9×150 mm; 
Symmetry, Waters) and the column temperature was set 
to 25 °C. The mobile phase was composed of 0.5 % formic 
acid (by volume) in acetonitrile (eluent A) and 0.5 % for-
mic acid (by volume) in water (eluent B). The gradient 
program was as follows: 5 % A (6 min), 5–95 % A (2 min), 
95 % A (5 min), 95–5 % A (1 min), 5 % A (6 min). Total run 
time was 20 min. The detection of gallic acid was made at 
273 nm. The standard was identifi ed by its retention time 
and the concentration of gallic acid was calculated by 
comparing the peak area of samples with that of the stan-
dard. Calibration curve was made for gallic acid using 
diff erent concentrations (10–100 ppm) and a high lineari-
ty (R2>0.999) was obtained.

DPPH free radical scavenging capacity
The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical 

scavenging activity of tara pod extract was determined 
according to the method described by Skowyra et al. (21). 
A solution of DPPH (5.07 mM) in pure methanol was pre-
pared. Appropriate dilutions were made for the study of 
the samples to allow the decrease in DPPH concentration 
to be in the range of 10–90 %. Then the solution of DPPH 
and samples (in a volume fraction of 10 % of sample and 
90 % of the radical) was added to the well of a microplate. 
Absorbance was measured at 517 nm, every 15 min for 60 
min. The ability to scavenge the DPPH free radical was 
calculated with the following equation:

  /1/

where Acontrol is the absorbance of the control sample and 
Asample is the absorbance of the DPPH solution containing 
the sample extract. A weaker absorbance of the reaction 
mixture indicated a stronger DPPH scavenging activity. 
The IC50 value, corresponding to the concentration of tara 
pod extract required to scavenge the DPPH radical by 50 
% in comparison with the control was also determined. 
The lower the IC50, the higher the antioxidant activity. 
Gallic acid was used as a standard.

Meat system formulation and processing
Meat and back fat packages were thawed (approx. 18 

h at (3±2) °C). Aft er this the materials were passed

through a grinder with a 0.6-cm plate model Diana 887.84 
(Zelmer, Rzeszów, Poland). Five diff erent meat model 
systems (meat batt ers) were made up with the same 
amounts of pork ham (55 %), pork back fat (24 %), curing 
salt (Solino S.A., Inowroclaw, Poland) (1.6 %) and iced 
water (19.4 %). A control formulation (control) was pre-
pared without the addition of antioxidant. Three other 
formulations were prepared with three diff erent mass 
fractions of dried tara pod powder: 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 %. 
The last meat batt er was prepared with a synthetic anti-
oxidant, 0.02 % butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; Sigma- 
-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A total of 15 batches (three 
independent replications per treatment) of pork batt ers 
were manufactured. All ingredients were placed in a cut-
ter (Büchi Mixer B-400; Labortechnik GmbH, Essen, Ger-
many) and mixed for approx. 5 s at 28 000×g. Finally, sam-
ples were manually stuff ed into the polypropylene tubes 
(diameter of 30 mm). The batt ers were then held for 2 h at 
4 °C to allow the ingredients to equilibrate. The batt ers 
were cooked by immersion in a water bath until the tem-
perature of products reached 72 °C (measured with a 
thermometer inserted into the centre of the batt er). The 
cooked batt ers were cooled down on ice, then taken out of 
the plastic tubes, dried, packaged in polyethylene bags 
and stored at 4 °C for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days.

Proximate composition and pH
Moisture and fat content of fi nal products were deter-

mined in triplicate by AOAC methods (22,23). Protein 
content was measured in duplicate using nitrogen ana-
lyzer KjeltecTM 2300 (FOSS, Hillerød, Denmark). Acidity 
of model meat products was measured directly using an 
Orion 3-Star pH Benchtop Meter (Thermo Fisher Scientif-
ic, Waltham, MA, USA).

Cooking loss
Cooking losses were determined immediately aft er 

the production and were expressed as mass diff erences of 
samples before and aft er cooking. Before evaluation, the 
fi nal products were dried using a paper towel.

Colour measurement
The surface colour of model meat products was eval-

uated using a refl ectance colourimeter Minolta CR-400 
(Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) and it was expressed 
against the scale of L* (lightness), a* (redness) and b* (yel-
lowness) in the CIELab colour space system. Before each 
measuring session (light source of D65 and 10° standard 
observer), the instrument was calibrated (white reference: 
Y=93.8; x=0.315; y=0.332). Colour measurement was con-
ducted six times for each variant of meat products direct-
ly aft er production. The evaluation was repeated aft er 7, 
14 and 21 days of cool storage in the darkness. Also, the 
slices of pork products were displayed under white fl uo-
rescent light (250 lx) at 4 °C for 48 h, simulating retail dis-
play conditions, and the colour measurement was carried 
out aft er 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h.

Lipid oxidation
The eff ect of tara pods on lipid oxidation of the 

chilled batt ers (initially and aft er 7, 14 and 21 days of stor-
age) was evaluated using a spectrophotometric 2-thiobar-

bituric acid (TBA) extraction method described by Grau et 
al. (24) with slight modifi cations. Briefl y, the TBARS re-
agent was prepared by mixing 15 % (by mass per volume) 
trichloroacetic acid and 0.375 % (by mass per volume) 
2-thiobarbituric acid in 0.25 M hydrochloric acid. The 
procedure was as follows: 1 g of each sample was weighed 
in a centrifuge tube, and 1 mL of 0.3 % aqueous EDTA 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added immedi-
ately to stop the progression of fat oxidation. Then, just 
before homogenisation, 5 mL of TBARS reagent were 
added to the tube, and the content was homogenised for 
1 min at 11 800×g using a Miccra D-1 homogeniser (ART 
Prozess & Labortechnik GmbH & Co., Müllheim, Germa-
ny), covered, placed in a boiling water bath for exactly 10 
min and then cooled for 30 min at room temperature. The 
mixture was centrifuged (Sigma 3K30; Sigma Laborzen-
trifugen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) at room 
temperature and 3400×g for 10 min. The absorbance of su-
pernatant was measured at 532 nm (spectrophotometer 
UV-1800; BRAIC, Beĳ ing, PR China). The TBARS values 
were expressed as mg of malondialdehyde (MDA) per kg 
of sample calculated using 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane 
(Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard. TBARS determinations 
for each sample were performed in triplicate.

Texture profi le analysis
The texture profi le analysis (TPA) of model meat 

products was conducted using Zwick/Roell Z010 testing 
machine (Zwick Testing Machines Ltd., Leominster, Here-
fordshire, UK) and TPA 50 test (50 % deformation, head 
speed 60 mm/min, relaxation time 30 s). The samples 
(slices of 15 mm×25 mm) were compressed twice to 50 % 
of their original height. The textural parameters of hard-
ness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess and chewi-
ness were measured (25). The evaluation was conducted 
at room temperature of (22±1) °C, directly aft er produc-
tion and aft er two weeks of storage.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate. Mean 

values of diff erent parameters were calculated and com-
pared by analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) using 
the STATISTICA soft ware v. 10 (StatSoft  Inc., Tulsa, OK, 
USA). Two-way ANOVA was carried out to test the sig-
nifi cance of the eff ect of tara pod powder addition and 
storage time. The signifi cance of diff erences between 
samples at the same storage time and the same sample at 
diff erent storage times was determined using Duncan’s 
test at the 95 % confi dence level (p<0.05).

Results and Discussion

Extract characterization
Hydrolysable tannins are common secondary metab-

olites in vascular plants and they are mainly found in 
leaves, buds, seeds, roots and tissues. Due to their antimi-
crobial activity, their main functions include plant de-
fence against many pathogen att acks, and also against 
herbivorous animals, making assimilation of substances 
(gallotannins and ellagitannins) contained in the plants

diffi  cult, and giving them an unpleasant taste. Useful tan-
nic compounds were found in the gall of walnut, such as 
chestnut and oak, in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) 
and in tara pods (26). It has been reported that 40–65 % of 
the fruit mass of C. spinosa corresponds to gallotannins. 
Hagerman (27) mentioned that gallotannins are hydro-
lysed, bonds between gallic acid and the polyol centre (es-
ter bonds) are broken and depside bonds, which are more 
easily hydrolysed than the ester bonds, are formed be-
tween gallic acids in meta- or para-position. The results of 
HPLC analysis (Fig. 1) revealed that gallic acid is present 
in small quantities (16.9 mg of gallic acid per g of tara 
pods), but aft er hydrolysis, it is liberated to a large extent 
(130.7 mg of gallic acid per g of tara pods). Our results are 
similar to the results found by Chambi et al. (14).

The scavenging activity of tara pod extracts, BHA 
and gallic acid (used as control) is shown in Table 1. Gal-
lic acid and hydrolysed extract of tara pod were the stron-
gest radical scavengers with IC50 of 7.3 and 8.3 μmol of 

GAE per L, respectively. It has been demonstrated that 
with the increase of the number of hydroxyl groups in the 
molecule, the antioxidant capacity of a phenolic com-
pound increases. Gallic acid has three hydroxyl groups, 
which increases its ability to donate electrons or hydro-
gens. Therefore, the antioxidant capacity of hydrolysed 
extracts of tara pod increases when gallic acid is released 
(14). The IC50 value of BHA was 50.8 μmol/L. Lower IC50 
values of gallic acid than of samples with BHA found in 
this study were also reported by Zhang et al. (28). The IC50 
value of tara pod extract (468.2 μmol/L) was considerably 
higher than that of the hydrolysed extract. Similar results 
showing the increase in the antioxidant activity aft er tan-
nin processing have previously been reported (16).

Proximate  composition, pH and cooking loss of pork 
meat batt ers

Table 2 shows chemical composition, pH and cooking 
loss of pork meat batt ers. The diff erences in moisture, fat 
and protein content, and pH among samples of cooked 
pork batt er were not signifi cant. Cooking loss measures 
the ability of the system to bind water and fat aft er pro-
tein denaturation and aggregation (4). Cooking mass loss-
es are one of the main parameters that aff ect meat quality 
and can be mainly ascribed to water exudates (29). Cook-
ing loss (Table 2) ranged from (5.2±0.4) to (6.3±0.2) %, and 
was the same in all samples containing tara pod powder 
and the control.

Colour values of cooked pork batt er
Instrumental colour parameters measured on the sur-

face of the cooked pork batt ers during 21 days of refriger-
ated storage are shown in Table 3. Lightness (L*) values of 
pork batt er samples with BHA, 0.02 and 0.04 % of tara 
pod powder decreased (p<0.05) during 21 days of storage. 
The decrease of L* value of pork meat products was also 
observed by Wójciak et al. (30) in organic pork sausages. 
On the other hand, L* values of the sample with 0.08 % of 
tara pod powder and the control sample were stable dur-
ing this period of storage. The most important colour pa-
rameter of meat products is the redness (a*) value. Mea-
sured a* values ranged from 6.1 to 7.6 immediately aft er 
packaging to 7.1 to 9.0 aft er 21 days of storage. Samples 
with 0.02 and 0.04 % of tara pod powder had signifi cantly 
(p<0.05) higher redness values compared to the sample 
with BHA and the control sample on day 21 of refrigerat-
ed storage. Yellowness (b*) values of samples with 0.02

and 0.04 % of tara pod powder were signifi cantly (p<0.05) 
lower than of the sample with BHA and control sample 
during entire storage period. On the other hand, redness 
values of the cooked batt ers stored under illumination at 
4 °C for 48 h (conditions similar to those in supermarkets 
and evaluated aft er 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h) ranged from 6.1 to 
7.6 immediately aft er packaging to 3.1 to 5.2 aft er 48 h of 
storage (Table 4). The a* value (5.2) of the sample with 
0.02 % of tara pod powder was signifi cantly (p<0.05) 
higher than of other samples aft er 48 h of storage under 
illumination. In addition, this sample had signifi cantly 
(p<0.05) lower lightness and yellowness values than con-
trol samples (without antioxidant and with BHA) aft er 48 
h of storage under illumination.

The colour of food in retail exerts a strong infl uence 
on the consumer’s decision to purchase. Maintaining col-
our att ractiveness is of primary importance since colour is 

the fi rst att ribute consumers use to evaluate meat quality 
and, therefore, it plays a major role in infl uencing pur-
chase decisions (2). Meat colour is determined by its haem 
pigment concentration, oxidation-reduction state and light- 
 -scatt ering properties (31). In the present study, the addi-
tion of tara powder (0.02 and 0.04 %) resulted in redder 
colouration of meat product in comparison with control 
samples (without antioxidants and with added BHA) 
during the entire storage period (21 days and 48 h under 
illumination) (p<0.05). In addition, L* and b* values of 
samples containing tara powder were reduced during stor-
age in comparison with control (p<0.05). Thus, the addi-
tion of tara pod powder changed the colour att ributes of 
cooked pork batt ers by increasing redness and decreasing 
lightness and yellowness.

The stabilising eff ect of natural antioxidants on col-
our has been observed and verifi ed in several studies

Oxidation stability of cooked pork batt er
The eff ect of tara powder on TBARS values in cooked 

pork batt ers during storage at 4 °C for 21 days is shown in 
Fig. 2. In general, storage time has a signifi cant infl uence 
on lipid oxidation in the cooked pork batt ers. TBARS val-
ues in all samples containing tara pod powder and in the 
sample with BHA were considerably lower (p<0.05) than 
in the control (without antioxidants). Tara pod powder 
showed high protection against lipid oxidation in cooked 
pork batt ers and no diff erences were observed between 
the samples containing 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 % tara pod 
powder. The lowest mass fraction of tara pod powder 
(0.02 %) in cooked pork batt ers showed strong lipid stabi-
lisation during storage, similar to BHA at the same mass 
fraction (0.02 %). Initial (day 1) TBARS values in all treated 
cooked pork batt ers were signifi cantly lower than those in 
the control (p<0.05), suggesting that the antioxidants re-
tarded lipid oxidation during and immediately aft er 
cooking. In all samples with tara pod powder and in the 
sample containing BHA, TBARS values were at the same 
level on day 21 ((0.19–0.23) mg of MDA per kg of product) 
as in the control sample on day 1 (0.21 mg of MDA per kg 
of product).

These oxidation/reduction eff ects of tara pod powder 
may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds such 
as phenolic acids. Tara pod extracts were reported to con-
tain free gallic acid and gallotannins (1.7 and 50.4 g of 
GAE per 100 g, respectively). These two compounds rep-

resented approx. 95 % of the total phenolics present in 
tara pods. The remaining 5 % of tara phenolics possibly 
comprise ellagitannins and other phenolic compounds 
(14). Romero et al. (19) found that tara pod extract ob-
tained by supercritical fl uid extraction with CO2 had high 
antioxidant activity and was effi  cient in inhibiting rancid-
ity deterioration of sunfl ower oil by improving its stabili-
ty. Skowyra et al. (20) also reported a high level of antioxi-

dant protection in oil-in-water emulsion with the addition 
of tara extracts obtained with 75 % ethanol. The addition 
of 48 μg/mL of this extract to the emulsion with 10 % oil 
delayed oxidation to the same extent as 17.8 μg/mL of 
Trolox. Bastida et al. (7) reported extracts from carob fruit 
rich in condensed tannins which were successfully ap-
plied to reduce fat deterioration in cooked meat during 
chilled and frozen storage. Retardation of lipid oxidation 
by diff erent plants was demonstrated also using lotus leaf 
powder (0.1 and 0.5 %) in cooked ground pork (10). Simi-
lar results were shown with other natural antioxidants 
such as rosemary extracts (0.03 %) (1) or radix puerariae ex-
tracts (1 %) in precooked pork sausage (33).

Texture parameters of cooked pork batt er
The addition of tara pod powder to cooked pork bat-

ters reduced (p<0.05) texture parameters such as: hard-
ness, chewiness, gumminess and cohesion (Table 5) in 
comparison with control (without antioxidants and with 
added BHA) samples on days 1 and 14. Lipid and protein 
oxidation are closely associated deteriorative processes 
occurring in meat products during storage. It has been re-
ported that protein oxidation can negatively aff ect the 
sensory quality of meat products in terms of texture, ten-
derness and colour (34). Some authors have related an in-
crease in hardness of fresh pork during storage to higher 
intensity of protein oxidation reactions, leading to the for-
mation of crosslinking bonds and polymerisation in pro-
teins (35). Results suggest that tara pod powder may have 
reduced the hardness of cooked pork product through its 
protective role against oxidation. Furthermore, these re-
sults indicate that the addition of tara powder was effi  -
cient in preparing precooked pork products with soft er 
textural properties.

Cohesiveness measures the degree of diffi  culty in 
breaking down the internal structure of the sausage, 
while springiness represents the extent of recovery of 
sausage height and sometimes is referred to as elasticity 
(33). The springiness values of treated samples were con-
siderably lower (p<0.05) than that of the negative control 

on day 1, but aft er 14 days of chilled storage, the values in 
batt ers containing antioxidants (BHA or tara pod pow-
der) showed an increasing trend. The fi ndings observed 
by TPA were confi rmed by the sensory evaluation, where 
signifi cant diff erences in textural properties among 
cooked pork batt ers were identifi ed. Estevez et al. (36) 
also reported that the addition of natural antioxidants 
may enhance texture characteristics of emulsion-type 
meat products by reducing hardness, adhesiveness, gum-
miness and chewiness. Hayes et al. (4) found that the ap-
plication of lipid-soluble ingredients such as ellagic acid 
protected the muscle membrane from lipid oxidation and 
therefore reduced moisture loss, which in turn had an ef-
fect on the sausages textural properties.

Conclusions
The results presented here suggest that tara (Caesal-

pinia spinosa) pod powder is a potential source of natural 
antioxidants and can be successfully used to decrease lip-
id oxidation and improve the shelf life and colour stabili-
ty of cooked pork products in meat industry. In addition, 
from a nutritional point of view, the addition of a natural 
functional ingredient to cooked pork products can pro-
vide bioactive compounds (polyphenols) and it also ad-
dresses consumer demands for healthier functional food 
products.
