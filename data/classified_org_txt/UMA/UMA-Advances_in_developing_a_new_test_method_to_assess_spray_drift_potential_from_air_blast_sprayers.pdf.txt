Abstract
Drift is one of the most important issues to consider for realising sustainable pesticide sprays. This study proposes and tests 

an alternative methodology for quantifying the drift potential (DP) of air blast sprayers, trying to avoid the difficulties faced in 
conducting field trials according to the standard protocol (ISO 22866:2005). For this purpose, an ad hoc test bench designed 
for DP comparative measurements was used. The proposed methodology was evaluated in terms of robustness, repetitiveness 
and coherence by arranging a series of trials at two laboratories. Representative orchard and vineyard air blast sprayers in eight 
configurations (combination of two forward speeds, two air fan flow rates, and two nozzle types) were tested. The test bench 
was placed perpendicular to the spray track to collect the fraction of spray liquid remaining in the air after the spray process and 
potentially susceptible to drift out of the treated area. Downwind spray deposition curves were obtained and a new approach was 
proposed to calculate an index value of the DP estimation that could allow the differences among the tested configurations to be 
described. Results indicated that forward speed of 1.67 m/s allows better discrimination among configurations tested. Highest 
DP reduction, over 87.5%, was achieved using the TVI nozzles in combination with low air fan flow rate in both laboratories; 
conversely, the highest DP value was obtained with the ATR nozzles in combination with high air fan flow rate. Although the 
proposed method shows a promising potential to evaluate drift potential of different sprayer types and nozzles types used for bush 
and tree crops further research and tests are necessary to improve and validate this method.

Introduction

Spray drift remains a major problem in applying 
agrochemicals because the pesticides may get deposited 
in non-target areas outside of the treated field and pose 
risks to the environment and bystanders (Nuyttens et al., 
2007). One of the goals of the 128/2009/CE European 
Directive for Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EC, 2009) 
is spray drift reduction and improved efficiency of 
pesticide application. This new regulation includes the 
definition, establishment, and quantification of buffer 

zones on the basis of quantitative information about the 
spray drift potential of every sprayer and configuration. 
According to ISO 22866:2005 (ISO, 2005), spray drift 
is defined as ‘the quantity of plant protection product 
that is carried out of the sprayed (treated) area by the 
action of air currents during the application process’. 
In an orchard, this includes droplets which move 
horizontally through the orchard canopy and beyond 
the orchard as well as those which are above the tree 
leaf canopy (via direct spraying into the air or upward 
diffusion from the sprayed canopy) and move vertically

into the atmosphere. Most spray drift involves droplets 
which move above the canopy for a part of or their 
entire pathway (Miller et al., 2003).

Several studies have evaluated and quantified the 
effect of the different variables that strongly influenced 
spray drift; these factors may be categorised as 
follows: equipment and application techniques, spray 
characteristics, operator care and skill (Arvidsson 
et al., 2011), and environmental and meteorological 
conditions. Nevertheless, classifying spray techniques 
is challenging because these vary greatly due to the 
influence of environmental conditions and crop growth 
and leaf canopy status of different bush and tree crop 
types (Ozkan & Zhu, 1998; Zande et al., 2000, 2010; 
Balsari et al., 2007).

Spray drift assessments are typically mandatory in 
regulatory evaluations of plant protection products at 
the European, country, and zonal levels, and field trial 
results are commonly used for registration purposes 
(Rautmann et al., 2001; Zande et al., 2007). However, 
spray drift studies may be conducted with a range of 
different reference conditions (wind speed, nozzle 
height, temperature, humidity, etc.). Consequently, 
differences arise between assessments depending on 
the choice of standard reference conditions for tests 
(Huijsmans & Zande, 2011).

Recently, many studies have focused on spray drift 
measurements and the classification of the spray drift 
of field crop sprayers (Hewitt et al., 2001; Landers & 
Gil, 2006; Nuyttens et al., 2007; Baetens et al., 2009; 
Landers, 2010; Sehsah & Herbst, 2010). Researchers 
have proposed easy, repeatable, and precise methods as 
alternatives for spray drift measurement (Southcombe 
et al., 1997; Zande et al., 2002; Balsari et al., 2007; 
Nuyttens et al., 2009) based on spray drift potential. 

The difficulties faced in spray drift measurement 
using boom sprayers are even higher in the case of field 
evaluation trials in orchards and vineyard sprayers. The 
great heterogeneity of cultures (olive trees, vineyard, 
fruit orchards, citrus, etc.), important variations during 
the crop season with large modifications in the canopy 
size and density, wide options of plantation layout and 
relative training system, great variability in terms of 
spray technology, and influence of selected operational 
parameters during the application process (nozzle type, 
working pressure, forward speed, air assistance, etc.) 
make it much more difficult to establish an objective and 
widely applicable method for spray drift measurement 
in these situations (García-Ramos et al., 2009; Cunha 
et al., 2012; Gil et al., 2013; Salyani et al., 2013).

Irrespective of the large list of variables affecting 
spray drift during orchard spray application, it is 
necessary to evaluate and clarify the objectiveness, 
effectiveness, and repeatability of the actual ISO 

22866:2005 standard (ISO, 2005). Many problems 
were encountered during its application (Ravier et 
al., 2005; Llorens et al., 2016), being difficult to 
obtain objective and reproducible results even if all 
the stringent requirements were followed. Therefore, 
this study aims at developing and testing a possible 
alternative methodology for quantifying the spray 
drift potential in air blast sprayer applications to get 
objective results independent of the cultivar and canopy 
structure variations.

Material and methods

Technical characteristics of spray drift test bench

A test bench analogue to the one described in 
ISO22401:2015 (ISO, 2015), consisting in a metal frame 
equipped with slots to place artificial collectors and with 
a sliding cover actuated by a pneumatic system was used. 
The length of test the bench was 20.0 m, it was placed 
transverse to the sprayer’s forward direction, away from 
a concrete flat lane used as a tractor track (Fig. 1A). 
Artificial collectors with a capture area of 153.86 cm2 
(Petri dishes of 140-mm diameter) aligned in a single 
array transverse to the sprayer’s forward direction were 
placed at intervals of 0.5 m (±10 mm) along the test 
bench slots (Fig. 1B). The first collector (the one closest 
to the sprayer pass) was positioned at 1.5 m distance from 
the sprayer’s outer nozzle(s). The samplers’ position was 
0.25 m above the soil (±50 mm). All collectors were 
initially covered using the stainless steel sliding plates 
of the test bench. The sprayer started the application 20 
m before and stopped it 20 m after the position of the 
collector array. The actuator of the pneumatic system 
for opening the collectors was activated by the sprayer 
pass and it was placed at a relative distance from the 
test bench line, so that 4 s after the sprayer passed the 
perpendicular line of the bench the collectors were 
revealed. The time of 4 s for uncovering the test bench 
was defined based on preliminary experiences with the 
test bench for boom sprayers (Balsari et al., 2007; Gil et 
al., 2014) and air-assisted sprayers (Balsari et al., 2012, 
2014). All tests have to be conducted in condition of 
calm of wind (average wind speed < 0.5 m/s). Samples 
were collected 60 s after the opening of the system. 
Each Petri dish was then covered and placed in dry 
and dark conditions until the spray amount collected 
was determined.

To evaluate the functionality of the spray drift 
test bench and repeatability of the results, analogue 
trials were conducted both in Italy (DiSAFA facilities, 
University of Turin-) and Spain (DEAB facilities, 
Polytechnic University of Catalonia-).

Characteristics of air blast sprayers

Two different air blast sprayers, widespread and 
typically used in vineyard and orchard, were tested: 
(a) a mounted vineyard sprayer Dragone k2 500 
(Dragone S.n.c., Castagnole Asti, AT, Italy) fitted 
with a 200 L polyethylene tank, a tower-shaped air 
conveyor (height of the top box 1300 mm) with 
an axial fan (diameter: 600 mm) provided with 
a two-speed gearbox that enables the horizontal 
air flow rate to be varied from 11,000 to 20,000 
m3/h and equipped with 6 nozzles on each side 
of the sprayer (vertical nozzles spacing 180 mm 
and highest positioned nozzle 1250 mm); and (b) 
a trailed orchard sprayer Fede Qi 90 Futur 2000 
(Pulverizadores Fede S.L., Cheste, Valencia, 
Spain) equipped with a 2,000 L polyethylene 
tank, an axial fan (diameter: 900 mm) provided 
with a two-speed gearbox that enables the air 
flow rate to be varied from 29,000 to 46,000 m3/h 
and equipped with 13 nozzles on each side of the 
sprayer, positioned in two lines (6 in the first line 
and 7 in the second one).

Sprayer configurations

The Dragone k2 500 sprayer was tested in four 
configurations resulting from combining (a) two air 
fan settings (air flow rate: 11,000 and 20,000 m3/h) 
and (b) two nozzle types (conventional hollow 
cone ATR 80 orange and air induction, also called 
Venturi, hollow cone TVI 8002 manufactured by 
Albuz® CoorsTek, Evereux, France). The tests 

were performed at a working pressure of 1.0 MPa, 
and the nominal nozzle flow rates were 1.39 and 
1.46 L/min, respectively. During all the tests, only 
six nozzles on the sprayer side facing the test bench 
were used; the nozzles orientation and sprayer 
position (0.40 m above the ground, measured 
from the sprayer’s frame to the concrete flat lane) 
adopted were the same in both laboratories for all 
configurations and replicates tested. Furthermore, 
Fede Qi 90 Futur 2000 sprayer was tested by 
combining (a) two air fan settings (air flow rate: 
29,000 and 46,000 m3/h) and (b) two hollow cone 
nozzle types (conventional Albuz® ATR 80 red and 
air induction Albuz® TVI 80025). The tests were 
performed at a working pressure of 1.5 MPa, and 
the nominal nozzle flow rates were 2.33 L and 2.24 
L/min, respectively. During the tests, only eight 
nozzles at the central position of the two lines (i.e., 
four nozzles on each line) on the sprayer side facing 
the test bench were used; the nozzles orientation 
adopted was the same in both laboratories for all 
configurations and replicates tested.

For each thesis, five replicates of the tests were 
performed in each laboratory.

Influence of forward speed on spray drift 
potential

Although some field studies highlight that high 
forward speed during spray applications using boom 
sprayers increases both spray drift as well as the 
deposition (Gosh & Hunt, 1998; Dele et al., 2005) 
others, conducted in orchard, specifies that higher

forward speeds produce lower spray drift values due 
to the lower penetration of the air stream (bended 
backwards) through tree canopy (Triloff, 2015). 

So, in order to investigate if forward speeds affect 
the generation of spray drift plume suspended in the 
air over the test bench, enhancing the influence of 
different sprayer settings on potential spray drift risk, 
all sprayers configurations were tested at two forward 
speeds: low 0.83 m/s (3 km/h) and high 1.67 m/s 
(6 km/h -close to the real forward speed generally 
adopted during spray application in vineyards and 
orchards-). According to the different forward 
speeds the Specific Sprayer Output (SSO), that is the 
amount of liquid sprayed during 10 mm of advancing 
forward, varies. In accordance to the low and high 
forward speed adopted in the trials using Dragone 
k2 500, the SSO ranged from 1,668 to 834 µL/cm 
(one-sided based on) employing ATR type nozzles 
and from 1,752 to 876 µL/cm (one-sided based on) 
when TVI type nozzles were tested. Assuming a 
hypothetical vineyard layout featuring 2.5 m distance 
between the rows, the application volume rates 
ranged from 1,334 to 667 L/ha when conventional 
nozzles were employed and from 1,402 to 700 L/ha 
using air induction nozzles. For Fede Qi 90 Futur 
2000, the SSO ranged from 3,782 to 1,864 µL/cm of 
the sprayer advancing forward (one-sided based on) 
using ATR type nozzles and from 3,584 to 1,792 µL/
cm (one-sided based on) when TVI type nozzles were 
tested. In this case, assuming a hypothetical orchard 
layout featuring 4.5 m distance between the rows, the 
application volume rates ranged from 1,657 to 828 L/
ha using conventional nozzles and from 1,593 to 796 
L/ha using air induction nozzles. Table 1 summarises 
all tests performed in both laboratories (DEAB and 
DiSAFA).

Characterisation of nozzle droplet size spectrum

The droplet spectrum and its variation were 
determined for each nozzle type used in the trials. 
Laboratory measurements of the droplet sizes were 
performed at DiSAFA using a Malvern Spraytech 
(Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) 
laser diffraction instrument. For each nozzle type, 
three nozzles were randomly sampled from a batch 
and for each single nozzle three measurements 
were performed to determine the values of the 
10th-percentile (D[v,0.1]), 50th-percentile or 
volume median diameter (D[v,0.5]), 90th-percentile 
(D[v,0.9]), and V100 of each nozzle at the same 
pressure used in test bench trials: 1.0 MPa for ATR 
80 orange and TVI 8002, and 1.5 MPa for ATR 80 
red and TVI 80025.

Spray liquid and tracer concentration

Similar concentrations (5-6 g/L) of E-102 
tartrazine yellow dye tracer [85% (w/w)] were 
added into the tanks in both laboratories. The 
spray deposits were quantified washing artificial 
collectors with a definite amount of deionized 
water and analysing the obtained liquid using a 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Genesys 20 
in DEAB and Biochrom Lybra S11 in DiSAFA) 
set at a wavelength of 427 nm. Before each test, 
a blank sample procedure was arranged. Sprayed 
liquid were sampled directly from nozzles before 
and after the spraying process to determine the 
precise tracer concentration in the sprayed liquid in 
each test.

Weather conditions during trials

Wind speed and wind direction, with respect to 
the orientation of the spray track during the tests, 
were measured at 0.1 Hz frequency sampling 
rate. Also the air temperature and humidity were 
monitored during the tests. To record the weather 
conditions during the trials at DEAB’s facilities, 
an automatic weather station (WatchDog weather 
station Model 2550, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., 
USA) was used. The weather conditions during 
the tests conducted at DiSAFA were recorded 
using a sonic anemometer (Gill Windsonic, Gill 
Instruments Ltd., Lymington, UK) combined 
with a Campbell CR200X data logger (Campbell 
Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) and Testo 625 thermo-
hygrometer (Allemano Metrology, Torino, IT). In 
both laboratories, the weather devices were placed 
at 25 m distance downwind from the spray track (at 
the same side where the test bench was placed) at 2 
m height above the ground.

The weather conditions were recorded for each 
replicate only during the period that the sprayer was 
spraying, plus 60 s after (the time required to allow 
all droplets suspended in the air to sediment), and 
then averaged. For each replicate the monitored 
period corresponds to 108 s or 84 s respectively if 
low (3 km/h) or high (6 km/h) forward speed were 
tested.

Assessment of spray drift potential and drift 
potential value (DPV)

The deposit on each artificial collector 
(expressed in µL/cm2), was calculated according 
to the formula provided by ISO 22401:2015 (ISO, 
2015).

Once the amount of tracer on every single 
collector was measured, the DPV was calculated 
by the following equation:

where DPV is the drift potential value in µL/cm2 m; 
Di is the spray deposit on a single deposit collector, 
in µL/cm2; n is the number of collectors (40); and 
Coeff is a variable Coefficient calculated based on the 
cumulative deposition curve obtained from the spray 
deposit measured on every single collector. 

The Coeff value calculation includes the distance 
reached by the spray drift, and it is calculated as 
follows:

where Coeff is the variable Coefficient in m, and
Dstn *10 corresponds to the value equal to the distance in 
meters from the outer sprayer nozzle where n * 10 % of the 
cumulative spray drift deposit calculated is achieved (i.e., 
from 10% to 100% in intervals of 10%).

For example, Fig. 2 shows the visual pattern of two 
different cumulative deposition curves for two extreme 
and different spray applications tested and the related 
Coefficients used for the calculation. The higher the spray 

drift deposit accumulated close to the sprayer, the lower 
is the Coefficient applied in the calculation of the DPV. 

This proposed Coefficient for calculating the DPV 
is aimed at weighing the deposition in relation to the 
distance from the sprayer achieved and penalising 
spray drift which reaches a longer distance rather than 
a shorter one.

Calculation of spray drift reduction

The spray drift reduction value was calculated based 
on the DPVs according to ISO 22369-1:2006 (ISO, 
2006) formula, for each sprayer configuration at each 
laboratory. 

The configuration chosen as reference spray system 
for calculating the spray drift reduction was the one 
featured by conventional nozzles combined with the 
high fan air flow rate for both sprayers tested. Based 
on the preliminary assessment, it was considered 
appropriate to always analyse the dataset separately 
for each forward speed adopted in the trials.

2013). For each sprayer, the statistical differences 
among the DPVs of all tested configurations were 
evaluated using three-way Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) considering the laboratory, nozzle type, 
and fan air flow rate as a source of variation. The 
data were previously transformed (ln [DPV]) to 
achieve residual normality and homoscedasticity. 
Moreover, residuals analyses were also performed.

Results

Weather conditions during trials

For the DEAB tests, the average wind speed 
during all trials was 0.10 m/s, with a maximum 
value of 0.31 m/s. The temperature ranged from 
8°C to 20°C, and the relative humidity was between 
80% and 95%. For the DiSAFA trials, the average 
wind speed recorded during the tests was 0.51 
m/s, with a maximum value of 0.88 m/s. The air 
temperature ranged between 18°C and 29°C, and 
the relative humidity was between 40% and 80%. 
In both laboratories the average wind direction was 
always between 64° and 118° relative to the travel 
direction of the sprayer (prevalent lateral wind 
respect orientation of the spray track).

Nozzles droplets spectra characteristics

Both conventional nozzles ATR (orange and 
red) produce very fine droplets as classified by 
Southcombe et al. (1997) to ensure excellent 
coverage and to be easily transported by the air 
of the sprayer fan towards the tree canopy. Such 
fine droplets are more prone to drift as the size of 
droplets both in terms of D[v,0.1] and D[v,0.5] 
presented values below than 100 µm and the 
D[v,0.9] value resulted less than 200 µm, meaning 
that all three droplet size parameters fell within the 
200 µm threshold identified by Bouse et al. (1990) 
to indicate droplets more prone to drift (Table 
2). Both Venturi nozzles TVI (8002 and 80025) 
produced coarser (C-class) droplets (Table 2): all 
three parameters measured resulted larger than 
those measured on ATR nozzles, showing D[v,0.1] 
values higher than 100 µm.

Vineyard sprayer

Drift Potential Value (DPV). The ANOVA results 
show that in the trials conducted at a forward speed 
of 0.83 m/s (3 km/h) (Table 3), significant effects of 
all the main factors, namely, the laboratory, nozzle 
type, and fan air flow rate on DPV (p<0.05) were

A and B are the visual results of only one trial replicate, respectively for ATR6H and TVI6L configura-
tions, using vineyard sprayer; the coefficient and then DPV calculations were performed separately for 
each replicate (160 replicates in total considering all the configurations tested).

detected; in contrast, there were no significant effects 
of the interaction among the considered factors. 
At a forward speed of 1.67 m/s (6 km/h) (Table 3), 
significant effects of the nozzle type and fan air 
flow rate on the DPV were detected; however, the 
laboratory did not show a significant effect on the 
DPVs. The DPV results obtained at DEAB and at 
DiSAFA were not significantly different. At this 
forward speed, the mean DPV resulted respectively 
169 and 167 at DEAB and at DiSAFA laboratories.

DiSAFA) was more than three-fold that using the 
air induction nozzles -TVI8002- (71 for DEAB and 
60 for DiSAFA). This demonstrates the significant 
effect of using a low-drift nozzle (air induction) in 
reducing spray drift even in applications carried out 
without a target. Similarly, the use of a high fan air 

flow rate produced significantly higher DPVs (240 
for DEAB and 204 for DiSAFA) in comparison 
to a low air flow rate (98 for DEAB and 130 for 
DiSAFA) regardless the nozzle type. In general, both 
laboratories obtained very similar results when the 
sprayer was operated at a forward speed of 6 km/h.

In general, Fig. 3 shows that the low fan air flow 
rate, combined with each nozzle type tested, produced 
mean DPVs significantly lower than those obtained 
adopting the high air flow rate, irrespective of the 
forward speed and laboratory. Keeping the same 
fan setting, the DPV achieved using air induction 
nozzles -TVI8002- was lower than that obtained with 
conventional nozzles -ATR80orange-. At the same 
time, the larger differences were measured between the 
DPV standard errors of mean (SEM) obtained using the 
conventional nozzles with respect to those found with 
air induction nozzles. In the tests conducted at 3 km/h 
(Fig. 3), the DPVs obtained in the two laboratories were

not in agreement (i.e., the DPVs obtained at DEAB for 
each sprayer configuration was much lower than that 
obtained at DiSAFA). 

Spatial distribution of spray plume along the 
test bench. Figs. 4 and 5 respectively show the 
deposition curves obtained, in absence of target, 
for the configurations tested at the two laboratories 
using vineyard sprayer at 3 and 6 km/h. The greatest 
part of the deposition was located, in all cases, in 
the first few meters of the test bench; in particular, 
the deposition increases up to a peak positioned at 
a certain distance. When working at 3 km/h (), the 
peak position and the maximum amount of spray 
deposit measured along the test bench resulted 

different for the two laboratories. At a forward speed 
of 6 km/h, the deposition peak position was located 
within the first 5 m on the test bench regardless the 
sprayer configuration and the laboratory. After the 
peak, all the curves showed a progressive decrease 
of spray deposits along the test bench up to a distance 
of 16 m from the outer sprayer nozzle. However, 
the rate of decrease in the deposition as measured 
along the array of collectors varied depending on the 
sprayer configuration. In both laboratories, the rate 
of decrease was lower with conventional nozzles 
(ATR80orange) than with air induction nozzles 
(TVI8002). Furthermore, the use of a high air flow 
rate showed a slower decrease of spray deposits

measured on the collectors in comparison to the tests 
conducted at low air flow rate. It follows that the 
ATR6H configuration showed the highest deposition 
values considering the sum of deposition measured 
on the entire array of collectors placed on the test 
bench; the total deposition decreased in the following 
configuration order: ATR6L, TVI6H and TVI6L. 

Orchard sprayer

Drift Potential Value (DPV). As observed for the 
vineyard sprayer, the ANOVA results for the orchard 
sprayer also showed that significant differences 
(p<0.05) between laboratories were found at 3 km/h; 
however, no effect was found at 6 km/h (Table 4). 
The effects of the nozzle type and of the fan air flow 
rate on the DPVs were also studied. The tendency of 
DPVs resulted similar to that described for the vineyard 
sprayer. Regardless the fan air flow rate adopted, the 
mean of the DPV measured using conventional nozzles 
(422 for DEAB and 399 for DiSAFA) was more than 
six times greater than that observed employing air 
induction nozzles (62 for DEAB and 62 for DiSAFA). 
This confirmed the great effect of using a drift-reducing 
nozzle for reducing spray drift even in applications 
without a target. Similarly, the use of the high fan air 
flow rate produced significantly higher DPVs (336 
for DEAB and 331 for DiSAFA) in comparison to the 
low air flow rate setting (148 for DEAB and 114 for 
DiSAFA), regardless the nozzle type, as shown by other 
authors (Wenneker et al., 2005) showing similar results 
deriving from field trials (ISO22866) testing the effect 
of fan flow rates in combination with air induction 
nozzles.

In general, the tendency registered with the 
vineyard sprayer was confirmed testing orchard 
sprayer: low fan air flow rate, combined with each 
nozzle type tested, produced mean DPVs significantly 
lower than that obtained with high air flow rate, 
irrespective of the forward speed and laboratory 
(Fig. 6). The DPV measured employing the air 
induction nozzles (TVI80025) resulted lower than 
those achieved operating the conventional nozzles 
(ATR80red). Also in the case of the orchard sprayer 
when the tests were carried out at 3 km/h (Fig. 6), the 
DPVs obtained in the two laboratories showed some 
divergences (i.e., DPVs obtained at DEAB for each 
configuration was much higher than that obtained at 
DiSAFA). 

Spatial distribution of spray plume along the 
test bench. The variation in the deposits measured 
on the array of collectors placed transverse to the 
sprayer forward direction was plotted (Figs. 7 and 
8) for representing the spray plume generated by 

all configurations tested at the two laboratories at 3 
and 6 km/h. In general terms, a spray plume shape 
similar to that observed using the vineyard sprayer 
was achieved also employing the orchard sprayer: 
the greatest part of the spray deposition was located 
in the first few meters of the test bench, and the 
spray deposits measured on the test bench collectors 
increased up to a peak located at about 5 m from 
the outer sprayer nozzle (for tests made at a forward 
speed of 6 km/h). After the peak, all curves showed a 
progressive decrease along the distance up to 20.5 m 
from the outer sprayer nozzle. The tendency and rate 
decrease of deposits assessed along the test bench 
resulted similar in both laboratories, as already 
observed for the vineyard sprayer. Moreover, in 
this case, the SEM values of deposition on every 
single collector show better accuracy of the data at 
6 km/h. Additionally, as previously mentioned in 
the vineyard sprayer’s scatter plot analysis, at this 
forward speed, the SEM values of the deposition on 
each collector was higher for the configuration with 
conventional nozzles (ATR80red) than for that with 
air induction type nozzles (TVI80025).

Drift potential reduction

A comparison between the results obtained at 
DEAB and DiSAFA can be observed in, where the 
relative values of the spray drift reduction have 
been calculated based on the ATR3H (forward 
speed of 3 km/h) and ATR6H (forward speed of 
6 km/h) configurations as a reference sprayer 
(value = 0). Regardless the sprayer, forward speed, 
and laboratory, the highest spray drift reduction 
percentage was always achieved using the air 
induction nozzles (TVI) in combination with low 
fan air flow rate, followed by the configuration of air 
induction nozzles combined with high fan air flow 
rate and conventional nozzles (ATR) in combination 
with low fan air flow rate. Furthermore, for spray 
drift reduction values, the greatest divergences 
between the laboratories were found at a forward 
speed of 3 km/h regardless the sprayer.

Discussion

As proved previously for boom sprayers by Gil 
et al. (2014), the proposed ad hoc test bench is also 
promising for the spray drift potential evaluation of air 
blast sprayers. The described methodology enabled to 
discriminate different sprayer configurations.

A study of the DPVs suggests that for the 
assessment of the spray drift potential in vineyard

(Dragone k2 500) and orchard (Fede Qi 90 Futur 
2000) sprayers using the test bench, it is better 
to work at forward speeds of 6 km/h because it 
allows the effect of the evaluated setting parameter 
(nozzle type and fan air flow rate) to be identified 
clearly irrespective of the laboratories considered. 
Considering the spray deposition profile (Figs. 4 and 
7) obtained at 3 km/h forward speed, the differences 
between laboratories are due to the setting time of 
automatically opening the collectors: the sprayer 
covers half the distance compared to that covered at 
a speed of 6 km/h during the established test bench 
opening time of 4 s. Using a constant time for opening 
the test bench, at low forward speed, the sprayer fan 
is closer to the test bench when the collectors are 
revealed, strongly affecting the level of the spray drift 
deposition measured on it and in turn influencing the 
DPVs. On the other hand, when working at 6 km/h 
(Figs. 5 and 8), the relative differences observed 
among the profiles obtained at the two laboratories 
could be attributed principally to the environmental 
conditions during the trials. In fact, the variability of 
the obtained results at 6 km/h, represented by SEM 
values of deposition on each collector, was always 
lower in comparison to that obtained at 3 km/h for 
each sprayer configuration. The accuracy of the data 
obtained for each collector in the tests at 6 km/h 
could be an indicative parameter of the goodness of 
the proposed method for spray drift evaluation.

Considering the DPVs (Figs. 3 and 6) and the relative 
spray drift reduction (Table 5) obtained at 6 km/h, both 
sprayers show good similarity in the tendency of the 
obtained results at DEAB and DiSAFA, especially 
for the two configurations with the air induction 
nozzles (TVI: TVI6H and TVI6L). The configurations 
provided with conventional nozzles (ATR) showed 
greater divergences, variability among replicates, in 
both laboratories (ATR6H and ATR6L). The larger 
differences between SEM of the DPVs obtained using 
the conventional nozzles suggest that the variability 
of the measured data is linked to the higher fraction 
of small droplets, mainly prone to drift (V100 equal 
to 50.45% for ATR 80 orange and 57.64% for ATR 80 
red, Table 2) as described by Zande et al. (2008; 2012) 
and Gil et al. (2014), who assumed a linear relationship 
between V100 and spray drift. This was also confirmed 
by orchard field spray drift measurements performed 
by Michielsen et al. (2009). Additionally, information 
about the influence of the droplet size spectrum on 
DPVs was obtained by analysing the gap between the 
DPVs obtained using ATR nozzles and those achieved 
using TVI nozzles: the DPVs were six-fold higher using 
the Fede Qi 90 Futur 2000 sprayer and three-fold higher 
using the Dragone k2 500 sprayer. In absence of target, 

the aforementioned magnitude could be in part ascribed 
to the influence of the axial fan diameter that produce 
different air flow volumes (Table 1). With the bigger 
axial fan mounted on the Fede Qi 90 Futur sprayer, 
higher spray drift potential was measured.

Furthermore, although the tests were conducted 
outdoor nearly in absence of environmental wind 
(all the parameters recorded in both laboratories 
were in agreement with the environmental condition 
requirement of ISO 22401:2015 standard), as already 
demonstrated in a previous study (Gil et al., 2015), 
little changes in wind direction could strongly affect the 
spatial distribution of the spray deposition recovered 
along the entire bench and affect the DPVs themselves. 
As described by Ozkan & Zhu (1998), changes in wind 
velocity, air temperature, and relative humidity had 
much greater influence on the spray drift distances of 
fine droplets (< 100 µm diameter) than on larger droplets 
(> 200 µm diameter). So the difference between the 
laboratories in terms of the relative humidity and wind 
temperature could also affect the spray drift deposition

and shape of the distribution along the test bench. These 
aspects become prominent when using conventional 
nozzles (ATR).

Simplifying, the differences obtained between 
laboratories could be due to the variable effect of some 
external technical and environmental factors during 
the tests; these factors interact during the trials and 
influence the spray drift deposition (i.e., type of tractor 
used and weather conditions). In agreement with other 
authors (Hewitt et al., 2001; Hofman & Solseng, 2001), 
the degree of influence of the external and internal 
(equipment and application technique) technical factors 
is directly linked to the liquid properties and nozzle 
design (droplet size distribution) with the applied 
pressure. In fact, the spray drift reduction values 
obtained using the TVI nozzles that produce very 
coarse droplets, irrespective of the fan air flow rate 
used and sprayer, differ between the two laboratories 
by not more than 5% (forward speed 6 km/h). On the 
contrary the drift reduction values obtained using ATR 
nozzles in combination with low fan flow rate differ 
between laboratories by more than 20% (ATR6H 

configuration used as reference). The fine droplets 
produced by the ATR nozzles (V100 equal to 50.45% 
and 57.64% respectively for ATR 80 orange and red), 
than those produced by TVI (V100 equal to 2.42% and 
5.59% respectively for TVI 8002 and 80025), were 
strongly influenced by the framework condition even if 
in absence of environmental wind (average wind speeds 
less than 0.5 m/s). These combined effects, framework 
conditions and droplets spectra characteristics, result 
in a higher difference between the spray drift 
reduction values obtained in the two laboratories 
using conventional nozzles than using air induction 
nozzles (Table 5).

Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the similar 
tendency in spray drift potential reduction achieved 
in both laboratories depending on the configuration 
tested using the two types of sprayers (forward speed 
6 km/h). This is in agreement with other studies that 
showed that the measurements of the fall-out drift 
can, in some cases, differ by as much as a factor of 
10 for the same nozzle size and working pressure both 
for air blast sprayers (Zande et al., 2012) and for boom

sprayers (Arvidsson et al., 2011). This difference could 
be attributed to weather conditions, spray application 
technology, and different measurement procedures 
(Nuyttens et al., 2006).

Despite the influence of external and technical 
factors, the newly proposed DPV test methodology 
and calculation, based on the results obtained from 
experimental data, can discriminate among different 
sprayer configurations. In fact, the Coefficient used 
in DPV calculation allows configurations featured by 
the same total deposition but with different shapes of 
deposition along the distance to be discriminated. This 
is important because the shape of deposition along the 
test bench is directly linked to the configuration tested, 
and the DPV calculation method provided can take into 
account, along the whole test bench, the distance at 
which a specific amount of spray is deposited and how 
the total amount is distributed.

Considering that it is impossible to achieve standardised 
and identical environmental test conditions during 
outdoor trials, it is necessary to define a reference sprayer 
in terms of setting (i.e., type of nozzle, operating pressure, 
volume of air flow rate) and type (i.e., mounted, trailed, 
axial fan, individual air output) for each crop type (i.e., 
orchard, vineyards, olive tree, citrus, hops, nursery tree 
plantation) to perform a useful evaluation of the spray drift 
reduction achieved by Spray Drift Reducing Technology 
(SDRT) tested. This has already been defined for boom 
sprayers according to ISO 22369-2:2010 (ISO, 2010). 
This is in line with the requirements of ISO 22866:2005 
(ISO, 2005) and ISO 22369-1:2006 (ISO, 2006) for the 
comparative measurements. This means that for each 
country or region, it could be possible to define a different 
reference sprayer type and settings according to the most 
representative agricultural practice adopted in that region. 
This criteria is already adopted in the Netherlands, where 
the reference technique used for orchard spraying is a 
Munckhof cross-flow fan sprayer equipped with Albuz 
ATR lilac nozzles (Wenneker & Zande, 2008; Zande et 
al., 2008; Doruchowski et al., 2009; Michielsen et al., 
2009; Wenneker et al., 2015) and, which produces a very 
fine spray at 7 bar operating pressure (Southcombe et al., 
1997), combined with the high fan gear box setting as in 
orchard trees full leaf situation.

The preliminary studies on developing a new test 
method to assess potential spray drift introduce a simple 
procedure for assessing the DPV and spray drift potential 
reduction of air blast sprayer in absence of target. The 
great diversity of plant species, they planting, training 
systems, different dimension (shape and density of the 
trees canopies) which are changing during the season, 
make it difficult to establish the objective classification 
and ranking of SDRTs to be tested. Therefore, on the basis 
of these trials, the proposed layout of a spray drift test 

bench, primarily developed for boom sprayers, and the 
new method of DPV calculation give an opportunity 
for the measurements of spray drift potential of air blast 
sprayers independent of tree canopy characteristics 
in an easy and quickly way. However not negligible 
differences were assessed between laboratories and big 
variability was observed among sediment drift curves, 
especially at lower forward velocity of the sprayer. 
These evidences underline the necessity of future 
focused studies to find the source of variability of the 
results and to make a more robust proposed method.

Nowadays, further studies are undergoing to 
properly setting the opening time of the test bench as a 
function of the sprayer forward speed tested, because 
DPV and spray drift reduction needs to be evaluated at 
usual application speeds (not only at 6 km/h). It will 
be also useful to investigate the suitability of the test 
bench to detect the spray drift potential risk from further 
types of air blast sprayers (i.e. pneumatic and cross 
flow fan sprayers). Moreover, air blast sprayers studies 
are underway to compare the spray drift potential risk 
obtained using the test bench (indirect spray drift 
assessment method) and the spray drift risk obtained 
by applying the ISO 22866:2005 (ISO, 2005) field 
test method (direct spray drift assessment method), as 
already done to check the efficacy and reliability of 
others indirect spray drift assessment methods used for 
boom sprayers (Nuyttens et al., 2010, 2014).
