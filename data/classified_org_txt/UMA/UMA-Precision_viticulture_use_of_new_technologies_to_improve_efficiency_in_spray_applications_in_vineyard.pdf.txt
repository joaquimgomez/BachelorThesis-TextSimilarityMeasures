ABSTRACT 

 

Two different spray application methods were compared in three vine varieties and different crop 

stages. A conventional spray application with a constant volume rate per unit ground area (l•ha-

1) was compared with a variable rate application method designed to compensate electronically 

measured variations of canopy dimensions. An air-blast sprayer with individual multi-nozzle 

spouts was fitted up with three ultrasonic sensors and three electro-valves in one side, to modify 

the emitted flow rate of the nozzles according to the variability of canopy dimensions in real 

time. The purpose of this prototype was to precisely apply the required amount of spray liquid 

and avoid over and under dosing. On average, 58% savings in application volume was achieved 

with variable rate method, with similar or even better values of leaf deposit. In all cases the 

variable rate method guarantee a large number of leaves with deposits over the intended 

theoretical deposit threshold.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 

Crop-adapted dosing of agrochemicals has been widely discussed in many publications 

(Walklate et al., 2003; Furness, 2003; Gil et al., 2005; Godyn et al., 2005; Viret et al., 2005; 

Pergher and Petris, 2008). In all cases the main goal has been to adapt the total amount of PPP to 

crop characteristics but difficulties were encountered to select the most suitable crop parameter. 

The high degree of variability in crop variables has increased the difficulty in obtaining general 

solutions well adapted to all crops and situations.  

The use of orchard canopy volume as a basis for chemical application rate calculation and 

system design was discussed and tested by Sutton and Unrath (1984 and 1988). The tree row 

volume concept maintains that chemical rate recommendation and application should be based 

upon crop canopy volume rather than on land area. Following this methodology other trials have 

been conducted in order to adapt the spray volume to crop dimensions in vineyard (Pergher and 

Petris, 2008; Siegfried et al., 2007). In all cases accurate measurements of crop dimensions turns

into a key factor for the final success. The use of electronic devices to measure crop dimensions 

is not a new idea. McConnell et al. (1983) proposed the use of a system with a vertical mast with 

range transducers to measure tree extension, from the trunk outward and towards the row middle. 

More recently (Giles et al., 1989) using a modified orchard air-blast sprayer equipped with three 

ultrasonic transducers concluded that saving in pesticide application when using the electronic 

control system was strongly related to target crop architecture. Same authors concluded that 

sprayer control based upon target measurement, rather than simple target detection resulted in 

substantial increases in savings of applied spray liquid. 

Both to solve the encountered difficulties for crop characterization and to accomplish the recent 

EU trends aiming to reduce the total amount of PPP (COM, 2006), environmentally safe 

spraying techniques have been developed to spray only when and where needed with reduced 

losses to the environment ((Doruchowski and Holownicki, 2000). Recent advances in computer 

hardware and software, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), canopy sensors and remote 

sensing offer opportunities for fast and inexpensive measurements of tree canopy characteristics 

for variable rate technologies (VRT) (Zaman and Salyani, 2004). Walklate et al. (2006) using a 

LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) concluded that area-density and height adjustments were 

the best crop structure parameters on which a simplified scheme for pome fruit spraying could be 

based on. Rosell et al. (2009) developed a LIDAR-based measurement system for the estimation 

of physical and structural characteristics of plants (tree volume, leaf area density and leaf area 

index). The different shapes, sizes and foliar densities found in tree crops during the same 

growing season, require a continuous adjustment of the applied dose rate to optimize the spray 

application efficiency and to reduce environmental contamination (Solanelles et al., 2002). 

Target detection has been developed either by using advanced techniques, such a vision systems 

and laser scanning, or by ultrasonic and spectral systems. Gil et al. (2007) obtained a significant 

reduction in the total amount of applied volume (57%) using a sprayer prototype with ultrasonic 

sensors able to measure the crop width variations and to apply a variable dose rate according to 

the instantaneous measured vine row volume (VRV), in comparison with a conventional and 

constant application volume rate. However, this reduction did not affect the results in terms of 

deposit, leaf coverage and penetration where similar normalized values were achieved. 

Whitney et al. (2002) investigated the ultrasonic transducer’s response to different parts of a 

citrus canopy and also examined the effect of the sampling frequency and the transducer spacing 

on canopy volume determination. More recently (Balsari et al., 2008) using a crop identification 

system based on ultrasonic sensors confirmed its suitability to detect canopy characteristics in 

real time, independently of the forward speed, as previous studies already indicated (Zaman and 

Salyani, 2004). 

It seems that any approach to adapt the spraying volume rate to crop characteristics will lead 

with a general principle that foliar application must results in similar deposits independently of 

crop size or canopy density. That system would avoid over or under-dosage of PPP, a common 

situation especially in orchards and vineyards where in most cases pesticide dose rate is 

calculated in a per unit ground area basis (l•ha
-1

). 

This paper describes the characteristics of a developed sprayer prototype able to automatically 

adapt the spray application rate according to the target geometry, using an adapted tree-row-

volume (TRV) estimation method (Pergher and Petris, 2008; Rüegg et al., 1999). Results in 

terms of coverage, deposit and leaf recovery have been compared with these obtained with a 

conventional method based on a per land surface dosage system. In order to evaluate the

influence of the cultivar, research trials have been conducted in three representative vineyards 

(cv. Merlot, cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and cv. Tempranillo) and at different growth stages. 

 

2. OBJECTIVES 
 

The objectives of this study were as follows: 

 

a) to analyze the ability of ultrasonic sensors in the determination of vineyard structure; 
b) to investigate the spray volume savings achieved through the use of a target measurement 

sprayer control system based on the instantaneous vine volume, iVV (an adapted VRV 

principle); 

c) to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed spraying system, in comparison with the 
conventional application based on land surface; 

d) to determine the relationship between spray volume savings and canopy structure. 
 

3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 
2.1 Sprayer design 

 

The development and testing of the target measurement and sprayer control system used in this 

research have been previously described and discussed (Gil et al., 2007) and will only be briefly 

outlined in this article. The measurement system and the electronic process unit were mounted 

on an air-blast orchard sprayer (Hardi LE-600 BK/2 with a centrifugal fan of 400 mm diameter). 

The sprayer was equipped with six individual and adjustable spouts (three on each side of the 

machine) in which up to five nozzles could be arranged on each one.  A mast was fitted up on its 

left side to hold three ultrasonic sensors and a solenoid high frequency electro valve was placed 

before each of the three spouts linked to each ultrasonic sensor. The three sensor and electro 

valves were connected to the central control unit placed on the rear top of the sprayer on which a 

purpose developed software based on LabVIEW (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, 

USA) was used to transform the crop width measured by each sensor into flow rate at every 

nozzle set (figure 1).

2.1. Flow chart and system management process 

The system starts to run when the control unit is turned on (figure 2) and prompts the 

introduction of the specific spraying parameters related to crop characteristics (row width, 

application coefficient, forward speed and maximum crop height). The data acquisition process 

begins to receive information from ultrasonic sensors (Vin) and from the electronic flow meter 

installed on the system. All data is then managed and processed in the control unit, where signals 

obtained from each one of the ultrasonic sensors is transformed into canopy volume and to 

voltage (Vout) to send the corresponding electro valve. Previously a laboratory calibration of each 

ultrasonic sensor and each electro valve was performed in order to accurately determine the 

relationship between measured crop width (Cw) and electrical signals (Vin) from ultrasonic 

sensors, as well as the relationship between received voltage for each electro valve (Vout) and 

flow rate delivered (qu). 

Once the distance (xs) has been determined by each ultrasonic sensor, and the range readings 

converted to crop width (Cw), the system transforms those values into the nozzle flow rate (qu) 

according to equation [1], in order to apply a variable amount of liquid proportionally to the vine 

row variations:

2.3 Experimental plots 

 

Experiments were conducted in three different grape varieties (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and 

Tempranillo) and in two different growth stages (75 and 85 according to the BBCH-scale (Meier, 

2001). In all cases a total length of at least 100 m of five rows were sprayed (1,500 m
2
 of 

experimental plot), and sample leaves for deposit measurements were only taken from the three 

different blocks randomly established in the center row. On every block, a sample of 1 m length 

of row was established, on which plants were divided into four different zones according to 

height (every 0.40 m, ranging from 0.40 m to 1.60 m), and three zones according to depth within 

the crop (I: external left, II: centre; and III: external right).  

 

2.4. Treatments 

 

A set of tests was arranged on each variety and growth stage in order to compare the efficiency 

of application of the variable rate system with a conventional spraying procedure based on a 

constant application volume rate (l•ha
-1

) selected on each situation according to the usual rates in 

the area and growth stage. For the variable rate system, the application coefficient of i = 0.095

 vegetation was maintained in all cases. This application rate was selected according to 

previous research (Gil, 2001) where interest and benefits of this value in terms of efficacy and 

efficiency of applications were demonstrated.

4. RESULTS  
 

4.1 Savings 

 

According to the application rate adjusted for every individual test, table 1 shows the individual 

and average saving of liquid for all varieties and crop stages. In all cases saving values are 

greater than 40%, with the highest value for cv. Tempranillo (77%) in the last growth stage 

(BBCH-scale 85). In this particular situation, some prune action before the test probably affected 

the measurements obtained by the sensors, increasing the distance to the crop and reducing 

substantially the applied volume (86 l•ha
-1

) compared to previous applications, whereas 

conventional application volume rate was increased according to the normal procedure in the 

area.

Those values give an important possibility to reduce the total amount of PPP and its interest is 

even higher if this analysis is made together with the obtained results in terms of deposit on 

leaves (table 2), where statistically differences can be observed in all cases in favour of the 

variable rate application method, except for cv. Merlot.

4.2 Efficiency 

 

Efficiency of applications has been estimated by relating the individual leaf deposit obtained on 

each sample, dn (according equation [2]) with the theoretical expected deposit for each individual 

test, dtn (obtained with equations [3] and [4]):

In order to simulate the real circumstances during the spray application process, 80% of this 

value (0.8 x dtn) has been adopted as an objective threshold and for any individual test. 

According to that, a detailed analysis of the distribution of sample frequencies was conducted in 

order to quantify the relative amount of leaf samples that achieved that threshold value. Figure 3 

shows the cumulative frequency of leaf samples for all individual varieties and crop stages. It is 

interesting to remark that in all cases variable rate applications gave higher cumulative 

frequencies of leaf samples with deposition over the threshold value. Remarkable results have 

been obtained at the earlier crop stage (BBCH-75) in cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and cv. 

Tempranillo, with the greatest amount of leaf samples (41.9%) achieving the intended threshold. 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 

Even in uniform vineyards, important differences can be observed in crop width and thus in 

canopy volume along the line. The use of electronic systems capable to determine these 

differences in real time and the ability to adjust the working parameters according to these 

variations is an interesting way to achieve savings in the total amount of sprayed pesticides. 

The use of ultrasonic sensors together with variable rate electro-valves and the corresponding 

software for automation, made possible a real time modification of the sprayed flow rate 

according to the canopy volume. This allowed a significant reduction in sprayed volume while 

maintaining coverage and penetration rates similar or even better to conventional methods. 

Ultrasonic sensors and its measurements of crop canopy allow achieving tracer deposits 

according to leaf distribution in the crop profile. This fact is extremely important in order to 

obtain leaf deposits values close to the intended threshold. 

The electronic prototype must be improved in order to avoid the negative effect of tractor 

deviation from the center of the row and to increase the regulating range.

maintaining as the main goal increasing pesticide savings and improving liquid distribution 

according to the crop characteristics.
