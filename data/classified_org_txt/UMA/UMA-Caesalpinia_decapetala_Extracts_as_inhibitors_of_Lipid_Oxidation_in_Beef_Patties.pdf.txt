Abstract: In this study we investigated the effects of Caesalpinia decapetala (CD) extracts 

on lipid oxidation in ground beef patties. Plant extracts and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) 

were individually added to patties at both 0.1% and 0.5% (w/w) concentrations. We assessed 

the antioxidant efficacy of CD by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and 

evaluated their potential as natural antioxidants for meat preservation by thiobarbituric  

acid reactive substance (TBARS) values, hexanal content, fatty acid composition and color 

parameters. These were tested periodically during 11 days of refrigerated storage. TBARS 

levels were significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) in the samples containing plant extracts or BHT 

than in the non-treated control. In addition, the beef patties formulated with the selected plant 

extracts showed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) better color stability than those without antioxidants. 

These results indicate that edible plant extracts are promising sources of natural antioxidants 

and can potentially be used as functional preservatives in meat products.

1. Introduction 

Lipid oxidation, one of the major causes of quality deterioration, is also important because it can 

negatively affect sensory attributes such as color, texture, odor, and flavor as well as the nutritional quality 

of the product. Meat mincing, cooking and other processing prior to refrigerated storage disrupt muscle 

cell membranes facilitating the interaction of unsaturated lipids with pro-oxidant substances such as  

non-hemeiron, accelerating lipid oxidation leading to rapid quality deterioration and development of 

rancidity. Initially lipid oxidation in meat products results in a cardboard flavor and progresses with the 

development of painty, rancid and oxidized flavors [1]. 

Antioxidants are substances that at low concentrations retard the oxidation of easily oxidizable 

biomolecules, such as lipids and proteins in meat products, thus improving the shelf life of products by 

protecting them from deterioration caused by oxidation [2]. 

Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 

tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and propyl gallate (PG) have been used as antioxidants in meat and 

poultry products, but synthetic antioxidants have fallen under scrutiny due to potential toxicological 

effects [2]. 

Natural extracts have been developed in response the recent demand for natural products and 

consumers’ willingness to pay significant premiums for natural foods. Many plants have been recognized 

as possessing antioxidant activity, including barks of cinnamon (Cinnamomum iners), buds of clove 

(Syzygium aromaticum Linn), rhizomes of ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.), leaves of green tea 

(Camellia sinensis) and leaves of thyme (Thymus vulgaris Linn.) [3]. 

C. decapetala (Roth) Alston is a climbing shrub that belongs to the genus Caesalpinia of the Fabaceae 

family. C. decapetala (Roth) Alston is widely distributed around the world, but mainly distributed in the 

southern regions of the Yangtze River in China. The plant is locally known as “Yan wang ci” in Guizhou 

Province, China. The roots of C. decapetala (Roth) Alston are used in folk medicine to treat bronchitis, 

prevent colds, and as an antimalarial agent. Previous chemical investigations on C. decapetala (Roth) 

Alston revealed that the main chemical components were terpenoids and flavonoids [4]. Recently, the 

chemical constituents of C. decapetala (Roth) Alston have been systematically investigated and the 

antitumor activities of the compounds have been tested to validate the medicinal use of C. decapetala 

(Roth) Alston. C. decapetala has been shown to contain antioxidants. The leaves of C. decapetala contain 

cassane diterpenoid, caesaldecan, spathulenol, 4,5-epoxy-8(14)-caryophyllene, squalene, lupeol, resveratrol, 

quercetin, astragalin and stigmasterol [5]. 

Our objective in this study was therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of C. decapetala extract in 

preventing or reducing lipid oxidation as well as color changes in ground beef patties during storage at 

a chilled temperature (4 °C). 

2. Results and Discussion 

2.1. Antioxidant Capacity Assays (AOC) 

AOC determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay at 24 h and after 11 days are 

presented in Figure 1. In order to obtain an accurate value for the total antioxidant activity (Table 1), 

both the hydrophylic and lipophilic antioxidant activity analyses were done on the same samples.

Results of sample concentrations (µmol Trolox/mL sample) are expressed as mean (SD). Different letters (a–d) 

in the same column denote significant differences among samples (p ˂ 0.05). 

The hydrophylic and lipophilic antioxidant activity values were higher in the sample containing  

C. decapetala leaf extract (0.5%). The hydrophylic antioxidant activity (0.20 ± 0.003 mol Trolox 

equivalent/mL sample) had a higher value than the lipophilic FRAP value with no significant difference 



Molecules 2015, 20 13916 

 

 

(p ˂ 0.05) from the sample of BHT (0.21 ± 0.01 mol Trolox equivalent/mL sample). The sample with 

the lowest antioxidant activity as expected was the control. 

The FRAP value is a measure of the capacity of the antioxidant to reduce Ferric (III) ions to Ferrous (II) 

ions [6]. In our study the final hydrophylic and lipophilic values of antioxidant activity of the sample 

containing C. decapetala (0.5%) were higher than those reported by Topuz et al. [7]. They studied the 

effect of addition of sauces containing olive oil and pomegranate juice into marinated anchovy to retain 

the initial quality, by preventing undesired chemical and oxidative alterations during storage at 4 °C. 

The total antioxidant activity value of CD2 (0.39 ± 0.03) was similar to those (0.31 ± 0.05) reported by 

Bubonja-Sonje et al. [8]. 

The antioxidant activity of the hydrophylic and lipophilic extracts can be attributed to different 

antioxidants. The hydrophylic extract contains antioxidants such as phenolic derivatives of benzoic  

acid (gallic acid) and cinnamic acid or flavonoids [9]. In the lipophilic extract the major contributors to 

the antioxidant activity are hydrophobic compounds such as carotenoids, tocopherols, polymeric 

proanthocyanidins and high molecular weight tannins [10]. 

The extracts showed a higher ability to reduce Fe3+. The assay showed higher AOC values in the 

assay carried out with the lipophilic extract compared to the values for the hydrophylic extract. 

2.2. Effects on Metmyoglobin Formation 

The effect of C. decapetala and BHT on MetMB percentage in beef patties is presented in Figure 2. 

The relative MetMb percentage increased with time for the 11 days of refrigerated storage. The samples 

treated with leaf extract and BHT had a lower (p < 0.05) concentration of MetMb compared to the 

control, thus demonstrating some ability to inhibit formation of MetMb. After 10 days, the control sample 

exhibited higher MetMb concentration (73.48 ± 0.20). No significant difference was found between the 

control and sample CD 1 0.1%. Antioxidant effect was best in samples containing leaf herb extract 

(66.57% ± 0.3% for C. decapetala at 0.5%). The sample with BHT had a very similar behavior to the 

CD2 extract, with no significant difference between these samples at the end of the study. 

Although many factors can influence the color stability of meat and meat products, the susceptibility 

of myoglobin to autoxidation is a predominant factor. The discoloration of meat from red to brown during 

storage results from the oxidation of OxyMb to MetMb [11]. 

The radical species produced during muscle phospholipid oxidation may act to promote OxyMb 

autoxidation. Conversely, superoxide anion released from oxidized OxyMb can dismutate to hydrogen 

peroxide and hydroxyl radical, which are potent lipid pro-oxidants [11]. The free radical scavenging 

effects of phenolic compounds occurring in C. decapetala leaf extract are the most likely reason for the 

retardation of MetMb formation. 

In a previous study, Sánchez et al. [12] reported that beef patties treated with rosemary did not exceed 

40% of metmyoglobin after day 8 of storage. Significant correlations (95%) were observed between 

metmyoglobin formation and values from the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay. This 

confirms that both parameters reflect the oxidation rate for the samples during the study period, showing 

the control as the most oxidized sample. The addition of 0.5% C. decapetala was effective in inhibiting 

myoglobin oxidation and maintained the redness of the beef patties due to its ability to maintain 

oxymyoglobin stability, and to reduce the formation of metmyoglobin.

metmyoglobin changes in beef patties during 11 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Results 

are given as mean ± standard error. Different letters in the same day (a–c) indicate significant 

differences between samples. 

2.3. Volatile Compounds 

The hexanal content increased together with the TBARS values, thereby suggesting lipid oxidation 

development (Figure 3). The hexanal content of meat stored at 4 °C increased rapidly over the first four 

days of storage. The trend observed for hexanal values was as follows (p ˂ 0.05): control ˃ CD1 ˃ CD2 = 

BHT. The antioxidant herb extract added to beef patties reduced the amounts of volatile compounds 

formed. After eight days, the control and CD1 sample showed the highest hexanal concentration 

throughout the storage period. CD2 (0.5%) extract and BHT samples, which also had the lowest TBARS 

values, formed the least volatiles with 7.16 ± 0.1 and 6.89 ± 0.1 ppm hexanal, respectively. 

Flavor and aroma compounds found in meat include a broad array of compounds, including hydrocarbons, 

aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, furans, thiophenes, pyrroles, pyrazines, oxazoles, thiazoles, and sulfurous 

compounds. Also, flavor and aroma are attributes most easily detected and assessed by consumers as 

either acceptable or not [13]. 

Aldehydes are the most prominent volatiles produced during lipid oxidation and have been used to 

successfully follow lipid oxidation in meat or meat products where they are reported to contribute to  

the overall off-flavor of oxidized meat. Hexanal is reported to be the most sensitive indicator for  

lipid oxidation [14]. Hexanal and heptanal are degradation products from the oxidation of long chain 

polyunsaturated fatty acids n − 6, mainly linoleic acid [15]. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are 

known to be less stable towards oxidation than monounsaturated fatty acids, and the high hexanal values 

observed in this study can be attributed to degradation of linoleic acid.

concentration and BHT packaged in a modified atmosphere and stored at 5 °C. Results are 

given as mean ± standard error. Different letters in the same day (a–d) indicate significant 

differences between samples. 

Similar observations have been also made by Juntachote et al. [16] in cooked ground pork sausages 

with various added antioxidants. Sampaio et al. [17] indicated that natural antioxidants including honey, 

oregano and sage exhibited greater antioxidant efficacy than that shown by BHT, when assessed by 

hexanal formation. 

2.4. Effect on Lipid Oxidation and the Color of Beef Patties 

2.4.1. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS) Value 

The antioxidant effects of C. decapetala leaf extracts and the synthetic antioxidant BHT in ground 

beef patties (0.1% and 0.5%, w/w) are shown in Figure 4. The extracts showed effective antioxidant 

activity against lipid oxidation, although the TBARS content of the patties treated with edible plant 

extract (0.5%) was lower than that of the patties treated with BHT. As expected, the TBARS values of 

the control sample increased most by 5.6 mg malondialdehyde/kg sample after 11 days, whereas the 

TBARS values of patties containing 0.1% and 0.5% C. decapetala extract increased by 2.9 and 1.7 mg 

malondialdehyde/kg sample, respectively, after 11 days—significantly less than the control (p < 0.05). 

The ethanolic extract of C. decapetala was moderately antioxidant at both 0.1% and 0.5% in beef 

patties, with significantly lower (p < 0.05) TBARS values than the control, and the concentration 0.5% 

was more effective as an antioxidant than BHT treatment. We concluded that a 0.5% C. decapetala leaf 

extract is more capable than BHT of maintaining lipid stability and efficiently delaying lipid oxidation 

in refrigerated beef patties. 



Molecules 2015, 20 13919 

 

 

 

Figure 4. Effects of two concentrations of Caesalpinia decapetala added at 0.1% and 0.5% 

(w/w) and BHT added at 0.01% (w/w) on TBARS value (mg of malondialdehyde equivalent/kg 

of sample) of raw beef patties during 11 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Results are 

given as mean ± standard error. Different letters in the same day (a–d) indicate significant 

differences between samples. 

Our results are consistent with various other studies, all of which reported that natural antioxidants 

from culinary herbs and edible plants were effective at controlling lipid oxidation and extending the shelf 

life of meat products. Fasseas et al. [18] reported that both oregano essential oil (3%) and sage essential 

oil (3%) significantly reduced oxidation. Mitsumoto et al. [19] reported that adding tea catechins (200 

or 400 mg/kg) to minced meat inhibited lipid oxidation in both raw and cooked beef. Similar results to 

ours were reported by McCarthy et al. [20], where an addition of rosemary extracts (0.2%) to beef patties 

stored in refrigeration had antioxidant activities similar to BHA/BHT (0.01%/0.1%). 

Formanek et al. [21] noted that rosemary extracts worked synergistically with vitamin E to inhibit the 

formation of malondialdehyde (TBARS). Han and Rhee [22] showed that 0.25% (w/w) extracts of rosemary, 

sappanwood, and red or white peony almost completely inhibited lipid oxidation in raw beef patties. 

In general, the effectiveness of these natural antioxidants is proportional to the number of –OH groups 

present on the aromatic rings. If their solubility is compatible with a particular meat system, the fact that 

they are natural and have antioxidant activity that is as good as or better than the synthetics makes them 

particularly attractive for meat products. 

2.4.2. Changes in pH of Raw Beef Patties 

Figure 5 shows the effects of C. decapetala added at two concentrations (0.1% and 0.5%) w/w and 

BHT (0.1%) on the pH values in raw beef patties during cold storage for 11 days. The control sample 

had the highest pH value (5.50), and the pH values of the other treatments decreased with storage time. 

Samples treated with C. decapetala (0.5%) had the lower pH value after storage (5.39). The changes in 

pH value during storage might be due to acidity produced by bacterial action on the muscle glucose and 

accumulation of the microbial metabolites due to bacterial spoilage in pork meat patties [22].

at 0.01% (w/w) on the changes in pH values of raw beef patties. Data is presented as  

mean ± standard deviation. Different letters at the same time (a–d) indicate significant 

differences between samples. 

2.4.3. Color Changes 

The CIE color values in raw ground beef samples with/without spice extracts are shown in Table 2. 

The color of meat and meat products after slaughter and manufacturing is altered by increased metmyoglobin. 

The formation of metmyoglobin is associated with the oxidation of oxymyoglobin (light pink color) 

during storage. L* values showed a small difference for all samples throughout the storage period. Different 

authors refer to these slight changes in the values of L* in meat through the storage time [23,24]. The a* 

value (redness) is the most important color parameter in evaluating meat oxidation, as a decrease in redness 

makes the meat product unacceptable to consumers. In all samples, the redness (a* value) decreased as 

storage time progressed. At the end of the study period (Day 11), the intensity of each color parameter 

was lower than the value measured at Day 0 as a result of the oxidation process, leading in this way to a 

change in color. It is clear that the protective effects of the test extracts against the color loss (a* value 

decrease) in stored beef patties were not as pronounced as their effects against lipid oxidation. At the end 

of storage, the a* values of the CD1 and CD2 samples (−1.02 ± 0.33) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) 

than those of others samples. BHT displayed the highest value of a* at the end of the experiment. 

Therefore, the natural plant extracts affected meat color, specifically redness, and are therefore potentially 

useful in prolonging the shelf life of the meat product. Several authors have reported an a* value decrease 

in different meat and meat products stored under a modified atmosphere [24,25]. The samples had an 

initial yellowness (b*) value of 3.33 ± 0.82. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in b* values 

in all samples throughout storage.

3. Experimental Section 

3.1. Plant Material 

C. decapetala was collected from Perú in the spring of 2012. This was crushed and stored (inside a 

desiccator) in the dark, at room temperature until use. 



Molecules 2015, 20 13922 

 

 

3.2. Chemicals 

Reagents used were: 2-thiobarbituric acid, Trolox, gallic acid, ethanol, phosphate buffered saline 

(PBS), anhydrous sodium carbonate, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Química S.A. (Madrid, Spain) 

and, methanol, hydrogen chloride, ferrous chloride (FeCl2) were acquired from Panreac Química S.L.U. 

(Barcelona, Spain). Distilled water and Milli-Q (Millipore, Barcelona, Spain) water were extracted daily. 

3.3. Sample Extraction 

The powder (1.5 g) of the dried leaves of C. decapetala was stirred using a magnetic stirrer with  

25 mL mixture of ethanol/water (5:5) for 24 h at 4 °C. The extraction was done in triplicate. Then the 

mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm and the separated liquid was collected. A portion of the separated 

liquid was stored at −80 °C until use to determine the antiradical capacity, and the remaining part was 

concentrated in a rotary evaporator and lyophilized. The lyophilized extract was stored in a desiccator 

until use. 

3.4. Preparation of Beef Patties 

Fresh beef samples were purchased from a local fresh food market and minced three times. The meat 

was mixed with salt (1.5%). Four formulations were prepared: negative control (without antioxidant), 

CD1 (C. decapetala 0.1% w/w), CD2 (C. decapetala 0.5%) and BHT (0.01%). The mixing process for 

each formulation was replicated. The ingredients were mixed manually in a steel bowl for about 1 min to 

obtain a homogeneous mixture, and then burgers were formed manually. The beef patties were randomly 

selected and packed in plastic trays which were filled with a gas mixture of 70% O2 + 20% CO2 + 10% N2 

before sealing and they were kept refrigerated at 4 °C for 11 days. 

3.5. Antioxidant Capacity Assay (AOC) 

AOC was determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The sample preparation 

for AOC studies involved extraction of C. decapetala with distilled water or a lipophilic extraction 

solvent system (acetone/ethanol/distilled water; 5:4:1, v/v/v, according to Linden [26].). These solvent 

systems were used to extract the hydrophylic and lipophilic antioxidants. The determination of the 

antioxidant capacity of antioxidants extracted was performed by the FRAP assay (ferric reducing 

antioxidant power). Based on this, the methods are called FRAPwater, or FRAPlipid assays. 

Prior to extraction, deep frozen muscle samples were minced by a disintegrator. Muscle homogenate 

(5 g) was weighed into a glass tube and mixed with 5 mL of extraction solvent for 30 s using an Ultra-Turrax. 

Two different extractions were performed. The first was made with distilled water to dissolve the 

hydrophylic antioxidants and the second was carried with an acetone/ethanol/water mixture (5:4:1, v/v/v) 

to dissolve the lipophilic antioxidants in the muscle. Then the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min. 

Supernatants were filtered using a folded filter and stored in the dark and on ice until immediate analysis. 

Once the supernatant was obtained, the FRAP assay was performed. Measurements were carried out  

in triplicate.

FRAP Assay 

The FRAP assay was carried out according to the procedure described by Benzie and Strain [6] with 

minor modification The determination of reducing capacity was performed with microplates, mixing the 

FRAP reagent incubated at 37 °C with the samples (in an appropriate dilution to cause the absorbance 

to fall in the range 0.1–1.0). The FRAP reagent was prepared from sodium acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), 

10 mM TPTZ solution (40 mM HCl as solvent) and 20 mM iron (III) chloride solution in a volume ratio 

10:1:1, respectively. The samples were measured in triplicate. The absorbance of the reaction mix was 

then detected at 593 nm. The results were expressed as milimoles of Trolox equivalents/g of dry plant. 

3.6. Determination of Metmyoglobin 

Patty samples (5 g) were homogenized together with 25 mL of 0.04 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 

10 s using an Ultra-Turrax mixer. The homogenate was allowed to stand for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged 

at 4500 g for 20 min at 4 °C using a high-speed cooling centrifuge. The absorbance of the filtered 

supernatant was read at 572, 565, 545, and 525 nm. The percentage of metmyoglobin was determined 

using the formula of Krzywicki [27]: 

MetMb (%) = [2.514 (A572/A525) + 0.777 (A565/A525) + 0.8 (A545/A525) + 1.098] × 100 

3.7. Headspace Volatile Analysis 

Hexanal was measured using a TRACE GC gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer 

DSQII (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with automatic injector TRIPLUS with a Head Space module. One gram 

of homogenized patties was placed in a 10 mL glass vial capped with an aluminum cap with PTFE/silicone 

septum. The sample was shaken and heated at 60 °C for 30 min in an autosampler heating block before 

measurement. Vapor phase (1 mL) was injected using a special gas syringe maintained at 65 °C. Hexanal 

concentrations were determined from peak areas using a standard curve prepared from authentic hexanal. 

3.8. Determination of Secondary Oxidation by TBARS 

The TBARS method was used to measure the lipid oxidation over the storage period as described by 

Grau et al. [28].The TBARS reagent was prepared from 15% trichloroacetic acid, 0.375% thiobarbituric 

acid and 2.1% hydrochloric acid. Briefly, 1 g of sample was weighed and protected with 1 mL aqueous 

EDTA, and was mixed with 5 mL of thiobarbituric acid reagent using an Ultra-Turrax (IKA, Staufen, 

Germany) at 32,000 rpm speed for 1 min. It was then filtered with a Whatman filter (0.45 μm) to obtain 

the part soluble in the solvent. All procedures were carried out in the dark and all samples were kept on 

ice. Immediately, the filtered samples were immersed in a water bath preheated to 95 °C ± 1 °C for 10 min. 

Samples were cooled at room temperature for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at λ = 531 nm. 

TBARS value was calculated from the calibration curve of malondialdehyde (MDA). The results are 

expressed as mg malondialdehyde (MDA)/kg of meat.

3.9. pH Measurement 

The pH of 5 g samples was determined with a pH meter (Mettler-Toledo GLP 21,  

Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). 

3.10. Color Measurements 

Color measurements were performed at four points on the surface of the patties using a Minolta 

Chromameter CR-300. Color measurements were observed at 11 days of chilled storage. The L*, a* and 

b* values (CIE L*, a*, b* color system) were assessed as a measure of lightness, redness and yellowness, 

respectively. The instrument was calibrated using a black-and-white glass tile, provided with the 

instrument. The meat samples were kept inside the plastic dishes in triplicate, and then the instrument 

was directly placed on the surface of the meat at three different points for each plastic dish. For every point 

result was a mean of nine measurements. The mean and standard error for each parameter were calculated. 

3.11. Statistical Analysis 

The data were reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were conducted using 

the Minitab software program. The significance of differences was determined by the one-way analysis 

of variance (ANOVA) with Duncan’s pairwise comparison (p < 0.05). 

4. Conclusions 

Our experiments with raw beef patties indicated that the C. decapetala extract may be promising as 

a source of natural antioxidants for meat products. The analysis of TBARS, fatty acid degradation, 

antioxidant activity and concentration of volatile compounds provides a complete assessment of the 

consequences of lipid oxidation in burger patties. The addition of this extract to the beef patties at 0.5% 

was the most effective antioxidant. This concentration inhibited formation of TBARS and volatile 

compounds more effectively than the synthetic antioxidant BHT over the course of 11 days. Using this 

herb extract as an ingredient in burger patties may be an efficient strategy to enhance the nutritional 

value and safety of these meat products.
