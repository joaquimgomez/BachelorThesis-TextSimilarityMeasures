Abstract 7 

Two different spray application methods were compared in three vine varieties at 8 

different crop stages. A conventional spray application with a constant volume rate per 9 

unit ground area (l·ha
-1

) was compared with a variable rate application method designed 10 

to compensate electronically for measured variations in canopy dimensions. An air-blast 11 

sprayer with individual multi-nozzle spouts was fitted with three ultrasonic sensors and 12 

three electro-valves on one side, in order to modify the emitted flow rate of the nozzles 13 

according to the variability of canopy dimensions in real time. The purpose of this 14 

prototype was to precisely apply the required amount of spray liquid and avoid over 15 

dosing. On average, a 58% saving in application volume was achieved with the variable 16 

rate method, obtaining similar or even better leaf deposits.  17

1. Introduction 23 

The efficiency of plant protection products (PPP) depends on many interacting 24 

factors. Crop characteristics (canopy structure, vegetative stage, variety, etc.), 25 

application technique, weather conditions, applied dose rate and others are 26 

interdependent factors that allow, in an adequate combination, to achieve high efficacy 27 

and efficiency values. 28 

Crop-adapted dosing of agrochemicals has been widely discussed in many 29 

publications (Furness, 2003; Walklate et al., 2003; Gil et al., 2005; Godyn et al., 2005; 30 

Viret et al., 2005; Pergher and Petris, 2008). In all cases the main goal has been to adapt 31 

the total amount of PPP to crop characteristics but difficulties were encountered in the 32 

selection of the most suitable crop parameters. The high degree of variability in crop 33 

characteristics has increased the difficulty in obtaining general solutions well adapted to 34 

all crops and situations.  35 

The use of orchard canopy volume as a basis for chemical application rate 36 

calculation and system design was discussed and tested by Sutton and Unrath (1984, 37 

1988). The tree row volume concept maintains that chemical rate recommendation and 38 

application should be based upon crop canopy volume rather than on land area. 39 

Following this methodology other trials have been conducted in order to adapt the spray 40 

volume to crop dimensions in vineyards (Siegfried et al., 2007; Pergher and Petris, 41 

2008). In all cases, accurate measurements of crop dimensions are a key factor for final 42 

success. The use of electronic devices to measure crop dimensions is not a new idea. 43 

McConnell et al. (1983) proposed the use of a system with a vertical mast with range 44 

transducers to measure tree extension, from the trunk outward and towards the row 45 

middle. More recently, Giles et al. (1989), using a modified orchard air-blast sprayer 46 

equipped with three ultrasonic transducers, concluded that savings in pesticide 47 



application when using the electronic control system was strongly related to target crop 48 

architecture. The same authors concluded that sprayer control based upon target 49 

measurement, rather than simple target detection resulted in substantial increases in 50 

savings of applied spray liquid. 51 

To solve the difficulties encountered in crop characterization and to accomplish 52 

the recent EU aim to reduce the total amount of PPP (COM, 2006), environmentally-53 

safe spraying techniques have been developed to spray only when and where needed 54 

with reduced losses to the environment ((Doruchowski and Holownicki, 2000). Recent 55 

advances in computer hardware and software, global navigation satellite systems 56 

(GNSS), canopy sensors and remote sensing offer opportunities for fast and inexpensive 57 

measurements of tree canopy characteristics for variable rate technologies (VRT) 58 

(Zaman and Salyani, 2004). Walklate et al. (2006) using a LIDAR (LIght Detection and 59 

Ranging) concluded that area-density and height adjustments were the best crop 60 

structure parameters on which a simplified scheme for pome fruit spraying could be 61 

based on. Rosell et al. (2009) developed a LIDAR-based measurement system for the 62 

estimation of physical and structural characteristics of plants (plant volume, leaf area 63 

density and leaf area index). The different shapes, sizes and foliar densities found in tree 64 

crops during the same growing season, require a continuous adjustment of the applied 65 

dose rate to optimize the spray application efficiency and to reduce environmental 66 

contamination (Solanelles et al., 2002). Crop characteristics are directly related to the 67 

total amounts of deposit on leaves and values of leaf area and canopy dimensions 68 

(mainly height and width) can widely affect the efficiency values, as a relationship 69 

between the expected deposit and the actual one (Gil et al., 2005). 70 

Target detection has been developed either by using advanced techniques, such 71 

as vision systems and laser scanning, or by ultrasonic and spectral systems. Gil et al. 72 



(2007) obtained a significant reduction in the total amount of applied volume (57%) 73 

using a sprayer prototype with ultrasonic sensors able to measure the crop width 74 

variations and to apply a variable dose rate according to the instantaneous measured 75 

vine row volume (VRV), in comparison with a conventional and constant application 76 

volume rate. However, this reduction did not affect the results in terms of deposit, leaf 77 

coverage and penetration where similar normalized values were achieved. 78 

Whitney et al. (2002) investigated the ultrasonic transducer’s response to 79 

different parts of a citrus canopy and also examined the effect of the sampling frequency 80 

and the transducer spacing on canopy volume determination. More recently Balsari et 81 

al. (2008) using a crop identification system based on ultrasonic sensors, confirmed its 82 

suitability for detecting canopy characteristics in real time, independently of the forward 83 

speed, as previous studies already indicated (Zaman and Salyani, 2004). 84 

It seems that any approach to adapt the spraying volume rate to crop 85 

characteristics will lead with a general principle that foliar application must results in 86 

similar deposits (mg·cm
-2

), independently of crop size or canopy density. That system 87 

would avoid the problem of over dosage of PPP detected as a frequent problem in the 88 

early crop growth stages, especially in orchards and vineyards where in most cases 89 

pesticide dose rate is expressed in many different ways (Koch, 2007). 90 

But in any case selective application with a precise target detection system must 91 

assure uniform deposits and must guarantee that large savings in sprayed application 92 

volume rates will not affect biological efficacy. This assumption has been confirmed in 93 

trials using different electronic control strategies (Koch and Weisser, 2000) who 94 

obtained no significant differences between a sensor based and a conventional 95 

application technique for apple scab (Ventura inequalis), pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyri 96 

xx) and leaf and bud mite (Aculus schechtendali xx) control. 97 



This paper describes the characteristics of a sprayer prototype able to 98 

automatically adapt the spray application rate according to the target geometry, using an 99 

adapted tree-row-volume (TRV) estimation method (Pergher and Petris, 2008; Rüegg et 100 

al., 1999). Results in terms of deposit of tracer (mg·cm
-2

) and leaf recovery (actual 101 

recovered tracer compared with the expected according leaf area) have been calculated 102 

and compared with those obtained with a conventional method based on a per land 103 

surface dosage system (l·ha
-1

). In order to evaluate the influence of the leaf morphology, 104 

research trials have been conducted in three representative vineyards (cv. Merlot, cv. 105 

Cabernet Sauvignon and cv. Tempranillo) at two growth stages. 106 

The objectives of this research were: a) to analyze the ability of ultrasonic 107 

sensors in determining vineyard structure; b) to investigate the spray volume savings 108 

achieved through the use of a target measurement sprayer control system based on the 109 

instantaneous vine volume, iVV (an adapted VRV principle); to evaluate the efficiency 110 

of the proposed spraying system, in comparison with the conventional application based 111 

on land surface; and d) to determine the relationship between spray volume savings and 112 

canopy structure. 113

2. Material and methods 115 

2.1. Sprayer design 116 

The development and testing of the target measurement and sprayer control 117 

system used in this research have been previously described and discussed (Gil et al., 118 

2007) and will only be briefly outlined in this article. The measurement system and the 119 

electronic process unit were mounted on an air-blast orchard sprayer (Hardi LE-600 120 

BK/2 with a centrifugal fan of 400 mm diameter). The sprayer was equipped with six 121 

individual and adjustable spouts (three on each side of the machine) in which up to five 122 



nozzles could be arranged on each one.  A mast was fitted on its left side to hold three 123 

ultrasonic sensors and a solenoid high frequency electro valve was in front of each of 124 

the three spouts linked to each ultrasonic sensor. The three sensors and electro valves 125 

were connected to the central control unit placed on the rear top of the sprayer on which 126 

a purpose developed software based on LabVIEW (National Instruments Corporation, 127 

Austin, USA) was used to transform the crop width measured by each sensor into flow 128 

rate at every nozzle set (Figure 1) according equation [1]: 129

) and n the number of 133 

nozzles per manifold (equal to 2). 134 

 135 

2.2. Experimental plots 136 

Trials were conducted in three different grape varieties (Merlot, Cabernet 137 

Sauvignon and Tempranillo) and at two different growth stages (75 and 85 according to 138 

the BBCH-scale (Meier, 2001). In all cases a total length of at least 100 m of five rows 139 

were sprayed (1,500 m
2
 of experimental plot), and sample leaves for deposit 140 

measurements were only taken from the three different blocks randomly established in 141 

the center row. In every block, a sample of 1 m length of row was established, on which 142 

plants were divided into four different zones according to height (every 0.40 m, ranging 143 

from 0.40 m to 1.60 m), and three zones according to depth within the crop (I: external 144 

left, II: centre; and III: external right). From each of the twelve sampling positions 145 

(Figure 2), three replicates of samples were collected after spraying and stored in plastic 146 

bags. 147 



 148 

2.3. Treatments 149 

A set of tests was arranged on each variety and growth stage in order to compare 150 

the efficiency of application of the variable rate system with a conventional spraying 151 

procedure based on a constant application volume rate (l·ha
-1

) selected for each situation 152 

according to the usual rates in the area and growth stage. For the variable rate system, 153 

the application coefficient of m = 0.095 l·m
-3

vegetation was maintained in all cases. This 154 

application rate was selected according to previous research (Gil, 2001) where interest 155 

and benefits of this value in terms of efficacy and efficiency of applications were 156 

demonstrated. The sprayer settings (Table 1) were maintained as close as possible 157 

between treatments in order to avoid external sources of variability. 158 

 159 

2.4. Leaf area measurements 160 

The leaf area index (LAI) was measured for each variety after the trials. For this 161 

purpose, two replicates of 1.0 m length were randomly selected among the five treated 162 

rows and leaves were picked independently into four plastic bags, corresponding to the 163 

four crop sample zones from 0.4 m to 1.6 m height (Figure 2). The total weight of each 164 

individual leaf sample was determined in the laboratory. The leaf area index was 165 

determined by area: weight ratio estimation for each variety and crop stage (Gil et al., 166 

2007; Cross et al., 2001). All the obtained relationships were determined by measuring 167 

the weight and surface area of 50 samples collected from the bottom, middle and top 168 

parts of the vine. Surface area (one side only) was measured with a LI-COR LI 3100C 169 

electronic planimeter. 170 

 171 

2.5. Measurement of deposits 172 



Deposit and spatial distribution of spray liquid was measured using EDTA 173 

metallic chelates (Mn for conventional application and Zn for the variable rate system) 174 

as spray tracers (Gil et al., 2005; Gil et al., 2007; Cross et al., 2001; Murray et al., 2000) 175 

at a rate ranging from 0.68 to 1.80 g·l
-1

 depending on treatment (Table 1) following the 176 

same protocol established by Gil et al. (2007). Spraying different tracers for each 177 

treatment allowed the same leaf samples to be used and reduces the effect of canopy 178 

variability (Murray et al., 2000; Solanelles et al., 2005). Prior to the application, 25 179 

leaves were picked from every individual block as blank samples, in order to determine 180 

the possible presence of metals. In all cases values of tracer concentration in the blank 181 

samples were less than the detection limit of the spectrophotometer (< 0.01 ppm). Once 182 

collected, all plastic bags containing leaf samples were placed in a dark container and 183 

stored in a refrigerator until the extraction process. Collection of samples was 184 

completed within 2 hours after the last application. Tracer deposit d in mg·cm
-2

 was 185 

determined by adding an exact quantity of deionized water as extractant (100 ml) and 186 

the subsequent measurement of tracer concentration using an atomic absorption 187 

spectrometer (Variant Spectra 1100). Three samples of roughly 100 ml of the spray 188 

solution for each treatment were taken from the tank of the sprayer immediately before 189 

and after application in order to determine the real tank concentration for each metal. 190 

 191 

2.6. Analysis and expression of results 192 

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS system v.8 (SAS Institute Inc., 193 

Cary, NC, USA).The symbols used are reported in the notation table using a previously 194 

defined nomenclature (Pergher and Gubiani, 1995). 195 



The amount of spray deposited per unit leaf area by a particular treatment (d,) 196 

was calculated by dividing the tracer concentration in the washing solution of sample 197 

(Tcl) by the total leaf area of the sample La , according equation [2] 198 

a

where d is the tracer deposit per unit leaf area (mg·cm

washing solution of sample leaf (mg·l
-1

), w the amount of deionized water (ml) and La 202 

area of sample leaf (cm
2
)  203 

 Since the tracer application rates (Tcs) were not the same for all treatments, a 204 

normalized deposit, dn (mg·cm
-2

leaf /mg·cm
-2

ground) was then calculated according to 205 

equation [3], by dividing the actual deposit d by the amount of metal tracer applied per 206 

unit ground area: 207

where dn is the normalized tracer deposit rate per unit leaf surface (mg·cm

deposit per unit area of leaf surface (mg·cm
-2

), V the spray volume rate (l·ha
-1

) and Tcs 211 

the tracer concentration of spray mixture in the tank (mg·l
-1

) 212 

The normalized deposit procedure enables comparisons between the different 213 

sprayers and/or the different technologies, and has been based on the total amount of 214 

tracer applied per ground area. This procedure has been previously applied (Cross et al., 215 

2001; Viret el al., 2003; Siegfried et al., 2007) where comparisons between sprayers 216 

and/or field conditions were arranged.  217 



At the same the proportion of spray retained on the leaves (Dl) was also 218 

calculated (equation [4]) according the equation used by Pergher and Gubiani (1995), 219 

Cross et al. (2001) and Gil et al. (2007): 220

In all cases, values of tracer concentration measured on blank samples were included in 223 

the calculation and normalization procedure. Prior to statistical analyses, a normal 224 

adjustment of the obtained data using a logarithmic transformation was applied in order 225 

to stabilize variances (Doruchowski et al., 1996; Gil et al., 2007). 226 

 227 

3. Results 228 

3.1. Quantification of savings 229 

One of the objectives of this research was to calculate the total savings in the 230 

applied liquid. According to the application rate adjusted for every individual test, Table 231 

2 shows the individual and average saving of liquid for all varieties and crop stages. In 232 

all cases saving values are greater than 40%, with the highest value for cv. Tempranillo 233 

(77%) in the last growth stage (BBCH-scale 85). In this particular situation some 234 

pruning before the test probably affected the measurements obtained by the sensors, 235 

increasing the distance to the crop and reducing substantially the applied volume (86 236 

l·ha
-1

) compared to previous applications, whereas the conventional application volume 237 

rate was increased according to the normal procedure in the area. In general, the average 238 

savings obtained were approximately 58%, being in accordance with previous research 239 

(Koch and Weisser, 2000; Gil et al., 2007; Moltó et al., 2000; Balsari and Tamagnone, 240 

1998; Solanelles et al., 2005). A detailed reading of results shown in Table 3 indicates a 241 

good correlation between canopy volume and leaf recovery in variable rate application, 242 



giving better results for highest values of TRV (Figure 3) measured according the 243 

methodology proposed by Siegfried et al. (2007). 244 

The spatial distribution of savings can be observed in Figure 4. As an example, 245 

this figure shows a sample of 20 meters of crop line (cv. Merlot) where all the measured 246 

points with ultrasonic sensors have been represented (every 80 ms corresponding to 10 247 

cm along the crop line). For every measured point the applied volume in variable rate 248 

application mode, calculated according to the measured distance with sensors, can be 249 

compared with that applied with the conventional spraying mode. Differences between 250 

those two lines represent the savings of liquid. It is important to highlight the perfect 251 

similitude of liquid amount delivered by the variable application method with the crop 252 

profile line. In figure great differences can be observed between the two applied volume 253 

rates. However, in any case those savings must be analyzed and evaluated together with 254 

averaged deposit values obtained for the two tested methodologies. 255 

 256 

3.2. Deposit on leaves 257 

According to the obtained values of normalized deposit on leaves dn, 258 

proportional leaf recovery Dl and spatial uniformity of deposit on the whole canopy 259 

measured by the coefficient of variation of total deposit samples (Table 3), the variable 260 

rate application method showed higher leaf deposits in all cases except for those 261 

obtained for cv. Merlot. For the remaining cases, differences in dn between the two 262 

tested methods differ significantly in favor of the variable rate method. In terms of 263 

proportion of spray retained (Dl), the same tendency has been observed. In all cases, 264 

variable application method gave the highest values of retention, always greater than 265 

40%. It is interesting to remark the highest value of proportional leaf recovery (86.85%) 266 



obtained in cv. Tempranillo at 75 of BBCH-scale. On the contrary, retention values 267 

obtained with conventional applications were below 40%, except for cv. Merlot. 268 

The spatial uniformity of leaf deposit in the whole canopy, measured by means 269 

of the coefficient of variation (CV %) of the total deposit samples on the crop (Table 3) 270 

indicates that in cv. Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, variable rate applications 271 

gave CV values under 50%, with a more uniform deposit than obtained for conventional 272 

applications. For cv. Merlot, the tendency was the opposite: conventional applications 273 

gave the most uniform results. 274 

Graphics of the spatial distribution of leaf deposit within the canopy are shown 275 

in Figure 5. In general, high uniformity can be observed in all cases, independently of 276 

the spray method (conventional or variable), crop stage or crop variety. A deeper 277 

analysis of figure 5 indicates higher values of normalized leaf deposits for the variable 278 

rate application method than those obtained with the conventional method. 279 

The effect of variable rate applications on the quality of leaf deposits measured 280 

by the coefficient of variation of the total sample zones on the vine (dn) and the 281 

normalized leaf recovery expressed as a percentage of the total emitted output (Dl), are 282 

shown in Figure 6. The general tendency indicates a slow but homogeneous movement 283 

to the right of the graph, which means an increase in normalized leaf recovery, obtained 284 

in all cases with the lower volume rates. The diameter of each individual circle 285 

represents the average normalized deposit (dn) on each treatment. Following the same 286 

trend as observed for leaf recovery, the variable rate technology gives the highest values 287 

of normalized deposit. And in terms of uniformity of deposits, in general all the circles 288 

are located close to the center line (horizontal), meaning similar values of uniformity 289 

(coefficient of variation). 290 



A detailed analysis of the distribution of sample frequencies was conducted in 291 

order to compare the normalized deposit in both methods. It is interesting to notice that 292 

in all cases variable rate applications gave higher cumulative frequencies of leaf 293 

samples with higher deposits. Remarkable results have been obtained at the earlier crop 294 

stage (BBCH-75) in cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and cv. Tempranillo. 295 

 296 

3.3. Crop profile and liquid distribution 297 

Figure 7 shows the relation between crop profile (leaf surface distribution with 298 

height) and total deposits measured at each crop level. In general in all cases it can be 299 

observed how deposits for conventional application follow a vertical line, independently 300 

of leaf distribution on each level. Those lines must be compared with those related to 301 

variable rate application, which present in general better adaptation to leaf distribution. 302 

Quantification of this adaptation can be done by means of the coefficient of correlation 303 

(r) between profiles (Figure 7). In all cases, except in the latest crop stage in cv. 304 

Tempranillo, variable rate spraying offered better adaptation to crop profile or at least 305 

the same values as conventional spraying (i.e. var. Merlot). 306 

Another important aspect regarding the relationship between crop structure and 307 

applied volume can be observed in Figure 8, representing values obtained in cv. Merlot. 308 

In that figure, variation of the real application coefficient m (l·m
-3

) has been plotted 309 

together with the obtained measures of canopy volume (m
3
) with the ultra sonic sensors. 310 

Solid line on the graphic indicates the theoretical m value for which the variable rate 311 

sprayer was adjusted. Values of real m (l·m
-3

) rate delivered with the variable rate 312 

system have been represented with triangles on the same graphic. Results show a great 313 

coincidence with the objective, mainly in situations with a high canopy volume (right 314 

part of the figure). The most important deviations from the intended objective can be 315 



observed for situations with low or very low crop canopy (left part of the figure). This 316 

behavior is due to spraying those areas with the minimum established pressure 317 

(sometimes overdosing) to ensure the quality of the droplets. Obtained results in 318 

conventional application (represented by square points on the graph) indicates that the 319 

objective is only achieved for canopy values over 0.04 m
3
 with high overdose generated 320 

in case of lower canopy volumes. In fact, this behavior is the expected in a constant 321 

flow rate application. The selected flow rate is the one that best fits worst cases (highest 322 

canopy volumes) found in the vineyard. As the sprayed flow rate does not vary with 323 

canopy volume decrease, the result is an over sprayed canopy in situations different than 324 

the worst case. The application coefficient increases as the canopy decreases. 325 

 326 

4. Discussion 327 

Even in uniform vineyards, important differences can be observed in crop width 328 

and thus in canopy volume along the line. The use of electronic systems capable to 329 

determine these differences in real time and the ability to adjust the working parameters 330 

according to these variations is an interesting way to achieve savings in the total amount 331 

of sprayed pesticides. 332 

The use of ultrasonic sensors together with variable rate electro-valves and the 333 

corresponding software for automation, made possible a real time modification of the 334 

spray flow rate according to the canopy volume. This allowed a significant reduction in 335 

spray volume while maintaining coverage and penetration rates similar or even better to 336 

conventional methods. 337 

Ultrasonic sensors and their measurements of crop canopy allow tracer deposits 338 

to be varied according to leaf distribution in the crop profile. This fact is extremely 339 

important in order to obtain leaf deposits close to the intended threshold. 340 



Results obtained in all crop conditions and varieties encourage the continuation 341 

of this research, maintaining as the main goal of increasing pesticide savings and 342 

improved liquid distribution according to the crop characteristics.  343
