Abstract: The use of a scanning Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to 

characterize drift during pesticide application is described. The LIDAR system is compared 

with an ad hoc test bench used to quantify the amount of spray liquid moving beyond the 

canopy. Two sprayers were used during the field test; a conventional mist blower at two air 

flow rates (27,507 and 34,959 m3·h−1) equipped with two different nozzle types 

(conventional and air injection) and a multi row sprayer with individually oriented air 

outlets. A simple model based on a linear function was used to predict spray deposit using 

LIDAR measurements and to compare with the deposits measured over the test bench. 

Results showed differences in the effectiveness of the LIDAR sensor depending on the 

sprayed droplet size (nozzle type) and air intensity. For conventional mist blower and low 

air flow rate; the sensor detects a greater number of drift drops obtaining a better 

correlation (r = 0.91; p < 0.01) than for the case of coarse droplets or high air flow rate. In 

the case of the multi row sprayer; drift deposition in the test bench was very poor. In 

general; the use of the LIDAR sensor presents an interesting and easy technique to 

establish the potential drift of a specific spray situation as an adequate alternative for the 

evaluation of drift potential.

1. Introduction 

Adequate deposition in the whole canopy according to the specifications of the treatment is one of 

the objectives of a pesticide application. Meanwhile spray drift continues to be a major problem in 

applying agricultural pesticides. Drift can cause crop protection chemicals to be deposited in 

undesirable areas with serious consequences [1]. Drift reduction and improvement of efficiency of 

pesticide application process is one of the goals of the 128/2009/CE European Directive for a 

Sustainable Use of Pesticides [2]. The imminent and mandatory establishment of National Action 

Plans by every European Union (EU) member will include the definition, establishment and 

quantification of buffer zones with quantitative information about drift potential of every sprayer and 

configuration. According to ISO 22866:2005 [3] drift is defined as “the quantity of plant protection 

product that is carried out of the sprayed (treated) area by the action of air currents during the 

application process”. In an orchard setting, this includes droplets which move horizontally through the 

orchard canopy and out the sides of the orchard, and droplets which are above the canopy (due to 

direct spraying into the air or diffusion up from the sprayed canopy) and move vertically into the 

atmosphere. Most drift involves droplets which move above the canopy for some or all of their 

pathways [4]. 

A realistic representation of spray drift could, for example, not only reveals a given percentile of the 

spray drift expected at a given distance from a field, but it could show the entire range of spray drift 

that might be observed, caused by different weather conditions or the equipment (nozzle type) [5]. 

Spray drift has been studied extensively [6,7], in a series of field trials and for many crops. The results 

from these studies are currently used in pesticide registration in the EU. Specifically, the 90th 

percentile of all measured ‘‘drift values’’ (the amount of drifted residues) is commonly applied in 

ecotoxicological risk assessments. The data include the variability of spray drift between different 

fields (field trials) and the variability within fields (different Petri dishes placed at the same distance 

from the field border). But, despite the wide variety of collected data, not all the scenarios can be 

identified. Spray drift is highly influenced by many factors that may be grouped [8] into one of the 

following categories: equipment and application techniques; spray characteristics; operator care and 

skill. Diverse methodologies [9–12] developed in the last years to evaluate and quantify the effect of 

different parameters involved in the process, in a big effort to define a spray classification, have 

always resulted in great variability due to the influence of environmental conditions. 

In general, arrangement of field tests for drift measurement is very difficult and expensive. The ISO 

22866:2005 norm defines the procedure to quantify drift during field tests, but this method is complex, 

time consuming and depends heavily on external conditions such as wind, being difficult to adopt and 

may have poor result repeatability. These facts, together with the need to maintain the spray track 

perpendicular to the wind direction make the arrangement of field tests a cumbersome and difficult 

process. Other researchers [13] have concluded that a sequence of experiments could last for several 

hours avoiding changing the line of measurements as long as the average wind deviation was in the 

range of ±30° from the original line. 

But independent of the difficulties of field trial arrangements, the key problem in spray drift and 

dispersion assessment studies [14] has been the quantification of spray droplet concentration as it 

cannot be accurately extrapolated from point measurements to determine spatial dispersion [4]. It helps

conclude that presently available direct and indirect methods of spray drift measurements were 

inadequate for measuring plumes of drifting aerosols. For these reasons, different authors have proposed 

different drift measurements, in an attempt to develop easy, repeatable and precise methods as an 

alternative to current standards. There are many methods available for sampling spray drift, and a great 

variety of estimates of spray drift have been published based on mathematical analysis [15],  

probabilistic estimations [5] or through the development of computational models based on indirect 

drift measurements [16–18]. In [19] the authors developed a drift prediction equation for reference 

spraying to predict the expected magnitude of sedimenting drift for various drift distances and 

atmospheric conditions. In [20] a new drift test bench for measurement of drift generated by a boom 

sprayer in a simpler and quicker way than the ISO 22866:2005 methodology was developed. The same 

device was successfully used by [21] to assess drift potential of a citrus herbicide applicator. 

Sensor technology is an interesting alternative for drift evaluation purposes. Several studies [4,14,22] 

were carried out using Light and Detection Ranging (LIDAR) technology to measure drift. The authors 

of [23] used LIDAR to measure near-field pesticide spray movements in wing-tip vortices of a spray 

aircraft but not downwind drift. Stoughton et al. [24] adapted LIDAR technology to measure pesticide 

movement above an oak forest. The LIDAR system was found to be a highly useful spray plume 

movement measuring tool, as evidenced by the return images of spray material aloft for up to 2000 m 

downwind and well up into the mixing layer. 

The specific scenario of spray processes in orchards is one of the most risky activities from the 

environmental point of view. In these cases, several researchers have selected LIDAR as an alternative 

device for drift measurement. In [4] a LIDAR system developed at the University of Connecticut was 

used to measure the concentration of small droplets in the air above an orange orchard canopy during 

and after the sprayer operation. The LIDAR sensor was able to measure and evaluate airborne drift 

differences between stable and unstable conditions. The authors of [25] developed a model to predict 

airborne drift according the target structure. The model utilizes LIDAR measurements of optical 

transmission to predict the characteristics of airborne drift of plant protection product’s (PPP) leaving 

the target orchard at different growth stages and modified drift characteristic for different methods of 

dose adjustment. Good agreement was demonstrated between the measurements and predictions of 

drift from a semi-dwarf apple orchard at full-dose application rates. LIDAR systems have been used 

successfully to observe spray dispersion in stable [22] and unstable atmospheric conditions [26]. The 

technique has also been used for monitoring dispersion of smoke from forest fires [27]. In [28] a 

methodology to calibrate a scanning elastic backscatter LIDAR and extrapolate droplet point 

measurements in both space and time was developed. 

The objectives of this research were to verify the use of a LIDAR sensor to measure the drift cloud 

during pesticide application in a vineyard and to study the effect of different working parameters (nozzle 

type, sprayer characteristics and air settings) on the total amount of liquid exceeding the target canopy. 

2. Material and Methods  

An experimental study was designed to characterize the amount of spray liquid that traversed the 

canopy during the spray application process over a vertical vine crop by using a Light Detection and 

Ranging (LIDAR) sensor system. Field trials were carried out in Castell del Remei, Lleida (N.E. Spain)

in August 2011. The vine was a common Spanish trellis system (Royat) of var. Merlot vineyard with a 

3 m distance between rows and 1.5 m between plants in the row (2,222 plants·ha−1). All field trials 

were carried out during the last week of July, coinciding with the BBCH 83 crop stage [29].  

2.1. Sprayers Adjustment 

The tractor (Fendt Farmer 207 DT) and the sprayer were driven parallel to the row at a constant 

forward speed of 4.4 km·h−1, in a straight line between the last two rows of vines. Two different 

sprayers, a conventional mist blower (Master 2000, Talleres Corbins, Lleida, Spain) equipped with a 

940 mm diameter axial fan without deflectors and a multi row sprayer (Hardi Iris-2, Ilemo-Hardi, 

S.A.U., Lleida, Spain) with tangential turbine and individual oriented air outlets were tested (Figure 1). 

The conventional mistblower was adjusted using the two fan gear box (H and L), corresponding to 

31.1 and 24.4 m·s−1 air speed, respectively. These two air speeds generated two different air flow rates 

of 34,959 m3·h−1 and 27,507 m3·h−1. These two air adjustments were combined with two different 

nozzle types: a conventional hollow cone ATR yellow, and air injection hollow cone, TVI-80015, both 

from Albuz (Saint-Gobain Ceramiques Advancees Desmarquest, Evreux, France). The droplet 

spectrum generated by these two nozzles has been classified as Very Fine (VF) and Coarse (C), 

respectively, according to [30,31]. The multi row unit was adjusted for an air flow rate of 6,423 m3·h−1 

and was equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles (Albuz ATR orange). Table 1 shows the 

details of the sprayer adjustments.

(1) According to BCPC classification [30] (VF: Very Fine; C: Coarse); (2) Flow rate per single nozzle. 

Air flow rate characteristics of the two sprayers were measured using a digital anemometer  

(Meteo Digit I, Lambrecht Klimatologische Messtechnik, Göttingen, Germany). Three replicates of the 

measurements were carried out at different points of the air outlets of the two sprayers (five points of 

measurement on each side of the air outlet of the conventional sprayer and 14 on each one of the four 

single drop legs for the multi-row sprayer) in order to obtain the average air speed (m·s−1) and its 

spatial distribution. 

2.2. Spray Liquid and Tracer Concentration 

Spray tanks were filled up to its half capacity with pure water and a certain quantity of a 

commercial tracer (Tartrazine, E-102, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added in order to obtain a 

constant concentration of 8,000 mg·L−1. Each spray run consisted of a single pass of the tractor and 

sprayer between the last two rows of the parcel, simulating the generally established normal spray 

procedure. A total of three replicates were conducted for each test. Weather conditions during every 

test were recorded (Table 2) using an automatic weather station (WatchDog weather station Model 

2550, Spectrum Technologies, Inc, Plainfield, IL, USA) placed 5 m away from the spray track.

2.3. Drift Detection Measurements 

During the trials two different methods (LIDAR sensor and a test bench) were used to quantify the 

amount of spray liquid escaping the canopy and also its distribution over a perpendicular line away 

from the canopy. The two methods were used at a time during the tractor movement along the crop row.  

In the first method, drift measurements were made using a LIDAR sensor located at 4 m from the 

last sprayed canopy row, oriented to be able to measure the cloud drift on a perpendicular plane

relative to the canopy row as shown in Figure 2. The LIDAR scanner used in this work was a low cost 

general-purpose (model LMS-200, Sick, Dusseldorf, Germany), with accuracy of ±15 mm and  

5.2 mrad of divergence in a range up to 8 m, a selectable angular resolution of 1°, 0.5° or 0.25° and a 

scanning angle of 180°. This sensor has been previously used as electronic system for canopy 

characterization [32,33]. In this research, an angular resolution of 1° and a scanning angle of 180° 

were used. This setting allows obtaining a scan process of the whole area with gaps in between. 

Settings to get a full scan implicates to select 180° scanning angle with angular resolution of 0.5°, or 

100° with 0.25 angular resolutions. In these cases, the LIDAR’s manufacturer guarantee a complete 

scan but precision on time of measurements decreased considerably due to the limitations of the RS232 

serial port. For that reason, those alternatives were rejected. The LMS-200 has a standard RS232 serial 

port for data transfer with a selectable rate of 9.6, 19.2 or 38.4 Kbit·s−1. For these assays the sensor 

was configured to record a scan cloud every 0.1 second. 

Figure 2. Scheme of placement of drift measurement devices (LIDAR sensor and test 

bench) related to last crop row and track followed by the tractor during field tests.  

 

Spray drift cloud exceeding the canopy was scanned for an average of 40 seconds (total time of 

LIDAR scanning on a single test) during the spray track along the row, 20 s before the sprayer pass in 

front of the LIDAR and 20 s after, representing a total measurement distance of 50 m (Figure 2). When 

the drift cloud is intercepted by the laser beam, the sensor determines, from the reflected signal, the 

angular position θi and the radial distance ri of every single impact (Figure 3), following the described 

process in [32]. The obtained data represents a vertical outline (or slice) of the drift for the current 

position of the LIDAR. When drift is produced, the LIDAR scanner supplied a cluster of impact points 

in 3D coordinates. Data acquisition process was arranged using the specific LIDARSCAN v.1® 

software (Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Span), able to convert LIDAR impacts into data pairs

according to θi and ri parameters. MATLAB 7.11 software (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) 

was used for process support. This program allowed viewing a cloud of points in a plot of all the scans 

done during each trial and this program was used for all numerical analysis of data (Figures 3 and 4).

three-dimensional view of the drift cloud escaping the canopy. Right part of the figure 

indicates the measurement process determining the values of angular position (θi) and 

radial distance (ri) of e very single LIDAR impact.

Drift was measured as the amount of liquid escaping the canopy. For this purpose, a kind of test 

bench was built. It consists of a 20 m long stain steel structure, placed perpendicularly to the canopy

row, where artificial collectors (15 cm diameter Petri dishes) were placed at intervals of 0.5 m starting 

at 2.5 m away from the last canopy row and placed at 0.5 m over the ground (Figure 2). Petri dishes 

were picked up after the sprayer passes allowing collecting the spray liquid exceeding the canopy. 

Deposition on each sample was measured using a fluorimeter (Thermo Scientific Genesys 20, 

Waltham, MA, USA) after a dilution using a known amount of deionized water, following the 

methodology reported by [20,21]. Deposit on each artificial collector (Di), expressed in μL·cm−2, was 

calculated according to Equation (1):

where: ρsmpl is the absorbance value (adim); ρblk the absorbance value of the blanks (adim.); Vdil the 

volume of diluent (deionized water) used to dissolve tracer deposit from collector in μl; ρspray the 

absorbance value of the spray mix concentration applied during the tests and sampled at the nozzle 

(adim.); and Acol is the projected area of the collector for catching the spray drift in cm
2. 

2.4. Relationship between LIDAR Data and Deposition on Test Bench  

This section describes the methodology developed for a comparative assessment of drift measures 

obtained with the two methods. A simple model based on a linear function was developed to estimate 

the droplet’s trajectory measured with LIDAR sensor and its consequent deposit on a particular 

position over the test bench. Previous works have already modeled the droplets’ trajectory using 

complex equations including a large number of parameters [16–19]. This aspect represented one of the 

most critical aspects of the whole process due to the difficulty in describing a drift model of droplet 

trajectory considering the great number of parameters involved [17]. However, for the purpose of this 

research, the most important parameter was the final position of the droplet in relation with the canopy 

position, independently of the trajectory (Figure 5). 

Figure 5. Representation of different droplet’s trajectory applied to predict final deposit 

over the test bench. In this case the linear trajectory with slope value=1 was chosen to 

model the droplet’s deposition.  

 



Sensors 2013, 13 524 

 

 

The sedimentation model starts with the definition of a linear function. This function is then applied 

to the origin point (X0, Y0, Figure 5) in order to determine the final point (deposition point—X1, Y1). As 

the X1 coordinate is a known value (the horizontal plane where collectors were placed, approx.:  

350 mm), Y1 can be calculated. After that procedure (X1, Y1) can be plotted on a graph, being necessary 

to repeat the whole process for all the points cloud detected on the cloud. 

Figure 6. Relationship between average coefficient of determination (R2) from the 

regression analysis of all comparison among LIDAR drift data and test bench data, and the 

assumed negative slope of the hypothetical droplet’s trajectory.  

 

For that reason, a linear model was evaluated varying the slope value from −0.3 to −1.4 at  

0.1 intervals and assessing in all cases the relationship with the distribution of deposits obtained with 

the test bench (Figure 6). Obtained results suggested good correlation without differences for slopes 

ranging from −0.9 to −1.4. According to that, the selected line slope value was −1.0, giving a 

compromise between the particular situations with high air flow velocity (higher adjustment with low 

line slope) and low air flow velocity (higher adjustment with high line slope). 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Air Velocity and Air Profile of the Two Tested Sprayers 

Averaged values of air velocity generated by the two sprayers were 31.1 m·s−1 and 24.4 m·s−1 for 

the two settings of the mistblower, and 14.6 m·s−1 for the multi-row sprayer. It is important to remark 

not only the great differences in terms of air velocity between the two tested sprayers, but also the 

uniformity of air distribution in all the air outlets. Figure 7 shows the air velocity distribution generated 

by the conventional sprayer at the two different tested conditions (high and low air flow rate) and the 

multi-row sprayer (low air flow rate). This figure indicates good uniformity of air distribution for 

multi-row sprayer, in comparison with the heterogeneity observed in the case of the mistblower, with 

great differences on air speed values depending on the measurement point of the air outlet, and also 

remarkable differences between left and right side, as a consequence of the fan rotation. Considerable 

improvements of air distribution were observed in the case of multi-row sprayer, where greater 

uniformity among the air velocity of the single air outlets was detected (Figure 7).

3.2. Determination of Drift Potential through LIDAR Impacts Evaluation 

The placement of the LIDAR sensor in reference to the target area and the measurement procedure 

allows obtaining two different spatial estimations of drift escaping the canopy. Figures 8 and 9 show 

the spatial distribution of LIDAR impacts (potential drift) arranged according to the evaluated variable 

(type of sprayer, air flow rate and nozzle type). Figure 8 represents the comparison between drift cloud 

generated with the two tested air flow rates (red and green points respectively) and the effect of nozzle 

type (conventional or air injection nozzles), both represented in part (a) and (b) of the figure 

respectively. In all cases, left graphic plots the total LIDAR impacts from a zenithal view, during the 

whole spray time of 40 s (Y-axis) and covering the total sprayed row length (≈50 m). The right graphic 

in the figure represent the LIDAR impacts measured on a vertical plane from the point of sensor 

placement. This figure represents a cumulative measurement point of all single slices measured during 

the spray pass. In this case Y-axis indicates the drift cloud width measured from the sensor’s 

placement during the total spray time (40 s). 

Figure 8 also shows some indexes in order to assess the spray cloud generated by the LIDAR. 

Specifically it was calculate the maximum length, maximum height and gravitational center of the 

obtained LIDAR points. It is observed that total length of the drift cloud for the conventional 

mistblower when it was settled with high air flow rate and conventional nozzles was 2 m wider than that 

determined for low air flow rate with the same type of nozzles. No relevant differences (less than 0.3 m) 

were observed for the average drift cloud height and gravitational center placement. The effect of air 

injection nozzles can be observed in the lower part of Figure 8. In this case the air assistance generates 

a drift cloud twice as wide than the one detected with low air flow rate. In the case of high air flow rate 

LIDAR impacts were detected 8.0 m away from the canopy. Also in this case it is interesting to remark 

the differences in the gravitational center placement. High air assistance displaces the gravitational 

point far away from canopy.

Figure 8. Example of zenithal (left) and elevation view (right) of drift cloud measured 

with LIDAR in different field tests: (a) drift cloud for conventional mist blower with 

conventional nozzles and using high (red) and low (green) air flow rate; (b) drift cloud for 

conventional mist blower with air injection nozzles and using high (red) and low (green) 

air flow rate. Maximum height, maximum length and gravitational center point are also 

represented for the LIDAR impacts’ cloud. Note that 0 mm in X-axis represents the 

LIDAR placement. 

 

Great differences on drift cloud depending on nozzle type can be observed. High impact density on 

the upper graphics on Figure 8 (conventional nozzles) could be assumed as an important portion of the 

spray exceeding the canopy, in comparison with the very low impact density obtained with air 

injection nozzles (lower part of the figure). But these differences can also be linked to the difficulty of 

the laser beam to impact on a less dense cloud, even if these droplets have bigger size (air injection 

nozzles) and, as a consequence, high amount of sprayed liquid close to the canopy. Figure 8 (part a) 

compares the drift clouds detected with LIDAR at different air flow rates. In this case the effect of high 

air assistance is clearly detected with LIDAR. Red points (corresponding to highest air flow rate) in 

both cases (horizontal and vertical plane plots) were detected far away from the canopy and in a most 

perpendicular position according to the target placement. This fact is related with the probability of 

finding spray deposit on soil at large distances from the canopy. The elevation view of the drift cloud 

(right part of the figure) shows the impact density of red points (high air assistance) at middle height, 

increasing the risk of droplets travelling far away from the target area. This tendency is also observed 

in the lower part of the figure, where values obtained with air injection nozzles has been represented. 



Sensors 2013, 13 527 

 

 

In this case, even for very low impact densities, the effect of air assistance on spray fraction far away 

of the intended target is clear. 

It is important to remark that this research allows determining the spray cloud density, being 

difficult to equate a single LIDAR impact with a unique droplet [34]. In this case this study evaluates 

the spray cloud density and its relation with the total amount of liquid exceeding the target canopy. 

Following the same structure previously explained, Figure 9 represents the comparative 

measurement of drift cloud for conventional sprayer at low air assistance (27,507 m3·h−1), and  

multi-row sprayer (6,423 m3·h−1). It is clearly observed that green points (which correspond to the 

multi-row sprayer) are much more concentrated close to the canopy (left part of the graphic 

corresponding to a zenithal view). This positive effect of lower risk of soil deposition far away of the 

canopy can be combined with less impact density from the multi-row sprayer (right part of the figure) 

which probably indicates a low spray amount escaping the canopy. As a consequence LIDAR 

measurements in this case represent an adequate tool/method to classify spray types according to its 

capacity to reduce drift. 

The indexes obtained from LIDAR data also show in this case a clear effect depending on the 

sprayer type. The spray cloud is wider and higher in the case of the conventional mistblower than the 

one obtained with the multi-row sprayer. Also particular differences can be observed in the spatial 

placement of the gravitational center point of both drift clouds. Specifically, the placement of 

gravitational center point is 3.5 m above the ground level for the conventional mistblower, and 1.8 m 

above the ground for the drift cloud generated with the multi-row sprayer. This fact can be related with 

the potential risk of contamination of zones away from the sprayed area. 

Figure 9. Plan (left) and elevation view (right) of drift cloud measured with LIDAR 

comparing conventional mistblower (red) and multi-row sprayer (green) both equipped 

with conventional nozzles and using low air flow rates. Maximum height, maximum length 

and gravitational center point are also represented for the LIDAR impacts’ cloud Note that

type) are compared in order to evaluate the most adequate method for drift measurements. Curves in 

pairs (LIDAR and test bench deposition) were compared by calculating the correlation coefficient (r). 

Table 3 shows the obtained values.

Figure 10 represents the curves (three replicates) obtained with test bench and with LIDAR data 

after the application of the simulated droplet’s deposition previously described. 

The upper part of the Figure 10 (first to lines of graphics) corresponds to the conventional sprayer 

equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles at low air flow rate. Good correlation between curves 

was obtained in the three cases, with values of the correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.85 to 0.94 

(Table 3). In all cases, the biggest drift fraction was detected in the first 5 m of the measurement zone, 

close to the spray pass and canopy, and also it was observed a constant reduction of deposition after 

these 5.0 m. This reduction is much more intense in case of the LIDAR measurements.

Figure 10. Cont. 

 

The lower part of Figure 10 represents the spray deposit when air injection nozzles were mounted in 

the conventional sprayer, maintaining the low value of air flow rate. A detailed analysis of these 

graphics gives a clear indication of the high deposition measured in the collectors (test bench) placed 

close to the canopy (vine). In all cases (replicates) the deposition values went up to 2 g·cm−2, higher 
than those obtained with conventional hollow cone nozzles but placed in all cases in the first 5 m from 

the canopy. The last row of graphics represents the translated LIDAR impacts to the test bench 

deposition using air injection nozzles. In all replicates a very low deposition was measured, being 

difficult to compare with values obtained with the test bench. This fact can be related with the previous 

explanation about the low LIDAR impacts obtained when sprayer was equipped with air injection 

nozzles, which can generate mistakes in the interpretation of the results, assuming low drift values 

when using high droplet sizes. It must be considered that big droplets contains higher spray liquid that 

the smaller ones. These difficulties in drift measurements using LIDAR have been previously reported 

(14, 28). However, LIDAR represents a good alternative for a quick and less time consuming drift 

evaluation processes.  

Figure 11 follows the same structure as described for Figure 10, representing, in this case, the 

results obtained with conventional mistblower at the highest air flow rate (34,595 m3·g·g·h−1). The 

effect of air flow rate on drift potential can be observed especially in the case of air injection nozzles 

(lower part of the graphic). Higher values of tracer deposit were found far away of the canopy 

placement as a consequence of the high air flow rate and air velocity, independently of the nozzle type 

installed on the sprayer. Also in this case, values of deposition obtained after LIDAR measurements 

were, particularly in the case of air injection nozzles, very low and not very well related with those 

obtained with the test bench. Again in this case, laser beam impacts were affected by droplet density. 

Correlation coefficients obtained after comparison of both drift measurement methods gave interesting 

values (from 0.60 to 0.87) with conventional hollow cone nozzles, also for high air flow rate. The 



Sensors 2013, 13 530 

 

 

worst correlation between the two proposed methods was observed again in the case of air injection 

nozzles, due to the difficulty of laser beam to detect less dense cloud of big droplets. 

Figure 11. Curves of spray deposit (test bench and LIDAR) obtained with conventional 

mistblower at high air flow rate. Part (a) represents to conventional hollow cones and  

part (b) represents to air injection nozzles. 

 

 

Figure 12 shows a good relationship between the measured deposits obtained with the two proposed 

methods. In this case, as the spray liquid exceeding the canopy, using the multi-row sprayer, is 

expected to be lower than that generated by the conventional mistblower, both methods gave similar 

results. Also it is interesting to remark the high deposit measured in the area close to the canopy, as it 

was shown in Figures 8 and 9. 



Sensors 2013, 13 531 

 

 

Following the main objective of this research, curves represented in Figures 10 to 12 indicate the 

predicted deposit of the spray cloud measured by LIDAR, being those compared with the real 

deposition values using artificial collectors. 

Moreover, it is worth noting in this case the good correlation calculated between the two 

proposed methods, with values of correlation coefficient higher than 0.90 in all cases 

(Table 3). The interpretation of Figures 10, 11 and 12 must be done taking into account that 

LIDAR measurements allows to obtain values of impact’s density, being those values 

linked to the amount of liquid exceeding the canopy target. Nevertheless, LIDAR 

measurements cannot be linked to droplet size [34].

sprayer equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles. Upper part of the figure 

represents the curves in test bench and lower part the curves obtained after LIDAR 

measurements. 

 

4. Conclusions 

In general the use of the LIDAR sensor represents an interesting and easy technique to establish the 

potential drift of a specific sprayer settings and environmental conditions. LIDAR system provides an 

idealized optical view of spray droplet escaping the canopy and its distribution away from the target. 

Furthermore, it allows to evaluating drift with less labor, cost and time than other current methods. 

The use of test bench for drift measurement allows quantification of the amount of spray fraction 

escaping the canopy but the time required for the process is much higher than the one dedicated to 

LIDAR measurements. 

In general, good correlation has been observed between the measured drift cloud with LIDAR and 

deposition distribution obtained on the artificial collectors placed in the test bench. However, it seems 

that drift measurements using LIDAR can be affected by droplet size. 



Sensors 2013, 13 532 

 

 

The two proposed methods for drift measurement have shown potential in discriminating the effect 

of the different working parameters (nozzle type, air velocity and type of sprayer) on the drift. 

However, the results indicate a better ability of LIDAR sensor to evaluate spray drift in case of dense 

drift cloud. Additionally, further research should be arranged in order to assess the effect of sprayer’s 

settings in the final droplet size in field conditions. 

This technique will help the users to adjust an adequate deposition in the whole canopy according to 

the specifications of the treatment and could be used as a drift predictor tool depending on the target 

geometry, also in accordance with [25].
