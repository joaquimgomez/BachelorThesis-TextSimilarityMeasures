Abstract: In this study, the antioxidant activity of the Convolvulus arvensis Linn (CA) 

ethanol extract has been evaluated by different ways. The antioxidant activity of the extract 

assessed by 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical cation, 

the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power 

(FRAP) was 1.62 mmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g DW, 1.71 mmol TE/g DW and  

2.11 mmol TE/g DW, respectively. CA ethanol extract exhibited scavenging activity against 

the methoxy radical initiated by the Fenton reaction and measured by Electron Paramagnetic 

Resonance (EPR). The antioxidant effects of lyophilised CA measured in beef patties 

containing 0.1% and 0.3% (w/w) CA stored in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) (80% 

O2 and 20% CO2) was determined. A preliminary study of gelatine based film containing 

CA showed a strong antioxidant effect in preventing the degradation of lipid in muscle food. 

Thus, the present results indicate that CA extract can be used as a natural food antioxidant.

1. Introduction 

Free radicals produced in the human body result from natural biochemical reactions and, together 

with external attacks due to stress, smoke and unbalanced diets, among other factors, could cause an 

imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. For this reason, it is necessary to supplement the diet with 

antioxidant based food. This excess of radicals is associated with aging and many diseases such as heart 

problems, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorder and cancers. Previous studies indicate that the 

consumption of plant foods rich in antioxidants is beneficial for health and helps to prevent degenerative 

processes which contribute to many diseases [1–3]. Due to the increasing awareness of the benefits of 

consuming healthy food, many food companies are using antioxidants as an alternative approach, instead 

of using synthetic preservatives which at high doses may have toxic effects on the consumer. 

Natural antioxidants are compounds, generally from plants, that are used as food additives with the 

aim of inhibiting oxidation of the product [4]. Thus, the use of natural antioxidants as preservatives to 

maintain quality and nutritional traits is increasingly widespread, mainly in food that contains high levels 

of lipids, such as meat products. Therefore, the incorporation of natural antioxidants such as herbs could 

be an economical strategy to develop healthier meat products. Moreover, they can improve technological 

properties, as well as increase the eco-efficiency [5] in the food industry. Besides formulation of food 

with a natural antioxidant strategy, active packaging is also gaining interest for its potential to provide 

food quality and safety benefits. The combination of natural preservatives and biodegradable plastic into 

one food packaging formulation is a promising approach to extending product shelf life [6]. 

Plants rich in polyphenol constituents possess antioxidant activity by free radical scavenging. For 

instance, green tea can inhibit lipid peroxidation and chelate transition metals, consequently helping to 

prevent degenerative diseases. If incorporated into an edible film, it could help to maintain the quality 

of food products [7]. 

Convolvulus arvensis Linn (CA) is an annual (or sometimes perennial climber), commonly found as 

a weed throughout Europe and Asia. This plant is being used for many purposes. The root and the resin 

are cholagogue, diuretic, laxative and purgative [8]. The flower is laxative, used as a tea infusion and 

also in treatment of wounds and fever, whereas the leaf can be helpful during the menstrual period [9]. 

Meanwhile, Meng et al. showed that the ubiquitous CA extract could be considered as a promising  

anti-cancer agent, with over 50% inhibition of tumor growth activity at non-toxic doses [10]. CA also 

provided an immunostimulant effect when tested on rabbits and turned out to have cytotoxic effects on 

human cancerous cells [11,12]. In a preliminary study, Thrakal et al. reported the antioxidant activity of 

CA extract using the DPPH method, nitric oxide scavenging activity and the reducing power  

assay [13]. Furthermore, the CA extract showed abundant traces of phenolic compounds including  

p-hydrobenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, benzoic acid and ferulic acid [14]. This high content of 

phenolic compounds may allow it to serve as an antioxidant source for the food industry. However, the 

antioxidant activity of the CA extract towards lipid oxidation has not been fully determined yet. Thus, 

our goals were (1) to evaluate the antioxidant activity of CA using in vitro assays including FRAP, 



Antioxidants 2015, 4 172 

 

 

TEAC, ORAC and EPR scavenging activity and (2) to demonstrate the ability of CA extract to inhibit 

lipid deterioration in beef meat, by adding the dry extract directly in the patty composition or in the 

formulation with active packaging. One of the components in CA is an alkaloid, which is a compound 

that exhibits anti-cancer activity but may display toxic effects in the host at high doses. Therefore, the 

extraction of CA has been carried out according to the method described by Meng et al. [10] to reduce 

the presence of alkaloid in the extract before adding the lyophilized extract directly into the beef. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Plant Material 

Commercial dried CA was kindly supplied by Pàmies Hortícoles (Balaguer, Spain), a registered 

herbal company. All reagents and solvents used were of analytical grade and obtained from Panreac 

(Barcelona, Spain) and Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, England). 

2.2. Extraction of CA Extract 

Dried roots of CA were finely ground using a standard kitchen food processor. Ground CA was 

extracted in three different ways: (1) with 50:50 (v/v) ethanol:water; (2) with 75:25 (v/v) ethanol:water 

and (3) with 90:10 (v/v) ethanol:water, always in the ratio 1:30 (w/v). The extractions were performed 

at 4 °C ± 1 °C for 24 h, in the dark with constant stirring. The extract solutions of CA were recovered 

by filtration using Whatman Filter paper, 0.45 μm (Whatman, GE healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA). 

Part of the supernatant was taken for subsequent use to determine the antiradical capacity. The volume 

of the remaining supernatant was measured and the excess of ethanol was removed under vacuum using 

a rotary evaporator (Buchi Re111, Switzerland) and kept frozen at −80 °C for 24 h. All extracts were 

dried in a freeze dryer (Unicryo MC2L −60 °C, Germany) under vacuum at −60 °C for three days to 

remove moisture. Finally, lyophilised CA was weighed to determine the soluble solids concentration 

(g/L) as described by Zhang et al. [15]  

2.3. Determination of the Total Phenolic Content (TPC) 

The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenolic content (TPC) as reported by 

Santas et al. [16]. 

2.4. Determination of Free Radical Scavenging Activity Assays 

2.4.1. In-Vitro Antioxidant Capacity Determination 

Three different methods were used for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the extracts:  

2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid TEAC assay [17], Oxygen Radical Absorbance 

Capacity (ORAC) assay [18] and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) method [19]. Results were 

expressed as μM of Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry weight of plant (DW).

2.4.2. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy Radical Scavenging Assay 

EPR radical scavenging activity was measured following the method described by  

Azman et al. [20]. The extraction was executed in MeOH in 1:10 (w/v) ratio and the soluble 

concentration of CA was determined according to the procedure above. The spin-trapping reaction 

mixture consisted of 100 μL of DMPO (35 mM); 50 μL of H2O2 (10 mM); 50 μL CA extract at different 

concentrations or 50 μL of ferulic acid used as reference (0–20 g/L) or 50 μL of pure MeOH used as a 

control; and, finally, 50 μL of FeSO4 (2 mM), added in this order. The final solutions  

(125 μL) were passed through a narrow (inside diameter = 2 mm) quartz tube and introduced into the 

cavity of the EPR spectrometer. The spectrum was recorded 10 min after the addition of the FeSO4 

solution, when the radical adduct signal is greatest. 

 X-band EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker EMX-Plus 10/12 spectrometer under the following 

conditions: microwave frequency, 9.8762 GHz; microwave power, 30.27 mW; center field, 3522.7 G; 

sweep width, 100 G; receiver gain, 5.02 × 104; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 

1.86 G; time constant, 40.96 ms; conversion time, 203.0 ms. 

2.5. Determination of Antioxidant Activity in Food Model 

2.5.1. Preparation of Beef Patties 

The meat consisted of flank of beef provided by “Embutidos La Masia”, Barcelona. It was collected 

seven days after slaughter to allow it to mature and was kept at approximately −20 °C for further 

treatment. The extraction of CA was carried out according to the method used by Meng et al. to remove 

alkaloid compounds [10]. Fat and joint tissues were trimmed off lean meat (2000 g) and the meat was 

minced through 8 mm industrial plates. Then, the minced meat was divided into four batches and mixed 

with 1.5% of NaCl and either (i) control (no addition), (ii) 0.1% BHT, (iii) 0.1% lyophilised CA, (iv) 

0.3% lyophilised CA. All batches were mixed vigorously for 2 min to attain an even distribution of 

additives throughout the meat. Each sample was moulded into smaller portions (about 20 g each), stuffed 

and packed with polystyrene B5-37 (Aerpack) trays and placed in BB4L bags (Cryovac) of low gas 

permeability (8–12 cm3·m−2 per 24 h). The air in the packaged trays was flushed with 80:20 (v/v) O2:CO2 

by EAP20 mixture (Carburos Metalicos, Barcelona). Samples were stored in the dark at 4 °C ± 2 °C for 

10 days and the samples were analysed for oxidation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) 

method, % metmyoglobin, colour, pH and microbial quality. Every measurement was carried out in 

triplicate each day for 10 days (except for microbiological analysis which was done every three days). 

2.5.2. TBARS Assay 

The TBARS method was used to measure the extent of lipid oxidation over the storage period as 

described by Grau et al. [21]. Samples (1 g) were weighed in a tube and mixed with 3 g/L aqueous 

EDTA. Then, the sample was immediately mixed with 5 mL of thiobarbituric acid reagent using an 

Ultra-Turrax (IKA, Germany); at 32,000 rpm speed, for 2 min. All procedures were carried out in the 

dark and all samples were kept in ice. The mixture was incubated at 97 ± 1 °C in hot water for  

10 min and shaken for 1 min during the process to form a homogeneous mixture. The liquid sample was 



Antioxidants 2015, 4 174 

 

 

recovered by filtration (Whatman Filter paper, 0.45 μm), and then it was cooled for 10 min. The 

absorbance value of each sample was measured at 531 nm using a spectrophotometer. The  

TBARS value was calculated from a malonaldehyde (MDA) standard curve prepared with  

1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane and analysed by linear regression. All results were reported in mg 

malonaldehyde per kg of sample (mg MDA/kg sample). 

2.5.3. Colour Measurement 

Objective measurements of colour were performed using a CR 400 colorimeter (Minolta, Osaka, 

Japan). Each patty was cut and the colour of the slices was measured three times at each point. A portable 

colorimeter with the settings: pulsed xenon arc lamp, 0° viewing angle geometry and aperture size 8 

mm, was used to measure meat colour in the CIELAB space (Lightness, L*; redness, a*; yellowness, b* 

(CIE, 1978). Before each series of measurements, the instrument was calibrated using a white ceramic tile. 

2.5.4. Percentage of Metmyoglobin 

The metmyoglobin method was based on that developed by Xu et al. [22]. Five grams of beef patties 

were homogenized with 25 mL of ice-cold 0.04 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 15 s using a 

homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax, IKA, Germany), which was set at speed setting 2 (18,000 rpm). The 

homogenised patty was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 4500 g for 20 min at 4 °C 

using a high-speed freezing centrifuge (GI-20G, Anke, Shanghai, China). The absorbance of the filtered 

supernatant was read at 572, 565, 545, and 525 nm with a spectrometer (Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, 

Germany). The percentage of metmyoglobin was determined using the formula: MetMb (%) = [−2.514 

(A572/A525) + 0.777 (A565/A525) + 0.8 (A545/A525) + 1.098] × 100 

2.5.5. Development of Gelatin-Film with Antioxidant Coating 

The fabrication of gelatin based film with antioxidant coating was adapted and characterized from 

Bodini et al. [23]. While the filmogenic solution was cooled after the solubilization of sorbitol, 0.75% 

(w/w) of CA extract / gelatin and 0.1% (w/w) BHT/gelatin were added. 

2.6. Statistical Analysis 

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using Minitab 16 software program 

(Minitab Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia) (α = 0.05). The results were presented as mean values (n ≥ 3). 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Analysis of Total Polyphenols and Free Radical Activity Assays 

On average, a higher weight of soluble solids was extracted from CA with 50% ethanol than with 

75% and 90% of ethanol. The use of ethanol as extraction solvent is due to the fact that the solvent is 

recognized as a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) component which can be safely used for 

applications in the food industry [24]. Ethanol also turned out to be effective in the extraction of 

flavonoids and their glycosides, catechols and tannins from raw plant materials. Generally, CA extracted 



Antioxidants 2015, 4 175 

 

 

with 50% ethanol showed higher phenolic content and antioxidant activity values in ORAC, FRAP and 

TEAC. Our results showed that the total phenolic content correlated with the antioxidant activity 

determined by the assays. Nevertheless, the values obtained in the ORAC assay were higher than the 

ones in the FRAP and TEAC assays, which also showed the extract scavenging activity against peroxy 

radicals (OOH•) generated in the assay. Total phenolic content reported for the plant extract with ethyl 

acetate turned out to be higher than our present results with 244 mg GAE/g DW [24]. The presence of 

compounds with antioxidant potential in the ethanol extract (Table 1) was revealed in the measurement 

of total antioxidant capacity in this study. In previous studies, the antioxidant activity of CA has been 

analyzed using the DPPH method, nitric oxide scavenging activity and reducing power assay applied to 

both methanol and ethyl acetate solvent extracts [13,25]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 

report of the antioxidant activity of CA extracts assessed using the TEAC, ORAC and FRAP methods.

3.2. EPR Scavenging Radical Assay 

The EPR radical scavenging method has been developed by Azman et al. to evaluate the concentration 

of free methoxy radicals (CH3O
•) generated in the Fenton reaction with the CA extract [20]. Figure 1 

shows the decreasing signal of EPR with the increase of CA extract concentration. The free radical 

scavenging activity of CA extracts was investigated against methoxy (CH3O
•) radical by a competitive 

method in the presence of DMPO as spin trap, using EPR spectroscopy. CH3O
• was generated according 

to the Fenton procedure with a relatively short half-life that was identified by EPR because of its ability 

to form a stable nitroxide adduct with DMPO, DMPO-OCH3 (hyperfine splitting constants, aN = 13.9 G 

and aH = 8.3 G). This stable DMPO-OCH3 compound can be detected by the double integration value of 

the signal from EPR. The presence of CA extract at different concentrations may compete with the spin 

trap in the scavenging of methoxy radicals. Thus, the effect reduces the amount of radical adducts and, 

accordingly, reduces the intensity of the EPR signal. The best fitting with intensity of EPR signal was 

shown as an exponential function (Figure 1) that, if concentration values are in g/L, corresponds to 

Equation (1):  

y = 48.856 e−0.001 x; R2 = 0.953 (1) 

The graph indicates that the exponential value of the signal of the spectrum decreased as the amount 

of CA increased. This study confirmed that the scavenging activity of the Convolvulus arvensis extracts 



Antioxidants 2015, 4 176 

 

 

containing polyphenol constituents could be measured by the decrease of the intensity of the spectral 

bands of the adduct DMPO-OCH3 in the EPR spectrum with the amount of antioxidant.

spectrum of the radical adduct DMPO-OCH3 generated from a solution of H2O2 (2 mM) and 

FeSO4 (0.04 mM) with DMPO (14 mM) as spin trap in MeOH as solvent. The EPR signal 

decreases with the higher antioxidant activity. 

3.3. Antioxidant Activity in Model Food 

3.3.1. Colour and % Metmyoglobin 

Meat colour is one of the most important traits that reflect the meat freshness and quality for 

consumers. The colour parameters representing lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) are 

shown in Table 2. Generally, the value of colour (L*, a* and b*) decreased as the storage time increased. 

Initial mean lightness (CIE L*) was 38.68 ± 0.87, and control sample showed the lowest value of L* at 

the end of 10 days storage. There are marginally differences in L* with all samples throughout storage 

times. The slight change of L* value in meat storage was addressed by few authors [26,27]. The decrease 

of L* value indicates that a darkening developed, which may be due to the Maillard reaction or the effect 

of moisture content, which influences lightness values [28,29].

A reduction of the a* value was experienced by all samples in 10 days’ storage (p < 0.05), indicating 

that a decrease in redness occurred in the meat. The 0.1% BHT displayed the highest value of a* during 

three days’ storage and declined gradually afterwards (p < 0.05). This finding was expected due to the 

role of BHT as a synthetic antioxidant which is used to retain colour and delay lipid oxidation in the 

meat [30]. The redness of 0.3% CA was maintained around a value of 7 during the eight days before the 

colour faded rapidly in 10 days’ storage (p > 0.05). At the end of storage, 0.3% CA showed the highest 

a* value followed by 0.1% CA (p < 0.05) and 0.1% BHT and control exhibited a low value with no 

significant difference between both samples (p > 0.05). Many features contributed to the red colour in 

the meat such as the influence of salt and oxygen composition that enhanced the red colour of beef  

patties [31,32]. The samples had an initial yellowness (b*) value of 7.42 ion that enhanced the red in 

both samples (eight days before p > 0.05). In general, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed 

in b* values in all samples throughout storage. The present findings seem to be consistent with other 

research which found that yellowness in meat patties is not influenced by storage time and packaging 

conditions [26,33]. 

The effect of CA extracts and BHT on relative MetMb percentage in beef patties are presented in 

Table 3. A significant correlation between MetMb (%) and the instrumental colour features was reported 

previously [22]. The MetMb percentage increased as the storage time increased throughout the 10 days’ 

refrigeration, whereas the control showed the highest MetMb compared to all samples. The treated 

groups of CA extract and BHT had lower (p < 0.05) proportions of MetMb compared to the control at 

the end of storage. The acceleration of colour deterioration and lipid oxidation depended on many causes, 

including storage time, type of packaging and test system. Free radicals produced by lipid oxidation in 

meat are susceptible to initiating the reaction of oxidizing oxymyoglobin (red colour) to metmyoglobin 

(brown colour) which results in the discolouration of meat during storage. Previous research has 

indicated a relationship between lipid oxidation and myoglobin oxidation or discolouration in meat 

products [22,34]. A sufficient amount of antioxidant in the sample can delay the formation of 

metmyoglobin. The scavenging ability of samples treated with antioxidant can reduce the oxidation of 

metmyoglobin acting as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals produced from oxidation of oxymyoglobin. The 

0.3% of CA extract displayed the lowest metmyoglobin percentage compared to all samples, and the 

change of % metmyoglobin was inversely proportional to the value of redness (a*). 

3.3.2. TBARS Analysis in Beef Patties 

In general, the levels of lipid oxidation in beef patties increased over time and the values followed 

the order: 0.3% CA < 0.1% BHT < 0.1% CA < Control (Figure 2). The presence of a controlled 

atmosphere with high oxygen packaging (MAP) resulted in higher TBARS values and increased the 

oxidation rate in muscle food [32,35]. No statistical difference was observed between 0.1% BHT and 

0.1% CA on any of the storage days However, the TBARS values of both samples showed significant 

differences compared to those of the control samples (p < 0.05). From seven days onwards, the control 

reached the highest TBARS values of all samples, with values greater than 1.2 mg malonaldehyde/kg 

sample. The levels of lipid oxidation were the lowest in 0.3% CA in beef patties throughout storage and 

significantly lower than for all other samples. The oxidation rate of meat patties was more reduced for a 

higher concentration of CA extract, as shown by comparison of the rates for 0.1% and 0.3% addition.

The 0.1% BHT was added for comparison with the natural antioxidant bearing in mind the FDA 

guidelines for using BHT is ≤200 ppm in meat products. The effect of CA extract on lipid oxidation in 

meat has never been reported. The active properties of CA reported by Hegab and Ghareib [14] have 

been attributed to various phenolic acids such as ferulic acid, cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid. The 

antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is closely related to the hydroxyl group linked to the aromatic 

ring which is capable of donating hydrogen atoms with electrons and neutralizing free radicals. This 

mechanism blocks further degradation by oxidation to form MDA, which can be measured by the 

TBARS method [36]. This study confirmed the potential of CA extract to inhibit lipid degradation in 

beef patties. 

3.3.3. TBARS Analysis in Meat under Active Packaging 

The TBARS index (Figure 3) revealed that the coating of beef patties with edible films enriched with 

antioxidants lowered the oxidation rate during 17 days’ storage. By comparison, the gelatin film without 

any added antioxidants did not display any protective effect. Lipid oxidation with respect to TBARS 

values of control, meat patties sample and those wrapped with CA and BHT incorporated film showed 

a significantly different TBARS value (p < 0.05) than the control sample. This result suggested that lipid 

oxidation in meat samples could be minimized by the use of a gelatin film containing CA probably due 

to the antioxidant activity of the CA extract. However, BHT and CA coated in gelatin film did not show 

any significant difference between the values for the different periods of storage. 

Duthie et al. demonstrated the presence of phenolic acids measured using LC-MS in chicken patties 

mixed with vegetable powders including ferulic acid, p-hydrobenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid 

and cinnamic acid [37]. In reviewing the literature, CA contained a great amount of phenolic compounds 

that may be responsible for its strong antioxidant activity in many assays. The constituents included  

p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillin, benzoic acid, ferulic acid found by Elzaawely and  

Tawata [25]. HPLC analysis done by Hegab and Ghareib showed traces of eight phenolic constituents 

including pyrogallic acid, protocatechuic acid, resorcinol, chologenic acid, caffeic acid, salicylic acid, 

p-coumaric acid and cinnamic acid [14]. These compounds lead to many pharmacological benefits to 

human health. Benzoic acid and its derivatives showed antimicrobial potential [38] while gallic acid and 

caffeic acid showed 50% inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation [39]. p-coumaric, ferulic acid and 

cinnamic acid and their derivatives bring many pharmacological benefits to humans including, 

anticancer and antioxidant effects [40,41]. Moreover, many constituents detected in the CA extract 

correlated significantly with antioxidant activity measured by ORAC and TEAC assays and have played 

an important role in the detoxification of endogenous compounds in humans [42].

4 ± 1 °C without light. Each sample was measured in triplicate and the average standard 

deviation for each sample was less than 5%. 

4. Conclusions 

The CA extract showed an excellent antioxidant activity in 50% aqueous ethanol measured by FRAP, 

TEAC and ORAC assays. This is also the first time that the radical scavenging activity has been 

evaluated in a CA extract against methoxy radical generated in the Fenton Reaction assessed  

by EPR. 

The CA extract also showed a protective effect against lipid degradation in the muscle food model. 

Lyophilised CA (0.1% and 0.3% w/w) can be applied as an antioxidant in meat patties. It showed 

inhibition of lipid oxidation in MAP. 0.3% of CA retained meat redness and browning colour measured 

by the metmyoglobin assay which was much better than the control (p < 0.05) during  

10 days’ storage. A preliminary study of gelatin based film coated with CA showed there was a 

significant delay in the lipid degradation in beef (p < 0.05). Therefore, this study confirmed that CA 

could be used by the food industry as a source of antioxidants.
