1  INTRODUCTION 

EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) requires the gradual reduction of biodegradable municipal waste going to 
landfills. In this context, three mechanical-biological treatments (MBT) plants were designed and installed 
progressively in Barcelona Metropolitan Area (Catalonia, NE Spain) during 2000s. These facilities were intended to 
solve the problem of municipal wastes generated in this region (Table 1), especially to stabilise OM (organic matter) 
from MSW (municipal solid waste). Near to 600.000 tn/year of OF (organic fraction) is estimated to be produced in 
Barcelona Metropolitan Area but currently, a rough fourth part of it is separately collected (SC) to be biologically 
treated. However, it is worth noting that for both cases collection of plastic, glass and, paper and cardboard is 
provided. This means that most of the OF contained in MSW must be mechanically selected in the treatment plants. 
In general, the low recovered OF is explained by the low participation of the population in source sorted collection 
policies of OF, despite the application of the current legislation in Catalonia (Law 6/93 and Law 9/2008 on waste 
regulation), which obliges to sorted this fraction at source.

 Table 2 shows the main characteristics of the three facilities currently in operation in Barcelona 
Metropolitan Area, which treat organic fraction from two different types: source separated collection and 
mechanical sorting at facility. Facilities 1 and 2 combine anaerobic digestion and composting processes, whereas 
facility 3 only applies anaerobic digestion. In 2010, a fourth plant is under construction. The total capacity of the 
three installations are treating less than 40% of the total municipal waste generated in the area, but there are some 
other composting plants in the Metropolitan Area that treat part of the organic waste produced, while the rest is 
destined to other treatments. An important data to be considered in relation to their process is the amount of reject

produced as a result of the mechanical selection and also of the final operations of digestate and compost 
production. 
 The general aim of this work was to assess the operation of these 3 facilities. In particular, we studied (1) 
the quality of the OF, based on % of non fermentable materials (or impurities), from source sorted collection (SC) 
and also from mechanical sorting (MS) at facility, (2) characteristics of organic fraction and middle products of 
biological processes and (3) quality of obtained compost. 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1  Sampling methodology 

Like this facilities are very complex, a good knowledge of the whole process and a good approach on the sampling 
points is crucial to provide an easy development of sampling and to ensure that a representative samples are taken. 
So, first step was to determine the material flow through the facility. The contact with managers and their 
knowledge about the biological process were essential to achieve this purpose. 

Samples of the whole process were taken from the three facilities. Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of 
the processes conducted in a generic facility of combined biological treatment, and sampling points labelled with 
grey dots. Two main lines can be observed depending on the selection treatment: (1) source sorted municipal solid 
waste organic fraction (OF-SC line) and (2) non source sorted municipal solid waste organic fraction (OF-MS line). 
In both lines, anaerobic digestion and composting treatments were carried out, so that it is obtained four different 
composts: (a) compost from composting organic fraction separately collected (OFSC-C), (b) compost from 
anaerobic digestion of organic fraction separately collected (OFSC.AD-C), (c) compost from composting organic 
fraction mechanical sorted in the same plant (OFMS-C) and (d) compost from anaerobic digestion of organic 
fraction mechanical sorted (OFMS.AD-C).

2.2  Sampling methodology 

(a) Quantification of the % of impurities and % of OF in solid samples was conducted on wet sample, sorting them 
by hand and weighing them to calculate their proportion in relation to the total mass considered. 
 (b)Solid and semi-solid samples: EC (dS m-1) and pH were measured from water extract (1:5 w/v) on wet 
samples, using a pH electrode and an electrical conductivity probe, respectively. Water extractable ammonium 
(NH4+-N, g kg-1 dry weight basis) was measured in the same extract using a specific ion electrode.  The 
characterisation of the organic fraction was carried out on the dry (105ºC to a constant weight) and milled samples. 
Results are expressed in g kg-1 dry weight basis. Total organic matter (TOM) was determined by weight loss on 
ignition heating for 4 h in a muffle furnace at 560°C. Mineral matter (%MM) is %MM=100-%TOM. Organic 
nitrogen (% org-N) was determined with a specific ion electrode after Kjeldahl digestion. C/N was calculated by 
dividing OM/2 (Zucconi and de Bertoldi, 1987; Saña et al., 1989). Parameters relating to organic matter and 
nitrogen stabilisation (ROM, SD, nh-N and rN) were conducted according to Klason modified method (López, 
2010) and Saña et al. (1989): ROM and nh-N were determined as TOM and org-N in the dried residue obtained after 
two successive sulphuric acid hydrolyses (one in a cool for 3 hours with 72% H2SO4 followed by a second boiling 
hydrolysis under reflux for 5 hours in H2SO4 0,7N). Stability degree (SD) expresses the percentage of ROM with 
respect to TOM content and resistant nitrogen (rN) expresses the percentage of nH-N relative to org-N content.  
Heavy metals (expressed as g kg-1 dry weight basis) were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after 
dissolution of ashes (ignition at 470ºC) in 3N HNO3.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1 Quality of the organic fraction 
Impurities content in organic fraction in biological treatment plants can be highly variable depending on season and 
local areas, but above all, on the efficiency of the source sorted collection system (ARC, 2010). The results in table 
3 reflect the inadequate participation of population in source sorted organic fraction collection since the percentage 
of impurities is high, especially in these facilities. It should be notice that these percentages are usually higher than 
those ones showed by the average presented by the organic fractions treated in the rest of the Catalan SC 
composting facilities.

with the total of Catalan composting plants (ARC, 2010)

2008 22±1,14 10±1,00  11±0,26 

 
The quantification of the % of impurities and OF done from a total of 200kg of fresh sample (unloaded 

from lorries randomly selected in F 1), showed a lower proportion of OF in the SC (58,6%) coming from the streets 
than in the SC coming form markets (91,2%). The remaining percentage corresponded to refuse, mainly plastic from 
packaging. 

On other hand, mechanical selection systems in each facility are different, which can affect the selection 
of organic fraction before starting the biological treatment. The characterization of the refuse obtained after 
mechanical selection (figure 1) in both lines OF-SC and OF-MS, pointed out that the refuse from OF-SC line 
contained a 25,4% of organic matter yet, that has not been recovered through mechanical selection and which final 
destination is landfiling or incineration. In OF-MS line, only a 7,4% of OF was detected in the refuse but this figure 
could be associated with a lower OM content of MSW (in relation to SC) than with a higher efficiency of MSW 
selection. 

These results show that the mechanical selection, besides needing larger surface and investment for the 
selection devices, it seems not be as effective as source sorted collection made by citizens. In fact, effectiveness in 
source collection can be noticed in a small plant (in the municipality of Malla), involved in door by door collection 
of organic waste, which results for 2009 showed an average of impurities of 1±0,07% (ARC, 2010). 

3.2 OF-SC, OF-MS and digestate characterization 
Organic fraction after mechanical selection (OF-SC and OF-MS) showed different characteristics from those 
observed for SC in our previous work (López et al., 2010) where the organic fraction was analyzed at arrival in bags 
to the OF SC composting plants. The main differences were lower contents in moisture and organic matter, and 
higher heavy metal contents (Table 4). On the other hand, it should be noticed that similar heavy metal levels were 
observed between OF-SC and OF-MS in F1 and F2, and clearly higher than those observed in SC.  

Digestates from these plants (Table 5) result in a higher pH respect the observed in organic fraction 
(Table 4). For all digestate samples, a high content in ammonium was detected. Moisture content is according to the 
technology applied, resulting in lower content in F 2, whose anaerobic digestion is conducted on dry (Table 2). 
Digestates TOM contents are lower in F 2 and 3 than in F 1, suggesting a slighter degradation during AD in F 1. 
Moreover, organic nitrogen content results higher in F 3. Heavy metal content seems to be higher in F 3 than in F 1 
and 2.  

3.2.1 Compost quality 
In relation to compost quality from materials coming from anaerobic digestion, it must be considered that F 3 only 
produces digestate but not compost. Table 6 shows the differences in composts between F 1 and 2, and they are 
compared with compost from not digested source sorted collection of organic fraction (OF-C) obtained from 
different facilities and with compost from not digested MSW (MS-C) of other plants.

Slight differences between the composts from these plants were observed and no clear relation can be 
established in relation to the origin of the raw material (source collection or not) or to treatment applied in plant 
(anaerobic digestion or not). This apparent homogeneity could be attributed to the fact that both lines are not 
properly differentiate along the process. Compost from these plants was similar to those obtained in MS facilities. In 
relation to OF-C present a higher N-NH4+ and heavy metal content, and lower nitrogen (orgN and NnH) and 
stability.  Organic matter results different from products, and in F 2 it can be noticed that compost without previous 
digestion of OF shows higher values of TOM. Heavy metal content does not seem to differ between these plants 
samples and, in relation to Spanish regulation (RD824/2005) the use of these composts is restricted, and attending to 
the maximum limit established should be landfilled. 

 

4 CONCLUSIONS 

− Mechanical separation systems used to obtain a suitable initial material to perform anaerobic digestion, 
despite having been optimized, seems not to have enough efficacy considering their high economical cost, 
large space occupation and high content of rejects with a high organic matter content.  

− Lines for SC and for MS seem to be not sufficiently differentiated. For this reason, neither digestate nor the 
final compost showed the expected differences according to the type of starting material, including heavy 
metal content. 



 Technologies/systems for different manure and organic waste treatment options 

  

− The fact that the obtained products are very low in quality, especially in relation to heavy metal content 
indicates that the compost obtained in this type of facilities should be landfilled rather than be used as 
organic amendments.
