Abstract

Background: The impact of nutritional status and diet composition on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in fish remains largely unknown. To identify biomarkers of interest in nutritional studies, herein we
obtained a deep-coverage transcriptome by 454 pyrosequencing of liver and skeletal muscle cDNA normalised
libraries from long-term starved gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and fish fed different diets.

Results: After clean-up of high-throughput deep sequencing reads, 699,991 and 555,031 high-quality reads allowed
de novo assembly of liver and skeletal muscle sequences, respectively (average length: 374 and 441 bp; total
megabases: 262 and 245 Mbp). An additional incremental assembly was completed by integrating data from both
tissues (hybrid assembly). Assembly of hybrid, liver and skeletal muscle transcriptomes yielded, respectively, 19,530,
11,545 and 10,599 isotigs (average length: 1330, 1208 and 1390 bp, respectively) that were grouped into 15,954,
10,033 and 9189 isogroups. Following annotation, hybrid transcriptomic data were used to construct an
oligonucleotide microarray to analyse nutritional regulation of the expression of 129 genes involved in OXPHOS in
S. aurata. Starvation upregulated cytochrome c oxidase components and other key OXPHOS genes in the liver,
which exhibited higher sensitive to food deprivation than the skeletal muscle. However, diet composition affected
OXPHOS in the skeletal muscle to a greater extent than in the liver: most of genes upregulated under starvation
presented higher expression among fish fed a high carbohydrate/low protein diet.

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the expression of coenzyme Q-binding protein (COQ10), cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 6A2 (COX6A2) and ADP/ATP translocase 3 (SLC25A6) in the liver, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit
5B isoform 1 (COX5B1) in the liver and the skeletal muscle, are sensitive markers of the nutritional condition that
may be relevant to assess the effect of changes in the feeding regime and diet composition on fish farming.

Background
A major advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technology is the ability to provide a huge amount of
gene expression data due to its high throughput [1–3].
Among NGS approaches, massive 454 sequencing has
become a feasible method for increasing sequencing
depth and coverage. Following the pyrosequencing
method [4], sequencing error levels in the 454 platform
are low (< 1%), arising primarily because of homopoly-
mer runs, but these errors tend to be resolved with suffi-
cient coverage depth to allow assembly of overlapping
reads. Expressed sequence tag (EST) projects in fish
started in the late 90s with the model species zebrafish,
Danio rerio [5, 6] and medaka, Oryzias latipes [7]. More
recently, transcriptomic analyses have been developed
for fish species of interest in aquaculture such as Atlan-
tic cod, Gadus morhua [8–10], Atlantic salmon, Salmo
salar [11, 12], common carp, Cyprinus carpio [13], rain-
bow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss [14], Senegalese sole,
Solea senegalensis, and common sole, Solea solea [15],
and gilthead sea bream larvae, Sparus aurata [16–18],
among others. S. aurata is the most cultured marine fish
in Europe, accounting for 46% of total aquaculture pro-
duction of marine fish in 2015 [19]. Despite the com-
mercial interest of S. aurata production, currently
available transcriptomic data for S. aurata provide par-
tial information and limited support to identify genes of
potential biotechnological interest in nutritional studies.
Remarkable efforts to obtain transcriptomic data from S.
aurata juveniles have been carried out by Calduch-Giner
et al. [20] through sequencing 454 normalised libraries
of skeletal muscle, intestine, blood and head kidney
(prior and post exposure to infection with the myxos-
porean parasite Enteromyxum leei) RNA samples of S.
aurata fed with commercial diets, combined with previ-
ous data obtained from animals exposed to confinement
stress, parasite infection and nutritional stress by essen-
tial fatty acid deficiency. The authors yielded 125,263
unique sequences with an average length of 727 bp en-
coding for 21,384 gene descriptions. Assembled contigs
ranged from 7808 to 14,008 depending on the tissue li-
brary. Additional contributions were performed by Gar-
cia de la Serrana et al. [21], who analysed the skeletal
muscle transcriptome of fish fed a commercial diet and
submitted to short-term fasting at various rearing tem-
peratures; Vieira et al. [22], who analysed the skeleton
transcriptome by sequencing RNA samples from verte-
brae and gill arches; and Sarropoulou et al. [18], who se-
quenced brain samples of S. aurata submitted to early-
life events during the larval phase. To our knowledge,
no tissues from S. aurata kept under different nutri-
tional conditions such as long-term starvation and par-
tial substitution of dietary protein by carbohydrates and
lipids have been included for the generation of cDNA

libraries and sequencing of ESTs collections using NGS.
Therefore, current publicly available data for S. aurata is
most likely to underrepresent genes involved in meta-
bolic adaptation to long-term starvation and changes in
the composition of dietary nutrients.
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is essential for

transferring energy from substrate oxidation to ATP pro-
duction in mitochondria, providing approximately 90% of
the cellular energy. The OXPHOS system comprises com-
plexes I to IV of the respiratory electron transport chain,
which generates an electrochemical proton gradient by
pumping protons across the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane with the aid of ubiquinone (CoQ) and cytochrome c
as mobile electron carriers, and the reversible proton pump
F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V), which couples proton re-
flux into the mitochondrial matrix to generate ATP from
ADP and phosphate. Cytochrome c oxidase (or complex
IV) catalyses the terminal step of the electron transport
chain (reduction of molecular oxygen to water), which is
thought to be the rate-limiting reaction of the pathway [23,
24]. Starvation increases the rate of oxygen consumption
at about 20% in the rat liver [25], and enhances cyto-
chrome c oxidase activity in the liver of mice [26]. Starva-
tion increases OXPHOS activity in the liver of mice by
stimulating the transcription and efficiency of OXPHOS
genes in a process triggered by glucagon/cAMP signalling
[27]. Similarly, starvation impairs the glycolytic flux, re-
duces the ATP/AMP ratio and significantly enhances the
activity of cytochrome c oxidase in human fibroblasts [28].
Indeed, the ATP/ADP ratio is considered a major regulator
of the phosphorylation status and activity of cytochrome c
oxidase [24]. In fish, knowledge of the effect of starvation
on the OXPHOS pathway remains limited. In a recent re-
port, Bermejo-Nogales et al. [29] reported the effect of
10 days of starvation on the expression of 88 genes of the
OXPHOS pathway in the liver, white skeletal muscle and
cardiac muscle of S. aurata juveniles. In contrast to previ-
ous observations in mammals, 10 days of starvation down-
regulated most of OXPHOS genes in the liver of food-
deprived fish, while upregulated the expression of some
OXPHOS genes in the white skeletal muscle and cardiac
muscle.
Little is currently known about the effect of macronu-

trient composition of the diet on the expression of
OXPHOS genes. Accumulating evidence indicates that
high-fat diets decrease the expression, activity and
assembly of the five OXPHOS complexes in the liver
and skeletal muscle of mice [30–32], and partial substi-
tution of dietary protein and fat by starch significantly
increases mRNA levels of OXPHOS markers such as
ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase subunit 2 (UCR2) and
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COX4) in the liver of
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), although with ex-
pression changes <2-fold in both cases [33].

The aim of the present study was to perform massive
454 sequencing of liver and white skeletal muscle cDNA
libraries from S. aurata juveniles submitted to different
nutritional conditions (long-term starvation and feeding
diets differing in nutrient composition) in order to pro-
vide a deep-coverage RNA sequencing data for develop-
ing nutritional studies in fish. The resulting database
was used to design an oligonucleotide microarray and
analyse the effect of nutritional status and diet compos-
ition on the expression of genes involved in OXPHOS in
S. aurata.

Methods
Animals, feeding trial, sampling and growth performance
Gilthead sea bream (S. aurata) juveniles were obtained
from Piscimar (Burriana, Castellón, Spain), transported
to the laboratory, and distributed into 260 L aquaria
maintained at 21 °C and supplied with running seawater
in a closed system with active pump filter and UV lamps.
The photoperiod was adjusted to a 12 h: 12 h dark-light
cycle. Acclimation to our facilities and maintenance pro-
cedures were as previously described [34]. Previous to
sampling and to maximise representation and diversity
of transcripts of nutritional interest in the cDNA librar-
ies used for 454-pyrosequencing, fish were submitted to
six different nutritional conditions. Five groups of fish
were fed at a ration of 25 g/kg body weight once a day
(10 a.m.) for 23 days with diets that were formulated to
cover a range of macronutrients above and below the
levels in commercially available diets. Nutrient compos-
ition was adjusted to achieve similar energy levels (20 to
22 kJ/g). Diets were named HLL, MHL, MLH, LHH and
LLH, where the first, second and third letters indicate
the levels of protein, lipids and carbohydrates, respect-
ively (H: high; M: medium; L: low). The composition of
the experimental diets is shown in Table 1. A sixth
group of fish was deprived of food during the same
period of time. To prevent stress during tissue sampling,
fish were anesthetised with MS-222 (1:12,500) before
handling (9:30 a.m.) and killed by cervical section. Blood
was collected and tissue samples (liver and white skeletal
muscle extracted from the middle/dorsal region) were
dissected out, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and kept
at −80 °C until use. Specific growth rate (SGR, %/day)
was calculated according to the following expression:
SGR = (ln Wf − ln Wi) * 100/T, where Wf and Wi are
final and initial weight in grams, respectively, and T is
time in days.

RNA extraction, cDNA library construction, normalisation
and 454 sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from 30 mg of liver or
white skeletal muscle using the RNeasy tissue and
RNeasy fibrous tissue, respectively, mini kits (Qiagen,

Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. RNA concentration and purity was deter-
mined spectrophotometrically at 260/280 nm using
Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Wal-
tham, MA, USA). RNA integrity was determined with
an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples with RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) > 9.2 were used for subse-
quent studies. Pools consisting of 1 μg of total RNA
isolated from 6 individuals per condition (fasting and
feeding with diets HLL, MHL, MLH, LHH and LLH;
36 fish and RNA samples in total) were used to con-
struct liver and white skeletal muscle cDNA libraries.
The dsDNA synthesis was performed using a MINT-
Universal cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen, Moscow,
Russia). To increase the presence of rare transcripts,
the cDNAs libraries were normalised using TRIM-
MER cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen, Moscow,
Russia) following manufacturer’s instructions. Sequen-
cing of cDNAs libraries was performed using a GS
FLX 454 platform (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at the
CCiTUB of the Universitat de Barcelona (Barcelona,
Spain).

Transcriptome assembly and annotation
Pre-processing of raw reads to remove low quality bases,
primers and adapters and quality control were per-
formed using Cutadapt [35], Prinseq [36] and FastQC
(Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK). The reads
were de novo assembled using the GSAssembler soft-
ware (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Three assemblies were
performed: one for sequence data from liver, another for
white skeletal muscle, and an incremental assembly
using both liver and white skeletal muscle data (hybrid
assembly). Gene annotation of unique sequences for the
three assemblies was performed with local BLASTx and
BLASTn searches against non-redundant protein and
nucleotide sequence databases of the NCBI’s QBLAST
using GPRO software [37] with a significant threshold of
E-value <1e-4. Gene names and putative functions were
assigned to each sequence based on the highest align-
ment score among BLAST best 10 matches. GPRO soft-
ware was also used to perform functional analysis by
mapping annotated unique sequences to the Gene
Ontology (GO) database. The number of sequences as-
sociated to GO terms was calculated under the categor-
ies of biological process, molecular function and cellular
component.

Microarray design, hybridization and data analysis
An Agilent custom high-density oligonucleotide micro-
array (8 × 60 k; ID 079501; Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) was designed to contain 2 different 60-
mer probes for each of the 25,392 assembled unique se-
quences present in the S. aurata hybrid transcriptome.
Labelling, hybridisation and scanning were performed
using the Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression
Analysis v. 6.5 protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. The microarray analysis was performed using
total RNA isolated from liver and skeletal muscle from
four fish per condition (starved fish and fish fed diets
HLL, MHL and LLH). Briefly, for each sample 200 ng of
total RNA was labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 using Low Input
Quick Amp Labeling Kit. The Two-Color and RNA
Spike-In Kit, Two-Color was used to monitor microarray
workflow for linearity, sensitivity and accuracy. Labelled
cRNA was purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and quantified using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). After assessing successful dye incorporation and
sample integrity, 2.5 μg of each labelled sample was
hybridised to the custom-made oligo-microarray at 65 °
C for 17 h following Gene Expression Hybridization Kit
instructions. A double loop hybridisation with dye swap
experimental design was adopted with n = 4 fish per
condition (starvation and feeding with diets HLL, MHL
and LLH) and a total of 16 hybridisations (8 per tissue)

[38]. Scanning was performed using an Agilent Micro-
array Scanner G2565BA. Outlier spots and spot intensity
for Cy3 and Cy5 channels were extracted using Agilent
Feature Extraction software version 10.7. Loess and
Aquantile normalisation for within-and inter-array nor-
malisation, respectively, was applied using the R-
Bioconductor package [39, 40]. Data analysis was only
considered for transcriptomic annotations of OXPHOS
genes with E-value <1e-10 and HSP/hit >30. A linear
model analysis using Limma [41] was conducted to se-
lect differentially expressed genes between conditions.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
One microgram of total RNA isolated from liver or white
skeletal muscle of S. aurata was reverse-transcribed to
cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C in the
presence of random hexamer primers. The cDNA product
was used for subsequent quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR). The mRNA levels of S. aurata NADH dehydro-
genase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8
(NDUFB8), NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa
subunit (NDUFS1), coenzyme Q-binding protein COQ10
(COQ10), cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 10 isoform
A (UQCR11A), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B isoform
1 (COX5B1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6A2
(COX6A2), ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B) and
ADP/ATP translocase 3 (SLC25A6), were determined in a
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) using 0.4 μM of each primer, 10 μl
of SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA,
USA), and 1.6 μl of the diluted cDNA product in a final
volume of 18 μl. Primers to perform qPCR analysis of the
genes of interest (Table 2) were designed from sequence
data obtained in the transcriptomic analysis after filtering
for E-value <1e-10 and HSP/hit >30. To validate the amp-
lification efficiency of primers, standard curves with con-
secutive dilutions of a cDNA test sample were generated,
and PCR products were separated electrophoretically on
2% agarose gel for band size confirmation. 18S ribosomal
RNA (18S) and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) were
selected to normalise the amount of mRNA for the genes
of interest in each sample using primer pairs shown in
Table 2. Variations in gene expression were calculated by
the standard ΔΔCt method.

Statistics
Data obtained by performing qPCR were analysed by
one-way ANOVA using the SPSS software Version 22
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and are represented as
mean ± standard deviation. When statistical significance
was found for ANOVA, the Student-Newman-Keuls post
hoc test was used to determine differences among
treatments.

Results
454 pyrosequencing and assembly
To obtain a deep-coverage database useful for develop-
ing nutritional studies in S. aurata, total RNA pools
were made from the liver and skeletal muscle of 23-day
starved fish or fish fed with five different diets for the
same time period. The experimental diet HLL (High
protein, Low lipids, Low carbohydrates) has a macronu-
trient composition similar to the diet of wild S. aurata.
The other diets presented partial substitution of protein
by lipids and/or carbohydrates. Liver and white skeletal
muscle cDNA libraries were constructed, normalised to
increase the presence of rare transcripts, and subse-
quently sequenced using the 454 FLX technology. Two
sequencing runs of liver and skeletal muscle libraries
yielded 812,770 and 691,433 reads, respectively. After
clean-up and removal of primers and adapter sequences,
sequencing of liver and white skeletal muscle libraries
generated 699,991 and 555,031 high-quality reads with
an average length of 374 and 441 bp and a total of 262
and 245 Mbp sequence data, respectively. Three assem-
blies were performed: liver, white skeletal muscle and an
incremental assembly by integrating data from liver and
white skeletal muscle (hybrid transcriptome). A sum-
mary of the 454 assemblies is listed in Table 3. Unique
reads represented 96.8 and 96.4% of total reads of liver

and skeletal muscle sequencing results, respectively
(Fig. 1a). Assembly of the hybrid transcriptome was per-
formed by aligning 1,119,088 reads (89.2% of high qual-
ity reads), which generated 23,956 contigs with average
and N50 lengths of 901 bp and 1322 bp, respectively,
and 102,569 singletons. Contigs were grouped into
19,530 isotigs with average and N50 lengths of 1330 and
1536 bp, respectively, and isotigs were further grouped
into 15,954 isogroups. For the liver and skeletal muscle,
aligned reads (88.6% and 91.2% of high quality reads, re-
spectively) generated 13,313 and 12,333 contigs with an
average length of 934 bp (N50 = 1195 bp) and 1056 bp
(N50 = 1364 bp), and 43,460 and 30,302 singletons, re-
spectively. The number of isotigs constructed was
11,545 with average and N50 lengths of 1208 bp and
1315 bp, respectively, for the liver, and 10,599 isotigs
with average and N50 lengths of 1390 bp and 1491 bp,
respectively, for the skeletal muscle. Isogroups in the
liver and skeletal muscle transcriptomes were 10,033
and 9189, respectively (Table 3). Length distribution of
assembled unique sequences is shown in Fig. 1b. Liver
and white skeletal muscle transcriptomes presented 76.1
and 86.4% of unique sequences above 500 bp.

Annotation and gene ontology
In the present study, 64.3%, 73.9% and 83.1% unique se-
quences of liver, skeletal muscle and hybrid transcrip-
tomes, respectively, were annotated using BLASTx and
BLASTn against the NCBI non-redundant protein and
nucleotide collection database. To categorise gene prod-
ucts, 6162, 5581 and 4793 unique sequences of liver,

skeletal muscle and hybrid transcriptomes, respectively,
were annotated with specific GO terms. Figure 2 sum-
marises GO terms for the assembled transcriptomes at
fourth level for the categories of biological process and
cellular components, and at third level for molecular
function GO terms. GO terms distribution was similar
for the liver, skeletal muscle and hybrid transcriptomes.
Terms describing biological process were most abundant
for nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process
(GO:0006139; 17–19%), gene expression (GO:0010467;
13–14%), transport (GO:0006810; 11–12%), and signal

Microarray and gene expression analysis
With the aim of identifying new biomarkers related to
OXPHOS of interest for nutritional studies in S. aurata,
we used the obtained transcriptomic data for designing
an oligonucleotide microarray to further analyse changes
in gene expression due to long-term starvation or

feeding diets differing in macronutrient composition. To
this end, three groups of fish were fed 23 days on diets
HLL (High protein, Low lipids, Low carbohydrates; with
a macronutrient composition similar to the diet of wild
S. aurata), MHL (Medium protein, High lipids, Low car-
bohydrates; with a composition similar to commercial
diets for S. aurata culture) and LLH (Low protein, Low
lipids, High carbohydrates; with partial substitution of
protein by carbohydrate compared to the HLL diet). A
fourth group of fish was deprived of food for the same
period. Growth performance of starved fish and fish fed
diets HLL, MHL and LLH, expressed as mean SGR
(%/day) ± SD, was −0.89a ± 0.54, 2.54c ± 0.21,
2.07bc ± 0.33, and 1.43b ± 0.51, respectively (different
superscript letters indicate significant differences,
p < 0.05; n = 3 groups of 8 fish each). The expression of
a total of 129 genes involved in mitochondrial

respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP
translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane
were analysed in the liver and skeletal muscle of S. aur-
ata (Additional file 1). Despite recent efforts to increase
transcriptomic data concerning genes involved in the
OXPHOS pathway in S. aurata [29], 38 out of 129 genes
analysed in the present study are newly described genes
for S. aurata that have not been previously reported in
public databases. Long-term starvation deeply affected
the expression of an important part of analysed genes.
Considering statistical significance with an adjusted P
value <0.05, 24–38 genes (depending on the diet sup-
plied) out of 129 were significantly upregulated in the
liver of starved fish, while food restriction downregu-
lated 10–14 genes. Differentially expressed genes in the
liver included 8 upregulated and 5 downregulated sub-
units out of 42 genes associated to NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase (complex I of the electron transfer
chain), 1 upregulated and 2 downregulated subunits out
of 7 from succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), 4 up-
regulated subunits out of 14 from ubiquinol-cytochrome
c reductase (complex III), 15 upregulated and 4 down-
regulated subunits out of 34 from cytochrome c oxidase
(complex IV), 5 upregulated and 2 downregulated sub-
units out of 19 from F1F0-ATP synthase (OXPHOS
complex V), and 2 upregulated genes out of 3 ADP/ATP
translocases (Additional file 2). Food deprivation resulted
in 17–40 upregulated and 21–28 downregulated
OXPHOS genes in the skeletal muscle (Additional file 3).
Figure 5 shows a heat map hierarchical clustering of

differentially expressed genes (fish fed with diets HLL,
MHL or LLH versus starved fish) with an adjusted P
value <0.05 and with a difference of at least 2-fold in the

normalised intensity ratio (Cy5/Cy3 or Cy3/Cy5) for one
or more feeding conditions. With a fold change greater
than 2, all differentially expressed genes were upregu-
lated by starvation in the liver of S. aurata, and 6 genes
corresponded to cytochrome c oxidase subunits
(COX6A2, COX5B1, COX4I2, COX7A2, COX8B and
COX6B1). Indeed, 4 cytochrome c oxidase components
(COX6A2, COX5B1, COX4I2 and COX7A2) showed a
fold change greater than 4 regardless of the diet supplied
(fold change ranging from 4.9 to 86.7). In addition to
cytochrome c oxidase subunits, SLC25A6 and COQ10
were also found among upregulated genes with greater
fold change expression in the liver of starved fish
(SLC25A6: 44.9 to 60.1 fold change depending on the
diet supplied; and COQ10: 14.4 to 19.6 fold change). In
contrast, starvation resulted in both upregulated and
downregulated genes, 18 and 10 respectively, with a fold
change greater than 2 in the skeletal muscle. The magni-
tude of expressional changes due to starvation was lower
in the skeletal muscle than in the liver. No genes in the
skeletal muscle showed a fold change greater than 4
when compared starved fish versus fish fed diets HLL,
MHL and LLH. Remarkably, diet composition affected
the expression of OXPHOS genes in the skeletal muscle
to a greater extent than in the liver. As a general trend,
fish fed LLH exhibited higher mRNA levels than fish fed
HLL for the majority of significantly upregulated genes
in the skeletal muscle of starved fish (Additional file 3).
To validate microarray data, the mRNA levels of sev-

eral genes involved in OXPHOS were determined by
RT-qPCR in liver and skeletal muscle samples from S.
aurata submitted to long-term starvation or fed diets
differing in macronutrient composition. The mRNA

electron transfer chain (NDUFB8, NDUFS1, COQ10,
UQCR11A, COX5B1 and COX6A2), ATP synthesis
(ATP5B) and ADP/ATP translocation (SLC25A6) were
analysed. The mRNA levels of NDUFB8 and NDUFS1,
components of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, were
not affected by the nutritional condition in the liver and
the skeletal muscle. (Fig. 6a and b). The expression of
COQ10, a protein required for coenzyme Q activity in
the electron transport chain [42], was also determined in
tissue samples of treated fish. In the liver, COQ10
mRNA significantly increased after starvation, reaching
values 17-fold higher than fish fed diet HLL, and 9.3 and
10.2-fold higher than fish fed diets LLH and MHL, re-
spectively. A different regulation of COQ10 expression
was observed in the skeletal muscle by the nutritional
condition: a significant 3-fold decrease was found in
starved fish compared to those fed a high protein/low
carbohydrate diet (HLL) (Fig. 6c).

The mRNA abundance of UQCR11A and COX5B1,
components of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase and
cytochrome c oxidase, respectively, of the respiratory
chain, showed a similar behaviour as a result of starva-
tion or feeding different diets. Starvation significantly in-
creased the expression of both proteins in the liver
(UQCR11A: 1.8 and 1.9-fold compared to fish fed HLL
and MHL, respectively; and COX5B1: 3.2 to 4.5-fold
compared to fed fish regardless of the diet) and the skel-
etal muscle (1.8 to 2.0-fold for UQCR11A and 2.4 to
9.2-fold for COX5B1 compared to fed fish regardless of
the diet). Diet composition did not affect UQCR11A ex-
pression, while COX5B1 mRNA levels significantly
increased 2.9 and 3.9-fold in the skeletal muscle of fish

fed diet LLH compared to those fed HLL and MHL, re-
spectively (Fig. 6d and e).
Another component of cytochrome c oxidase, COX6A2,

was also greatly affected by food deprivation in the liver.
Starvation significantly increased the hepatic mRNA levels
of COX6A2 23.1 to 34.6-fold, depending on the diet sup-
plied. In contrast, COX6A2 expression was not affected
by the nutritional condition in the skeletal muscle (Fig. 6f).
Neither starvation nor diet composition significantly
affected the expression of ATP5B, a subunit of the cataly-
tical core of F1F0-ATP synthase, in the skeletal muscle
(Fig. 6g). SLC25A6, also known as ADP/ATP translocase
3, is a member of the solute carrier family 25 that facili-
tates the exchange of ADP and ATP across the

mitochondrial inner membrane by an antiport mechanism
[43]. In the liver, starvation significantly increased 14.3 to
19.3-fold the expression of SLC25A6 compared to fed fish.
The effect of starvation depended on the diet composition
in the skeletal muscle: fish fed diet HLL presented the
lower SLC25A6 mRNA levels, which were 7.6 and 8.2-fold
higher in fish fed diet MHL and starved fish, respectively
(Fig. 6h).

Discussion
Transcriptomic analysis
The goal of the present study was to increase currently
available transcriptomic data for S. aurata and identify
OXPHOS genes affected by the nutritional status in this
species. 454 sequencing of liver and white skeletal
muscle cDNA normalised libraries from S. aurata juve-
niles submitted to starvation or feeding on five selected
diets allowed us to generate transcriptomes for liver,
skeletal muscle and a hybrid transcriptome integrating
data from both tissues. The number of isotigs (19,530),
contigs (23,956) and average isotig and contig length
(1330 bp and 901 bp, respectively) of the hybrid tran-
scriptome indicates that effective data assemblies were
carried out compared to values reported for other fish
species of interest in aquaculture [44]. In contrast to
previous studies, prior to 454 pyrosequencing we con-
structed normalised libraries using tissue samples from
long-term starved fish and fish fed five diets differing in
macronutrient composition to allow maximal represen-
tation of transcripts abundance and diversity in regard
to dietary condition. Furthermore, the present study
reports the first liver transcriptome for S. aurata ob-
tained using NGS technology. In regard of the skeletal
muscle, assembly of five cDNA libraries from the fast
skeletal muscle of fed and short-term fasted fish submit-
ted to various rearing temperatures allowed Garcia de la
Serrana et al. [21] to identify 50,515 isotigs with an aver-
age length of 454 bp (11,545 isotigs with an average
length of 1208 bp in the present study), while Calduch-
Giner et al. [20] obtained 7808 contigs with an average
length of 968 bp for the same tissue (12,333 contigs with
an average length of 1056 bp in the present study). The
length of assembled sequences of the present study
allowed annotation of a significant part of unique se-
quences, improving transcriptome depth.
Functional annotation allowed us to analyse frequency

of GO terms in assembled transcriptomes and within
annotated sequences exclusively expressed in the liver or
the skeletal muscle. Concerning GO terms, liver, skeletal
muscle and hybrid transcriptomes exhibited an overall
similar functional profiling. However, after filtering com-
mon sequences present in the liver and skeletal muscle
transcriptomes, marked differences in GO term fre-
quency were found between both transcriptomes for

biological process and molecular function categories.
Consistent with the plasticity and complexity of the hep-
atic metabolism, the liver transcriptome presented a
higher number of GO terms describing biological pro-
cesses such as transport, carbohydrate metabolic
process, lipid metabolic process, defense response and
cellular amino acid metabolic process, and molecular
functions related to enzyme activity. During growth skel-
etal muscle develops an adaptive response that includes
tissue repair, cytoskeleton organization and remodeling
processes [45]. Consistent with a higher growth rate in
S. aurata juveniles than in adults [46], GO terms associ-
ated with biological processes involved in development
and morphogenesis, such as cell differentiation, embryo
development and actin cytoskeleton organisation, were
more abundant in the skeletal muscle transcriptome
from S. aurata juveniles.
BLAST similarity analysis of unique sequences in the

S. aurata hybrid transcriptome against NCBI non-
redundant database showed higher homology to genes
from ten fish species belonging to the Percomorphaceae
subdivision (68.3% of annotations), as it is the case for S.
aurata [47]. The low number of annotations matching
sequences from S. aurata highlights the limited genomic
information available for this species in the NCBI
database.

Nutritional regulation of OXPHOS in S. aurata
Transcriptomic data obtained in the present study was
further used to identify biomarker genes of interest for
nutritional studies by analysing the effect of nutritional
status and diet composition on the expression of genes
involved in OXPHOS and ATP translocation across the
mitochondrial inner membrane in S. aurata. Given that
starvation periods can induce compensatory growth in
commercial fish farming [48], we studied the effect of
long-term starvation on the expression of OXPHOS
genes in S. aurata. Microarray analysis and validation of
microarray data by qPCR pointed to a marked increase
in the mRNA levels of a high proportion of OXPHOS
genes as a result of long-term starvation in the liver of S.
aurata. In the skeletal muscle, starvation upregulated
the majority of OXPHOS genes displaying changes in
expression >2-fold change, although at a considerably
smaller magnitude than in the liver. In contrast to the
liver, food deprivation downregulated also a significant
amount of OXPHOS genes in the skeletal muscle of S.
aurata. Thus, our findings indicate that the OXPHOS
process in the liver is more sensitive to long-term starva-
tion. In support of this hypothesis, mitochondrial-related
changes in fasted mice are also greater in the liver than
in the skeletal muscle [49]. Indeed, it was reported that
fasting does not affect the expression of OXPHOS genes
in the skeletal muscle of humans [50].

Bearing in mind that cytochrome c oxidase is consid-
ered to be the rate-limiting reaction of the electron
transfer chain [23, 24], the fact that starvation markedly
increased the expression of multiple components of
cytochrome c oxidase is consistent with upregulation of
OXPHOS in the liver of food-deprived S. aurata (15 out
of 35 genes significantly upregulated with an adjusted P
value <0.05; 6 of them with a fold change >2). Our find-
ings are in agreement with previous evidences highlight-
ing increased OXPHOS activity as an important
physiological adaptation in the liver during starvation.
Similarly as in S. aurata, starvation increases cyto-
chrome c oxidase activity and the transcription of
OXPHOS genes in the liver of mice [26, 27], and en-
hances the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in human
fibroblasts [28]. Moreover, a microarray analysis con-
ducted on liver samples of mice indicated that 75% of
diet restriction results in a modest but significant in-
creased expression of an important number of OXPHOS
genes [51]. In contrast to our findings, a recent report
addressing the effect of 10 days of starvation on the ex-
pression of 88 genes of the OXPHOS pathway in S. aur-
ata juveniles concluded that food-deprivation mostly
downregulated the expression of OXPHOS genes in the
liver, while starvation upregulated a number of OXPHOS
genes in the white skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, in
most cases with a fold change <2 [29]. The starvation
period (10 days versus 23 days in the present study) may
explain striking differences among studies. Indeed, long
periods of starvation are frequent during the life cycle of
many fish species as a result of migration, reproduction
and food availability [52]. Hence, metabolic adaptation to
food deprivation includes a gradual depletion of hepatic
glycogen levels in S. aurata, and starvation periods longer
than 18 days are required to decrease the liver glycogen
content to barely detectable levels [53, 54]. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the expression of OXPHOS genes in S.
aurata tissues could exhibit different patterns depending
on the starvation period. In agreement with this hypoth-
esis, three weeks of starvation were necessary to promote
a significant increase in the protein content of succinate
dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and F1F0-ATP syn-
thase in the skeletal muscle of fine flounder (Paralichthys
adspersus) [55]. Thus, stimulation of OXPHOS in the liver
of S. aurata by long-term starvation may result from a
metabolic adaptation that would involve increased lipoly-
sis, enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis,
and reduced glucose uptake and oxidation in peripheral
tissues. Consistently, starvation stimulates ATP-dependent
processes in the liver, such as gluconeogenesis and urea-
genesis, and β-oxidation of fatty acids to provide ketogenic
substrates [56]. Therefore, increased OXPHOS activity
may be essential to facilitate substrate oxidation and sup-
ply ATP in the liver of long-term starved S. aurata.

Among cytochrome c oxidase components signifi-
cantly upregulated in the liver of starved S. aurata,
COX6A2 and COX5B1 were more sensitive to food
deprivation. Both components may exert an important
role in cytochrome c oxidase activity during starvation.
In fact, the expression of COX5B, which enhances cyto-
chrome c oxidase activity [57], is repressed by high con-
centrations of glucose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [58].
The hypothesis that COX6A2 expression may be rele-
vant under food deprivation is supported by the fact that
COX6A2−/− mice are very sensitive to food deprivation
and loose more weight during starvation than wild type
mice [59]. Consistent with an increased expression of
cytochrome c oxidase, the mRNA levels of cytochrome c
(CYCS), a small one-electron carrier that shuttles elec-
trons from ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase to cyto-
chrome c oxidase, also increased markedly in the liver of
starved fish.
In addition to CYCS and cytochrome c oxidase compo-

nents, upregulation of two critical proteins in mitochon-
drial respiration such as COQ10 and SLC25A6 closely fits
with an increased OXPHOS function in the liver of
starved S. aurata. COQ10 is a member of the steroido-
genic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer
(START) domain superfamily that is located in the mito-
chondrial inner membrane, where binds ubiquinone in its
hydrophobic pocket [60]. Deletion of COQ10 gene causes
respiratory deficiency and the inability to oxidise NADH
and succinate in yeast, while overexpression of COQ10 re-
stores respiratory electron transport in the yeast COQ10
null mutant [42, 61–63]. These observations led to
hypothesise that COQ10 is essential for mitochondrial
respiration by facilitating ubiquinone biosynthesis and act-
ing as a chaperone for the transport of ubiquinone be-
tween electron transfer chain complexes [42, 60, 63].
SLC25A6 is an ADP/ATP translocase that is ubiquitously
expressed at levels that are proportional to the respiratory
activity of the tissue [64]. As a core component of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore, SLC25A6 can
strongly induce apoptosis in cultured human-derived cells
[65, 66]. ADP/ATP translocases are integral proteins that
supply cellular energy by coupling mitochondrial respir-
ation with ADP/ATP exchange across the mitochondrial
inner membrane. Presence of different ADP/ATP translo-
cases in eukaryotic organisms may enable control of ex-
pression levels in response to a variety of stimulus and
energy requirements, rather than displaying functional dif-
ferences [43]. Thus, since long-term starvation caused
modest effects on other ADP/ATP translocases (SLC25A4
and SLC25A5) in the liver of S. aurata, our findings sug-
gest that increased mRNA levels of SLC25A6 may be crit-
ical to support ATP-dependent processes in the liver
during starvation. The fact that starvation markedly up-
regulated COQ10, COX6A2 and SLC25A6 in the liver,

Silva-Marrero et al. BMC Genomics  (2017) 18:768 Page 13 of 16



while they were barely affected in the skeletal muscle, in-
dicates that the hepatic expression of COQ10, COX6A2
and SLC25A6 can therefore be used as sensitive markers
of the nutritional status in S. aurata.
In contrast with sensitivity of the expression of

OXPHOS genes in the liver of long-term starved S. aur-
ata, diet composition did not cause significant changes
in the expression pattern of OXPHOS genes. Neverthe-
less, the expression of OXPHOS genes in the skeletal
muscle was more affected by macronutrient dietary
composition. Compared to fish fed HLL, the supply of a
low-protein/high-carbohydrate diet (LLH) promoted a
trend to upregulate mRNA levels of most of the genes
whose expression significantly increased in the skeletal
muscle of starved fish, such as COX5B1. Given that
macronutrient composition of LLH is far from the diet-
ary composition of wild S. aurata and resulted in the
lowest SGR values among fed fish, our findings are con-
sistent with the fact that partial substitution of dietary
protein by carbohydrates reduces weight gain and results
in expression levels of appetite-regulating peptides close
to the values observed in starved S. aurata [67].

Conclusions
Four hundred fifty-four sequencing of liver and skeletal
muscle samples from long-term starved S. aurata juveniles
and fish fed diets differing in macronutrient composition
allowed us to obtain a deep-coverage transcriptome. Tran-
scriptomic data was further used to construct an oligo-
nucleotide microarray to analyse the effect of starvation
and diet composition on the expression of OXPHOS com-
ponents. Our findings support the notion that long-term
starvation enhances cytochrome c oxidase and OXPHOS
in the liver of S. aurata. Among differentially expressed
genes, COQ10, COX6A2 and SLC25A6 in the liver and
COX5B1 in the liver and the skeletal muscle were remark-
ably sensitive to changes in the nutritional status, and
