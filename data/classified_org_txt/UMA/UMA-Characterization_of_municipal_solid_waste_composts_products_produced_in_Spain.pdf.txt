1 INTRODUCTION 

Composting is clearly reported as one of the most effective technique to transform organic wastes into an interesting 

resource, useful to improve soil characteristics and playing a potential role in reducing greenhouse gases, due to its 

high content in stable organic matter (Favoino and Hogg, 2008). However, its agronomical properties are dependent 

on several factors, which pollutant contents becomes the most restrictive for its use.  

 Organic wastes produced in Spain correspond mainly to farming wastes, municipal solid waste organic 

fraction, sewage sludge and organic wastes from agrifood industry. Organic fraction of municipal solid waste is 

commonly managed in Spain by biological treatments, generally composting, to fulfil the requirements set by the 

EU Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) and, as a result, this compost becomes a possible product to be used in 

agriculture. 

 In Spain, municipal solid waste is regulated by Law 10/1998 on waste, which obliges municipalities of 

more than 5000 inhabitants to collect waste separately, but without special mention of organic fraction. On the other 

hand, Catalonia (NE Spain) has a specific regulation for waste since 1993 (Law 6/93 regulating waste) focusing on 

waste generation with special concern on separate source collection of organic fraction. This law has been recently 

modified (Law 9/2008), forcing all municipalities to collect waste separately, including those of less than 5000 

inhabitants. Thus, in Spain, it is possible to find (a) composting plants processing organic fraction from source 

sorted municipal solid waste (mainly in Catalonia), and (b) other facilities that treat organic fraction from municipal 

solid waste collected on mass, and recovered by mechanical separation at the beginning of the process. 

In order to avoid soil contamination by pollutants application from composted organic wastes, several 

Members States of the EU have adopted specific regulations to establish limitations for some of pollutant contents. 

Spain is one of these countries, and its legislation has been focused mainly on heavy metals. However, some other 

parameters are also important to be considered before an agronomic use of composted organic waste. Unfortunately, 

no requirements are set in the Spanish law to assess the quality of compost organic matter, and only a threshold 

value, requested as a minimum content, is stated for the total organic matter of the product. This Spanish law, RD 

824/2005 concerning fertilizers products, also provides requirements for the following parameters: moisture content, 

C/N ratio, percentage of impurities and particle size (Table 1). 

In this paper, the fulfilment of the requirements states by RD 824/2005 are evaluated for composts 

obtained from several municipal solid waste composting facilities of Spain.

 RD 824/2005 states three classes of compost (A, B and C) based on heavy metal content. Class A is the most demanding, but from 

the point of view of the compost commercialization, the legislation does not differentiate between compost from class A and B. Class C cannot be 

applied to agricultural soils in doses greater than 5 tonnes of dry matter per year. Composts that do not achieve one of these three classes cannot 

be commercialized and have to be landfilled (or incinerated).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS  

A total of 58 municipal solid waste composting facilities located in Spain were sampled in 2003-2007: 22 facilities 

of source sorted collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SC) and 36 facilities of mechanical-sorted 

organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MS). The compost obtained from these installations were analysed, 63 

composts from MS and 115 from SC. Composting facilities that treat SC add municipal yard trimmings, which 

improve aeration and provide a carbonaceous source that balance the initial composition (López et al., 2010a). In 

contrast plants that treat MS do not add yard trimmings because non compostable materials are considered as a 

bulking agent. 

The evaluated parameters were (a) moisture content, (b) impurities, (c) total organic matter, (d) C/N, (e) 

particle size and (f) heavy metals. Moisture content was measured drying samples at 105 ºC to a constant weight. 

Impurities were determined by removing them by hand from a total of over 600 g of dry sample. Total amount of 

impurities was weighed to calculate the percentage on dry basis. Total organic matter (TOM, % dry basis) and 

organic nitrogen (org-N, % dry basis) analyses were conducted on dry, impurities free and milled samples. Milling 

was performed using a planetary zirconium oxide ball mill (Retsch PM100) to avoid mineral contamination. TOM 

was determined by the loss on ignition after it was heated for 4 h in a muffle furnace (Carbolite CWF 11/13) at 560 

°C. Total organic carbon content was estimated by dividing TOM by 2 (Zucconi and de Bertoldi, 1987, Saña et al., 

1989) to calculate C/N ratio. Org-N was determined by specific ion electrode (ThermoOrion 720A as a 

potentiometer and ThermoOrion 95_12 as an electrode) after Kjeldahl digestion (Selecta Block Digest 20). Heavy 

metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb and Cd) after dissolution of 

ashes (ignition at 470ºC) in 3N HNO3 (Saña et al. 1989). 

For each parameter, differences between SC and MS samples were examined by t-test using 

Satterthwaite's approximation. 

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1 Moisture 

No significant differences were detected between moisture content of SC and MS (Table 2). Most of the compost 

samples did not comply with the legislation requirements regarding humidity, although they showed on average near 

the threshold (minimum content 30% and maximum content 40%). Considering together SC and MS samples, only 

26% were within the thresholds and 65% were below. As we reported in Huerta-Pujol et al. (2010), the actual 

composting process leads the compost matrix to low moisture content, due to self-heating of mass, but also to low 

watering developed. On the other hand, the post-processing equipment works better with low moisture content 

(Krauss et al., 1987) and preferably under 30% (Diaz et al., 2007). 

3.2 Impurities and particle size 

SC compost showed significant lower content in impurities than MS compost (3,83%±0,46 for SC and 9,18%±1,46 

for MS on dry basis). RD 824/2005 does not allow more than 3% of impurities with a size over 2mm (Table 1). This 

percentage is expressed in "mass" and therefore wet. Our impurities assessments were performed on dry matter 

according to the U.S. Composting Council (1997). Thus, in order to adjust our values to the proposed legislation, a 

correction of the moisture content of compost was done to express the impurities in wet basis and determine the 

degree of compliance towards this parameter. In this case 42 samples from MS compost and 67 samples from SC 

compost were analyzed. The results showed that 67% of the MS compost did not comply with the legislation, while 

64% of the SC did it, just the reverse ratio. However, and considering that SC composting facilities treat organic 

fraction from source sorted collection, 64% is still a low proportion of samples. This indicates that more efforts are 

needed to improve the quality of SC organic matter by improving source sorted collection. On the other hand, 

mechanical devices used by MS composting facilities cannot avoid the presence of impurities in the compost 

obtained (López et al. 2010b).  

The law also stipulates that 90% of the particles will pass through a mesh of 25 mm and no problem was 

detected to fulfil with this point. 

3.3 Organic matter and C/N ratio 

MS compost showed lower total organic matter and organic nitrogen contents than SC compost. On the other hand, 

SC compost presented a lower C/N ratio (Table 2).

RD 824/2005 sets a 35% on wet basis of total organic matter content as a minimum requirement, which 

represents at least 50% of organic matter on dry sample, assuming the minimum threshold of 30% humidity. Only 

few of studied compost presented values in organic matter under the 50% on dry basis. Actually, 21% of the SC 

compost and 46% of MS compost did not achieve this threshold. It is worth noting that very stable compost will 

result in a lower organic matter than those ones which has suffered an incomplete process. Moreover, as we reported 

in López et al. (2010b), MS composting starts from a matrix poorer in organic matter and, if the process were 

developed correctly, could easily low the 50% set as minimum requirement.  

Regarding C/N ratio, RD 824/2005 establishes that the compost have to present a value under 20. Most of 

the studied compost met this requirement (97% of SC and 86% of MS). 

3.4 Heavy metal content 

In general, MS compost showed higher values of heavy metal contents than SC (Table 2). Both types of composts 

were mainly included in class B (52% of the total samples), whereas only 19% remained within the class A. SC 

compost showed 30% of samples in class A, while none of MS samples were included in this class. SC compost 

showed 66% of samples in class B, 3% in class C and only 2% should be landfilled. On the other hand, MS 

composts mainly belonged to class C (32%), a few of them achieved class B (27%) and most of them (41%) should 

be landfilled (Figure 1). Therefore, SC composts showed less than 6% of samples with restrictions on use. 

It is important to know the status of fulfilment of the compost currently produced, but it is also interesting 

to see which heavy metals are more restrictive for legislative fulfilment in order to establish some kind of preventive 

measure. In Figure 2, we show the percentage of samples in each class for each metal. For both SC and MS, copper, 

lead and zinc were the more restrictive. The most significant difference between MS and SC is in the proportion in 

class C and landfilling destination (Figure 2).

4 CONCLUSIONS 

The results show that more efforts should be done to enhance and improve the source sorted collection of municipal 

solid waste organic fraction to increase compost quality. In general, quality of the composts obtained from the SC 

was higher than those ones obtained from MS, according to the classification established by RD 824/2005. Most of 

SC composts were included in class B (66%), 30% in class A and only 2% should be landfilled. In contrast, 41% of 

MS composts should be landfilled and none of them were included in class A. In both cases (SC and MS) zinc, 

copper and lead were the most restrictive heavy metals to fulfil the current Spanish legislation. 

It is important to highlight the low moisture content in both SC and MS composts. This fact could affect 

the fulfilment of the law and also could influence some aspects related to the compost application on land. 

Moreover, it could denote an improper development of composting process.
