Abstract 

Alchemilla vulgaris (AV) and Filipendula ulmaria (FU) are European medicinal plants possess bioactive compounds that exhibit 

many pharmacological benefits in human. The present work aims to assess two plants ethanolic extract; AV and FU of their 

antioxidant activities as natural preservative in beef patties. All plant samples were analysed using total polyphenol content 

(TPC), their antioxidant activities using Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power 

(FRAP),  color and TBARS (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) analysis to measure their potential as synthetic preservative 

in muscle food. The antioxidant activity of FU and AV extracts measured with TEAC were 88.46 and 68.21 mmol of Trolox 

(TE)/g Dry Weight (DW) respectively. Whereas, FRAP assay were 44.6 and 40.12 mmol of TE/g DW for FU and AV extracts. 

The effect of lipid oxidation of beef patties were measured with adding 0.1% (w/w) of lyophilise FU and AV and Butylated 

hydroxytoluene (BHT) packed in modified atmosphere (MAP) (80% v/v O2 and 20% v/v CO2) for 14 days storages. FU and AV 

treated samples showed no significant different compared with BHT (p>0.05). Beef patties treated with 0.1% (w/w) FU showed 

minimum changes in red color and formation of metmyoglobin throughout storages (p<0.05). These results indicate that these 

edible plants extract are promising sources of natural antioxidants and can potentially be used as functional preservatives in meat 

products.

Introduction 

Over the last decades, the development of ready-to-serve foods products posed new challenges from modern 

consumer to satisfy and optimized the food cost, appearance and most importantly about the food safety and 

nutritional values. Moreover, customers recently have been gaining interest in formulation of foodstuff that are 

healthy and functional, least chemical additives and preferably with natural ingredient [1].Therefore, the food 

manufacturing industries nowadays are very keen to venture in the variety of healthy food products innovation as 

new market demand and stimulate purchasing. The use of synthetic antioxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisole 

(BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) in food formulation developed health 

concern by public due their possible toxicological effects that may contribute too many diseases [2]. 

 

Lipid oxidation occurs in meat product affects the sensory characteristics such as colour, flavour, odour and texture, 
also causes the loss of nutritional value and the generation of toxic reaction products such as malonaldehyde (MDA) 

[3]. Alternatively, partial substitution of meat preservatives using natural preservatives had been studied in past 

years [4 – 8]. Soltanizadeh et al. [9] demonstrated the use of 3% (w/w) of Aloe Vera improved most quality 

characteristic that satisfy consumer acceptability. Soya, rosemary, thyme, oregano, broccoli and Gentiana lutea are 

among healthy substitute in the meat patties role as natural preservatives [10 –14]. Hence, it conclude that the 

natural edible plants responsible to many antioxidant actions may linked to the various type of actives ingredients 

including polyphenol.  

 

Alchemilla vulgaris (AV) and Filipendula ulmaria (FU) are perennial herbs in the family Rosaceae, widely spread 

around Europe and Western Asia. They displayed excellent antioxidant activity and many pharmacological benefits 

in human [15]. AV is well known for their antioxidant activities probably due to the high phenolic contents (rutin, 

tannins, antocianidins, flavonoids, flavonol, phenolic acid and kempherol) [15 –18]. The plant extract exhibited 

different pharmacological roles, such as astringent, antidiarrheal, diuretic, depurative, intestinal antiseptic, 

bacteriostatic and bactericidal, tonic, anti-arthritic and cancer deterrent [19]. Moreover, FU showed relevant 

biological activity as astringent, antacid, anti-ulcer, anti-rheumatic, immunomodulatory and cytotoxic properties 

with various polyphenol compositions [15, 20, 21]. Many authors demonstrated the present of numbers of phenolic 

constituent including derivatives salicylates, flavonols and ellagitannins that contributed to the biological activities 

in the plant extract [22, 23]. Moreover, both these plants could act as antioxidants and antimicrobials in food, acting 

as natural additives that increased food shelf life as well as adding health benefits to potential consumers. 

 

However, the antioxidant activity of AV and FU leaves extract towards lipid oxidation has not been fully 

determined. Thus, our goals were (1) to quantify the phenolic compounds in AV and FU leaves extract (2) to 

evaluate the antioxidant activity of AV and FU leaves extract using in Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 

(TEAC) assays and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) (3) to demonstrate the ability of AV and FU leaves 

extract to inhibit lipid deterioration and their effect toward red color changes in meat patties. 

 

Materials and Methods 

Materials 

Commercial dried AV and FU was kindly supplied by Pàmies Hortícoles (Balaguer, Spain), a registered herbal 

company. All reagents and solvents used were of analytical grade and obtained from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) and 

Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, England). 

 

Extraction of plants extract 
Dried roots of AV and FU were finely ground using a standard kitchen food processor. Ground plants were 

extracted with 50:50 (v/v) ethanol: water in the ratio 1:10 (w/v). The extractions were performed at 60 ± 1°C for 24 

hours, in the dark with constant stirring. The plants extract solutions were recovered by filtration using Whatman 

Filter paper, 0.45 µm. Part of the supernatant were taken for subsequent use to determine the antioxidant activities. 

The volume of the remaining supernatant was measured and the excess of ethanol was removed under vacuum using

a rotary evaporator (Buchi Re111, Switzerland) and kept frozen at -80°C for 24 hours. All extracts were dried in a 

freeze dryer (Unicryo MC2L -60 b°C, Germany) under vacuum at -60 °C for 3 days to remove moisture.  

 

Determination of the total phenolic content  

The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenolic content (TPC) as reported by Santas et al. 

[23]. Mixtures of 7.7% sample, 4% Folin reagent and 30.8% of saturated sodium carbonate solution final 

concentrations were diluted with the sample with 1:25 (v/v). Finally, final mixture was diluted with Milli-Q water, 

shaken and incubated in the dark for 1 hour. Absorbance at 765 nm was measured using a microplate reader 

(Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) against water as a blank. Gallic acid was used to prepare a 

standard calibration, and the results were expressed as mg of Gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight (mg GAE/g DW). 

 

Determination of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay  
The antioxidant activities against ABTS

●+ 
radical of plants extract were measured by using a modified TEAC assay, 

as described by Azman et al. [14]. ABTS
•+

 radical cation (7 mM, final concentration) was dissolved before adding 

potassium sulphate (2.45 mM, final concentration) and allowing the mixture to stand in the dark up to 16 hours. 

Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS, 10 mM) with the ABTS
•+

 radical cation were incubated at room temperature for 30 

minutes before used. Then, the mixture of the ABTS
•+ 

radical cation was adjusted to an absorbance of 0.73 ± 0.2 

nm, using a microplate reader (Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The TEAC values for the 

different concentrations of each compound were interpolated from the Trolox calibration curve and expressed as 

milligrams of Trolox equivalent per gram of dry weight sample (mg TE/g DW sample). 

 

Determination of the ferric reducing antioxidant power 

The FRAP method was introduced by Benzie et al. [24] and implemented with some modifications. The FRAP 

solution was prepared in proportions of 10:1:1 of 300 mmol/L acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10 mmol/L, 2,4,6-tripyridyl-

s-triazine (TPTZ) in 40 mmol/L hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 20 mmol/L iron(III) chloride (FeCl3), respectively. 

FRAP solution was incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes before it was mixed with the adequate dilution of the extract. 

The absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a microplate reader. Results were compared with the Trolox 

calibration curve, and concentrations were expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalents per gram dried weight of 

sample (mmol of TE/g DW). 

 

Determination of antioxidant activity in food model: Preparation of beef patties  

The lean meat of male cows slaughtered in accordance with approved guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee 

was supplied by local market. The meat was collected 7 days after slaughter to allow it to mature and was kept at 

approximately -20 °C for further treatment. Fat and joint tissues from lean meat were trimmed off lean meat (2000 

g) and the meat was minced through 8 mm industrial plates. Then, the minced meat was divided into 4 batches 

(w/w) and were mixed with 1.5% of sodium chloride (NaCl) and either i) control (no addition), ii) 0.1% butylated 

hydroxytoluene (BHT), iii) 0.1% FU lyophilise, iv) 0.1% AV lyophilise. All batches were mixed vigorously for 2 

minutes to attain an even distribution of additives throughout the meat. Each sample was moulded into smaller 

portions (about 20 g each), stuffed and packed with polystyrene B5-37 (Aerpack) trays and placed in BB4L bags 

(Cryovac) of low gas permeability (8–12 cm
3
 m

-2
 over 24 hours). The air in the trays was flushed with 80:20 (v/v) 

oxygen: carbon dioxide (O2:CO2) by EAP20 mixture (Carburos Metalicos, Barcelona) using packaging. Samples 

were stored in the dark at 4 ± 2 
o
C for 2 weeks to analyse the oxidation for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 

(TBARS) method. Every measurement was carried out in triplicate each day. 

 

TBARS assay 

TBARS measurement was used to measure the extent of lipid oxidation over the storage period as described by 

Grau et al. [25]. The samples (1 g) were weighed in a tube and mixed with 3 g/L aqueous ethylenediamine-

tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in ratio 1:1 (w/v). Then, the sample was immediately mixed with 5 mL of thiobarbituric 

acid reagent using an Ultra-Turrax (IKA, Germany); 32000 rpm speed, for 2 min. All procedures were carried out in 

the dark and all samples were kept in ice. The mixture was incubated at 97 ± 1 
o
C in hot water for 10 minutes and 

shaken for 1 minute during the process to form a homogeneous mixture. The liquid sample was recovered by 

filtration (Whatman Filter paper, 0.45 µm) after the sample was cooled for 10 minutes. The absorbance value for 

each sample was measured at 531 nm using a spectrophotometer. The TBARS value was calculated from a

malonaldehyde (MDA) standard curve prepared with 1,1,3,3 tetraethoxypropane and analysed by linear regression. 

All results were reported in mg malonaldehyde per kg of sample (mg MDA /kg sample). 

 

Percentage of metmyoglobin  

The metmyoglobin method was based on the method developed by Xu et al. [26]. An amount 5 g beef patties were 

homogenized with 25mL of ice-cold 0.04 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 15 second using homogenizer (Ultra-

Turrax, IKA, Germany), which was set at speed setting 2 (18000 rpm). The homogenate was allowed to stand in 4 
o
C for 1 hourr and centrifuged at 4500 g for 20 minutes at 4 

o
C using a high-speed freezing centrifuge (GI-20G, 

Anke, Shanghai, China). The absorbance of the filtered supernatant was read at 572, 565, 545, and 525 nm with a 

spectrometer (Fluostar Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany). The percentage of metmyoglobin was determined using 

the formula; MetMb (%) = [-2.514(A572/A525) + 0.777(A565/A525) + 0.8(A545/A525) + 1.098] x 100 

 

Statistical analysis 

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using Minitab 16 software program (α=0.05). The results 

were presented as mean values (n ≥3). 

 

Results and Discussion 

Extraction yield, total polyphenols and antioxidant activity assays 

The European herbs were tested for their polyphenol content and antioxidant ability. Ethanol is used as extraction 

solvent because is recognized as a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) component that safely used in the food 

industry application [27]. Rababah et al. [28] reported temperature of 60 
o
C found to be the best for extracting 

phenolic compounds in most common herbs including oregano, thyme and terebinth. In addition, 70% (w/w) 

ethanol extract is used to extract the bioactive compound of AV and FU for acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase 

inhibitory assay for treatment of neurodegenerative disorder in human [15].  

 

Table 1 illustrated the extraction yield, phenolic compound and antioxidant activity of AV and FU in 50% (w/w) 

aqueous solvent extract. Generally, AV showed higher yield, phenol content and antioxidant activity than FU 

extract. The phenolic content value of the AV and FU extracts showed positive correlation to the antioxidant 

activity value in TEAC and FRAP assays. The total phenolic content of AV and FU extracts allowed the estimation 

of all phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanin, non-flavonoids and many classes of polyphenol compounds present 

in the samples. The obtained results are in agreement with Neagu et al. [15] which found phenolic content of AV 

and FU are 112.33 μg/mL and 103.00 μg/mL using 70% ethanol solvent. The authors also identified amount of 

proanotcyanidins and flavonoes in the plants extract. Previous research finding correlates the total phenolic content 

with antioxidant activity which may contributes many pharmacological actions in plants extract [23].

Nevertheless the in-vitro antioxidant activity of TEAC assay gave higher antioxidant activity values of compared to 

the FRAP assay in both plant extracts. The assay value indicated the extracts potency to scavenge the long-life 

radical cation ABTS•+ generated in the assay [29]. Research finding from Kiselova et al. [17] showed the 

antioxidant activity of AV extract in TEAC assay that has strong correlation with the polyphenol content (r

 = 0.92). 

Moreover, Barros et al. [20] observed FU extract using acetone showed highest value in TEAC assay compare with

methanol and water. Meanwhile, FRAP assay showed the antioxidant ability of polysaccharides in the plant extracts 

react with a colorless Fe(III) to generate a colored Fe(II)–tripyridyltriazine form which can measured at 593 nm 

absorbance. A number of in-vitro antioxidant studies has been carried out including TEAC, Oxygen Radical 

Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging shown antioxidant 

activity potential in the AV and FU extracts [15, 30, 31]. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first 

report of antioxidant activity extract from AV and FU assessed using FRAP method.  Sufficient amount of studies 

have reported the antioxidant activities of AV and FU due to the various polyphenol compositions such as rutin 

quercetin, synaptic acid and chlorogenic acid. These compounds exert radical scavenging behavior towards free 

radical mainly reactive radical species (ROS) that could be explain in the FRAP and TEAC value during this study.   

 

Antioxidant activity in food model 

Many strategies on laboratory scale have been developed to improve the stability of shelf life in food models 

including adding amount of natural extracts that have similar effect as synthetic preservative. The effect of AV and 

FU on inhibiting lipid oxidation in muscle food has not been described. The oxidation in meat patties was measured 

in second stage of oxidation, secondary oxidation products (TBARS). In addition the change in color and % 

metmyoglobin were measured as physically resemble the freshness of the meat. 

 

TBARS analysis in beef patties 

The study carried out using modified atmosphere packaging for beef patties that was similar to the real packaging in 

the market. Hence, higher oxygen concentrations in MAP mixtures of 60 – 80% O2 and 20 – 40% CO2 are 

commonly used in beef product packaging for retail display in the market. Figure 1 shows lipid oxidation in 

different burger samples during the 2 weeks of storage. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as an 

indicator of secondary phase of lipid oxidation occurs in the sample are measured based on mg of malondialdehyde 

per kg of the sample. The secondary lipid oxidation is responsible for the alteration of flavor, rancid odor and the 

undesirable taste in foods [42]. The initial amount of malonaldehyde on day 0 to day 3 varied in the range of 0.1 – 

0.2 mg/kg of the sample and no significant differences were observed among the burger samples. Starting day 3 

onwards control sample showed the highest TBARS value among samples treated antioxidant (p >0.05).  During the 

14 days of storage, lipid oxidation proceeded in the control sample and reached 3.90 mg malonaldehyde/kg sample.

concentrations (0.1% w/w) of AV and FU extract and BHT extract in MAP atmosphere during 14 days 

storages at 4 ± 1
 
°C without light. Each sample was measured in triplicate and the average standard 

deviation for each sample was less than 5%.

In general, the levels of lipid oxidation in beef patties increased over time and followed the order: 0.5% FU < 0.5% 

AV < 0.5% BHT < Control. The presence of control atmosphere with high oxygen packaging (MAP) resulted in 

higher TBARS and increased the oxidation rate in muscle food [29, 32, 33]. No statistical difference was observed 

between sample treated with antioxidant throughout the 14 days storages, however the TBARS value of both 

samples showed significant difference compared to control samples(p<0.05). From Figure 1, the antioxidant 

potential of AV and FU extract at different storages days showed that the plants have activity equivalent to synthetic 

antioxidant, BHT (p>0.05). 0.1% BHT was added as comparison with natural antioxidant beside the FDA 

guidelines for using BHT is ≥ 200 ppm in meat product [29].  

 

The effect of AV and FU extract on the lipid oxidation in meat has never been reported before. The active properties 

of AV and FU attributed to various phenolic acid including flavonols, flavonoids-glucosides, isoflavones, 

ellagitannins and sinapic acid which prevent propagation of lipid oxidation [15]. The antioxidant activity of 

phenolic compound is closely related to the hydroxyl group linked to the aromatic ring which is capable donating 

hydrogen atoms with electrons and neutralizing free radicals. This mechanism blocks further degradation of active 

oxidizing from such as MDA, which can be measured by TBARS method [34]. The study confirmed the potential of 

AV and FU extract to inhibit the lipid degradation in beef patties. 

 

Colour and % Metmyoglobin 
Figure 2 illustrated the color changes in meat patties were significantly affected by two plant extracts and BHT. The 

change of meat color is an important factor that impacts visual attraction in consumers. Normally, the colour 

analysis parameters collected using Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400 represent the lightness (L*), redness (a*), 

yellowness (b*) of the meat surface. However, only a* value are shown in this study due to red color is important 

color parameter in evaluating meat oxidation. The decrease in redness color makes meat product unacceptable to 

consumer [35]. In all samples, the a*value decreased as storage time progressed and the red color of control faded 

very rapidly. The natural color of the plant extract influenced the a*value of the meat at the first 3 days showed 

significant different from BHT and control (p <0.05). At the end of storages, the redness value of control sample 

was significantly lower than the antioxidant treated sample. 0.1% BHT displayed highest value of a* until 5 days 

storages and declined gradually onwards (p <0.05). This finding was expected as BHT role as synthetic antioxidant 

which used to retain colour and delaying lipid oxidation in the meat. Sample treated with 0.1% AV exhibited the 

redness color at the highest value after 14 days storages (p <0.05), whereas FU sample showed no significant 

different of a* value with BHT sample. Therefore, the AV and FU at 0.1% (w/w) extracts as natural preservatives 

potentially preserved the redness color of the meat and displayed the potentially useful in prolonging the shelf life of 

the meat product.  

 

Meanwhile Figure 3 presents the effect of natural plants extract and BHT on relative metmyoglobin percentage in 

beef patties. A significant correlation between metmyoglobin (MetMb) percentage and the redness color features 

were analysed previously [29, 36]. The MetMb percentage increased as the storage time increased throughout the 14 

days refrigeration, whereas the control showed the highest MetMb value compared to all samples. Initial mean 

MetMb percentage was 23.9 ± 0.17 on 0 day and gradually increase until 7 days with no significant different for all 

samples (p >0.05). After 7 days onwards MetMb percentage increased progressively and sample treated with AV 

exhibited the lowest value significantly at 14 days storages (p <0.05). FU and BHT samples showed no significant 

different throughout the storage period, whereas the AV sample showed even superior to such synthetic antioxidant 

as BHT. According to Kim et al. [33], the MetMb percentage should not exceed 40%, especially when considering 

consumer acceptance and AV meat sample was satisfied this limit until day 7.

A number of studies examined the effect of different antioxidant on the meat color and demonstrated the lipid 

oxidation decrease the redness color of the meat [8, 14, 37]. Xu et al. [26] have proposed that the chemical reaction 

influences discoloration act as a catalyst of lipid oxidation. Free radicals produced by lipid oxidation in meat are 

susceptible to initiating the reaction of oxidizing oxymyoglobin (red colour, measured by a*value in Figure 2) to 

metmyoglobin (brown colour, analysed by relatively formation of metmyoglobin in Figure 3) which results in the 

discolouration of meat. Hence, the overall changes of % metmyoglobin were inversely proportional to the value of 

redness (a*). The scavenging ability of samples treated with antioxidant can reduce the oxidation of metmyoglobin 

acting as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals produced from oxidation of oxymyoglobin. The 0.1% of FU extract 

displayed the lowest metmyoglobin percentage and capable to preserve redness color specifically compared to

synthetic antioxidant, BHT. However, color deterioration and lipid oxidation very dependent on the test system, 

including the influenced of salt, sample preparation, temperature, oxygen composition, storage time and packaging 

condition. Thus, modified atmosphere (MAP) at control gas composition of the meat packaging is important to 

reduce the variable that affect the meat shelf life. 

 

The present study investigates the antioxidant activity potential of two medicinal plants –AV and FU – as inhibitor 

of lipid oxidation in muscle foods, which there is no data in the literature with this regard. The most bio active 

composition of the plants are the same may due to the same family of Rosaceae, however, the activity values tested 

are different. Numerous researches founds high content of polyphenol compounds in both FU and AV ethanolic 

extract, could be explained as antioxidant activity role in preventing lipid deterioration similar as BHT [15,38,39]. 

The plants contain polyphenol compounds that showed close behavior of antioxidant activity relevant in the study, 

which are rutin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid and synaptic acid. Rutin and quercetin are responsible exhibit 

significant pharmacological actives including anti-oxidation, whereas quercetin exert radical scavenging behavior 

that benefits in many neurodegenerative diseases by mitigating cellular damage induces by radical oxygen species 

(ROS)[40]. While, Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenolic components associate to free radical scavenging and 

antioxidant activities towards hydrogen peroxide and amyloid beta [41]. The present of synapic acid present has 

also radical scavenging properties beside the behavior or anti-apotopic and anti-inflammatory [42].  

 

Conclusion 

The aqueous extract of FU and AV plants exhibited different levels of phenolic content and antioxidant activity 

measured by TEAC and FRAP assays. Therefore, the antioxidant activity of FU and AV extract in the Trolox 

Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) were 88.46 and 68.21 mmol of TE/g DW respectively while the ferric 

reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant activity for FU and AV extracts were 44.6 and 40.12 mmol of TE/g 

DW respectively.  This study revealed the first time of radical scavenging activity has been evaluated in FU and AV 

extract using FRAP method. Addition of 0.1% (w/w) lyophilise FU and AV as an antioxidant in beef patties 

inhibited lipid oxidation during 14 days of storage in MAP atmosphere at 4 ± 1
 
°C without light. 0.1% (w/w) FU 

and AV decreased the discoloration of meat after 14 days of storage (p <0.05) while FU showed no significant 

different of color changes in beef patties with BHT (synthetic antioxidant) sample. Thus, this study showed that the 

AV and FU as a potential antioxidant sources for natural preservatives in prolonging the shelf life of the food 

products.
