Introduction 
Air assisted sprayers (mist blowers) is the most common technology used for pesticide application 
in vineyards. An accurate calibration process is always requested to obtain a uniform distribution, 
avoiding problems such as drift and pesticide losses to the soil. During the calibration process one 
of the key aspects affecting the quality of the process is the air assistance characteristics (air flow 
and air speed). However, while different methodologies have been already established to 
determine the optimal amount of liquid/pesticide depending on canopy characteristics, very few 
data exist concerning the best relationship between air assistance and canopy. The purpose of this 
research was to evaluate the effect of air assistance on spray distribution/deposition in a 
traditional vineyard in Spain. 

Material and Methods 
A special device for air adjustment was designed and implemented in a multi row sprayer Ilemo 
Hardi Iris-2 (Ilemo-Hardi, S.A.U., Lleida, Spain). The system allowed to adjust the air characteristics 
(air flow rate) from 0 (no air) to its maximum level (4750 m3/h per side) using a manual adjustable 
valve (Fig. 1). Four air flow rates (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% ad 100%) were selected during the spray 
application of a constant volume rate of 260L/ha (4.4 km/h; 12ATR lilac nozzles, 7 bar, 3 m working 
width).

Spray deposition and coverage were evaluated using three different collectors: real wine leaves 
filter paper for deposition and water sensitive paper for coverage. Nine sampling zones (three 
heights and three depths) were selected in five replicates. For deposition, absolute values of 
deposition (l/cm2) were determined using a constant amount of tracer (E-102) in the spray tank 
and measuring the collector’s area (leaf area or filter paper surface), following the procedure 
previously established (Llorens et al., 2010). Water sensitive paper coverage was measured by 
image analysis using Image J software (Rasband, 2014). Deposition and coverage data were 
analyzed by one-way analyses of variance considering the air flow rates as a source of variation 
followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc test.

Results and discussion 
Results (Fig. 2) indicated a very good correlation between collectors (leaves and filter paper) as 
tools for evaluation of deposition. The same tendency was observed when water sensitive papers 
were used. Concerning the effect of air flow rate, it was observed that no statistical differences 
were detected between maximum air flow rate (100%) and 75% in deposition values in grape 
leaves. Using filter paper as collectors, there were no significant differences between 75% and 50% 
of maximum air flow rate. This tendency was also observed analysing the coverage values 
obtained in WSP.

among air flow rates. 

Conclusions 
It is clear that an accurate air flow rate adjustment represents an important benefit both in 
economic and environmental aspects, while spray distribution quality is not affected considering 
the direct influence of air flow rate and direction in risk of spray drift (Gil et al., 2014) and the 
important variation of tractor fuel consumption at different air flow rates.
