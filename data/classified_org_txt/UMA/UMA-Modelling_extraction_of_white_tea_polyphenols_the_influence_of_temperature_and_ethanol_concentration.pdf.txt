Abstract: The optimization of the extraction of natural antioxidants from white tea has 

fostered intensive research. This study has investigated the effects of ethanol-water mixtures, 

temperature and time on the extraction of polyphenols and antioxidant components from 

white tea. The response surface methodology was applied to identify the best extraction 

conditions. The best conditions to maximize the extraction of total polyphenols were: 

ethanol, 50%, for 47.5 min. Although the yield of polyphenols was optimal at 65 °C, the 

maximum antioxidant capacity was achieved with an extraction temperature of 90 °C. This 

study has identified the optimal conditions for the extraction of tea liquor with the best 

antioxidant properties. Epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin and

1. Introduction 

Natural antioxidants are increasingly appreciated by consumers due to both their inherent positive 

effects [1] and to the possibility of using them as a source of natural additives to replace synthetic  

ones [2–4]. Tea is a natural plant that is a rich source of natural antioxidants and provides a high free 

radical scavenger activity [5,6]. 

Tea, the infusion from Camellia sinensis (L), is one of the world’s most widely consumed  

beverages [7,8]. Its medicinal properties have been widely explored [9]. In addition, its health promoting 

properties have been known from the early periods of the Chinese civilization, going back almost  

5000 years [10]. 

Teas vary in properties depending on geographical origin, climatic conditions and processing 

methods [7], but in general, they can be classified into three types: unfermented (green and white teas), 

partially fermented (oolong tea) and completely fermented (black tea) [9,11]. White tea is the least 

processed tea. It is exclusively prepared from very young tea leaves and buds, which are harvested before 

being fully open and are processed by air drying [10]. This less extended processing confers to white tea 

its special and highly appreciated odour and flavour characteristics [12,13]. 

Some in vitro studies have reported and characterised the antioxidant activity of white tea [11,14,15]. 

Other studies have focused on its protective effects on live cells subject to induced oxidative  

stress [16–20]. Some of them have concluded that white tea extract is a neuroprotector, because it 

reduces the effect of hydrogen peroxide on cells [6]. This could be relevant to enhance the protection 

against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Recent studies [21] suggest that 

the protective action of white tea in oxidative stress in vitro is related to the maintenance of the normal 

redox status of cells when they are susceptible to damage by free radicals. 

The antioxidant capacity of white tea extracts, which can be measured in vitro by various assays, 

including oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), 

ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) or diphenylpicrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH), among  

others [22–24]. This activity is linked to the high content of flavan-3-ols, which are also known as 

catechins. The major catechins present in tea are: epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C), epigallocatechin 

gallate (EGCG), epicatechin (EC) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) [8,13,25]. 

These catechins have a high health benefits and industrial interest. They can be used in the 

pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries as a source of additives or as a source of antioxidants for 

functional foods [4,9]. As a result of these benefits, more effective extracts are a research focus 

of interest. 

The main goal of this contribution is to determine the optimal extraction conditions of the main 

antioxidant compounds from white tea. In this study, the response surface methodology (RSM) was used 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 686 

 

for the optimization of extraction variables (time, temperature and % of ethanol) to enhance the yield of 

polyphenols and antioxidant activity [15,26,27]. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Chemicals, Reagents and Equipment 

Methanol, ethanol, acetone, sodium carbonate, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, sodium tetraborate, sodium 

phosphate dibasic and sodium hydroxide were of analytical grade from Panreac (Barcelona,  

Spain). Gallic acid (GA), rutin, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox),  

2,4,6-tris (1-pyridyl)-5-triazine (TPTZ), phosphate buffered saline, ferric chloride, potassium persulfate, 

Tween 20, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), sodium 

dodecyl sulphate (SDS), (+)-catechin (C), (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC),  

(−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine were purchased from 

Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Gillingham, UK). Ultrapure water obtained from a Milli-Q system from 

Millipore (Milford, MA, USA) was used throughout. Spectrophotometric measurements were taken on 

a Perkin Elmer FTIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Paris, France). Fluorometric measurements were taken 

with a Florestar omega fluorimeter. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MECK) was carried out 

using the Packard 3DCE capillary electrophoresis system equipped with a diode-array detector from 

Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 

2.2. Tea Samples and Preparation 

White tea was purchased from Manantial de Salud (Herbocat SL, Barcelona, Spain) and was stored 

at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) in a desiccator. The samples were extracted by infusion. 

Infusions were filtered through Whatman paper filters n.2 (GE Healthcare, Amersham Place, UK). 

All white tea extracts were protected from light and stored at −20 °C until needed. 

2.3. Determination of Total Phenolic Content 

The total phenol (TP) content of each extract was determined in duplicate by the Folin-Ciocalteu 

method according to Almajano et al. [16]. The mixture was allowed to stand in the dark at room 

temperature for 1 h and was finally diluted to an appropriate final volume with distilled water. 

Absorbance was measured at 765 nm against a blank containing distilled water instead of extract. Values 

were determined from a calibration curve prepared with gallic acid standard (GAE) (2–14 mg·L−1 final 

concentration) and rutin (1.25–15 mg·L−1 final concentration). Results are expressed as mg of gallic acid 

equivalents g−1 of dry weight (mg GAE/g DW) or mg of rutin equivalents/g of dry weight (mg rutin 

equivalents/g DW), respectively. 

2.4. Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary Chromatography (MECK) 

MECK is a separation mode of capillary electrophoresis (CE), which can be applied in the separation 

of neutral and charged compounds. The principle of separation is based on the differential migration of 

the ionic micelles and the bulk running buffer under electrophoresis conditions and on the interaction 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 687 

 

between the analyte and the micelle. The micelle is prepared by adding a surfactant, generally sodium 

dodecyl sulphate (SDS), into the running buffer. MECK is suitable for separation and quantification of 

natural antioxidants, because it is rapid, gives an efficient separation, uses minimum amounts of sample 

and reagents and is low cost [17,25,27–29]. 

MECK was carried out with the diode-array detector set at 200 and 260 nm to detect catechins and 

gallic acid simultaneously. A fused-silica capillary, with extended light path, 50μm i.d., 34 cm total 

length and 25.5 cm effective length, was used for the separation. The separation voltage was kept at  

30 kV with an intensity of 35 μA. The temperature of the capillary was set to 21 °C and controlled with 

the help of a thermostat. The capillary was conditioned with NaOH (0.1 M, 10 min) followed by washing 

with an abundant flow of Milli-Q water and then of the buffer solution (155 min). Buffer (pH 7) was 

prepared daily with 5 mM sodium tetraborate, 60 mM sodium phosphate dibasic and 50 mM SDS. 

All standard solutions (C, EC, GC, EG, EGCG) and sample extracts were injected in triplicate.  

A calibration curve prepared with standards was used to quantify the components (mg/L). 

2.5. Determination of Antioxidant Activity 

2.5.1. Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) 

The method used was based on Re et al. [30]. 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) 

diammonium salt (ABTS, 7 mM) and potassium persulfate (2.45 mM, final concentration) were 

dissolved separately in water, and then, the mixture was made up to volume in a 10 mL volumetric flask. 

The mixed solution was transferred to an amber bottle, covered with aluminium foil and allowed to stand 

at room temperature (RT) for 12–16 h in the dark. The ABTS •+ solution was diluted with phosphate 

buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4, 1:100) and equilibrated at 30 °C, to an absorbance of 0.7 ± 0.02) at  

734 nm, read in a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (WaldBronn, Germany). An 

appropriate dilution of the extract was added to ABTS+ solution in the proportion of 1:100. PBS (pH 7.4) 

was used as the blank. After mixing, the absorbance at 734 nm was measured immediately and, then, 

every minute for 5 min. Duplicate determinations were made for triplicate extractions. The percentage 

inhibition was calculated from the absorbance values at 5 min. 

The relative change in sample absorbance was calculated according to the following equation:

The TEAC value was determined from a Trolox calibration curve (ranging from 1 to 10 μM final 

concentration). Results are expressed as μmol of Trolox/g of DW. 

2.5.2. Oxygen Radical Antioxidant Capacity (ORAC) 

The ORAC method [28,31] is widely used in food science and biology. A stock solution of fluorescein 

(FL) was prepared by dissolving 2 mg of FL in 100 mL of phosphate buffer (PBS) 75 mM and pH 7. 

The stock solution was stored under refrigeration in the dark. The working FL solution (78 nM) was 

prepared daily by adequate stock dilution in PBS. The 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) 



Antioxidants 2014, 3 688 

 

dihydrochloride (AAPH)radical solution (221 mM) was prepared daily by dilution in PBS. The standard 

used was Trolox solution. 

The ORAC values were calculated using a regression equation between the Trolox concentration and 

the net area of the fluorescence decay curve (area under curve, AUC). ORAC was expressed as μM 

Trolox equivalents (μM TE) and was calculated by applying the formula in Equation 2:

where: i, the number of cycles; f, florescence units; CT, time of each cycle in minutes; in this case, CT 

is 2 min. 

2.6. Statistical Analysis 

The results obtained were analysed statistically using Minitab 5.1 for Windows (Minitab Inc.,  

State Collage, PA, USA) and expressed as the means ± standard deviations. Any significant difference 

between solvents and samples was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, considering 

significant differences at p < 0.05. 

2.7. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) 

The data were modelled and analysed by RSM, which is a collection of mathematical and statistical 

techniques suitable for problems in which a response of interest is influenced by several variables. It 

uses quantitative data from appropriate experimental designs to model and optimize the combination of 

factors that yield a desired response near the optimum [26]. 

In order to determine the optimum conditions for the extraction of tea polyphenols and to evaluated 

their activity with TEAC and ORAC, assays were performed using low and high levels for the 

independent variables, EtOH (%), time (min) and temperature (°C), in accordance with a factorial 

experimental design. The results of the preliminary trials of a two-level, three-variable full factorial 

design were taken into account, which involved three replicated runs. A two-level, three-factor and 

central composite design was chosen for this experimental design using the Minitab package for 

Windows software (Minitab, State Collage, PA, USA). Coded levels for independent variables are 

presented in Table 1.

Coefficients of the full model were evaluated by regression analysis and tested for their significance. 

The non-significant coefficients (p > 0.05) were eliminated on the basis of p-values after examining the 

coefficients, and the models were finally refined. For the first-order model, we considered a 23 factorial 

design augmented by three centre points. For the second-order model, we augmented the design with six 

points (star design). From the values (displayed in Table 1) and assuming a second order polynomial 

model, at least 17 experiments must be carried out to solve the matrix and the error evaluation. The 

resulting factorial central composite design for the two-level and three-factor scheme with 17 treatments 

in total is described in Table 2. The response surface values are the concentrations of resulting tea 

polyphenols, which are shown in the results section. 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Selection of Extraction Solvents 

It is reported by other researchers [26,32,33] that ethanol and methanol were effective solvents for 

extracting phenolic compounds. For this study, only ethanol was used, since it is food-grade and also 

cheaper than methanol. 

3.2. Experimental Design 

The experimental design was carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature, solvent concentration 

and time on antioxidant extraction. The variables and ranges used are shown in Table 1. The p-value for 

each term analysed in each parameter is shown in Table 2. The initial model and the final reducted model 

are shown in Table 3. The final reducted model, with all statistically significant terms, has a higher 

predicted R2, which means that it is more reliable in estimating a response. 

TP, ORAC, TEAC and caffeine show high number interactions with statistical significant terms  

(p < 0.05), and a good adjustment was obtained. 

3.3. Total Polyphenol Content 

The extraction efficiency of different concentrations of aqueous ethanol, temperature and time for the 

extraction of total polyphenols from white tea leaves was investigated using a central composite design. 

The total phenolic content in the white tea extracts ranged from 20.93 to 178.70 mg as GAE/g tea; see 

Table 2. It was observed that the best yield occurred with 47.5 min of extraction at 65 °C, using 

48% ethanol. 

All of the linear coefficients and two quadratic coefficients (EtOH2 and t2) were significant. The final 

response model (using uncoded units) to predict the yield of tea polyphenols is shown in Equation 3:  
22 0156.00270.06350.07821.13871.21036.24 tEtOHTtEtOHTP   (3)

where TP is the response variable and EtOH, t and T are the values of the independent variables, namely 

the concentration of ethanol, extraction time and temperature, respectively.

The coefficient of determination in a multiple regression equation measures the strength of the 

relationship between the independent variables and the (dependent) response. The value of the 

determination coefficient for the equation for tea polyphenols is R2 = 0.873, which indicates that only 

13% of the total variation is not explained by the model. 

Focusing on the RSM (represented in Figure 1A), it can deduced that the TP dependency is quadratic, 

and the optimal results could be obtained by extracting with 45% ETOH for 57 min, at 90 °C. 

The results of this study are different from those of other authors; Venditti et al. [10] obtained 

significantly higher values in white tea after steeping in cold water (RT) for two hours. This study found 

that extraction of polyphenols was poor for water and aqueous ethanol at 40 °C. 

Acid pH is reported to improve polyphenol extraction [14,15,17,34]. Zimmerman [34] reported that 

at pH = 3, ECG extraction increased 20% and suggested that this may be due to two possible 

mechanisms. At a low pH, either the diffusion of flavonoids from the leaf into the aqueous phase 

increased or degradation of the leaf structure occurred, permitting better accessibility of the solvent to 

the leaf components. However, when lemon juice was used to reduce the pH, the antioxidant capacity of 

the lemon juice bioactive compounds was not considered [35,36].

3.4. Polyphenol and Caffeine Composition 

Caffeine, EGC, EGCG, ECG, EC, catechin and gallic acid content were analysed by MECK. Catechin 

and gallic acid were not detected. All results obtained are shown in Table 2. 

Caffeine shows a final response model (Equation 4) with good adjustment (R2 = 0.89) in the model. 

Caffeine = 7.93192 + 0.41115EtOH + 0.21984T − 0.00481EtOH2 − 0.00166EtOH × T 
(

4) 

The caffeine extracted was in the range of 2.05–28.3 mg/g dry tea. The minimum values were 

observed in samples extracted with a high ethanol concentration. This is consistent with the low polarity 

of the caffeine molecule. There is no literature about the caffeine content of white tea samples. 

EC, ECG and EG have a reduce number of terms and interactions with statistical significant p-values 

(Table 3). They have an equation with low R2. This fact suggested that the TP model responds to the 

synergic effect of all catechins contained in the sample. 

Despite this bad adjustment, experimental results (Table 2) show that tea ECG content was in the 

range from 0.64 to 5.04 mg/g GAE. Lopez et al. [37], obtained similar ECG values (7.95 mg/g of tea) 

using an acid extraction method. Rusak et al. [13] reported a very high ECG content (42.3 mg/g of tea) 

after acid extraction and HPLC analysis. The latter author obtained 34.4 mg ECG/g dry tea using 40% 

ethanol for 30 min and 12.9 mg/g dry tea using 70% ethanol. 

The EGC yield was 1.21–29.60 mg/g dry tea. The maximum yield was obtained with ethanol between 

48% and 96% with an extraction time of 47.5 min and a temperature range of 56–90 °C.  

Rusak et al. [13] reported a range between 40.2 and 154 mg of EGC/g of dry white tea in bags and a 

range between 38.9 and 129 mg/g of EGC/g of dry tea in loose leaves analysed by HPLC.  

Lopez et al. [37] reported 11.1 mg EGC/g white tea, which is well within the range that was found by 

MECK analysis in this study. 

The ECG content of the extracts corresponded to values between 0.18 and 5.40 mg ECG as GAE/g 

tea. Values reported by Lopez et al. [37] (3.19 mg/g dry tea) extracted from acidified samples were 

within this range. However, Rusak et al.[13] reported that 36.6 mg ECG as GAE/g dry white tea was 

extracted using 40% ethanol for a 15–30 min extraction time. 

In EC analysis, a maximum extraction of 2.48 mg/g GAE was obtained in this study, which is similar 

to the value reported by Lopez et al. [37] (2.13 mg/g). 

3.5. Antioxidant Capacity 

The antioxidant activity of the different white tea infusions was assessed by the TEAC and ORAC 

assays. Some authors have shown significant differences in free radical scavenging activity according to 

the assay method used [23,38] and have reported that the TEAC assay is simpler and cheaper than the 

ORAC assay, but may give an underestimate of the antioxidant capacity. Tabart et al. [23] proposed that 

the mean of the values obtained using four different tests should be used. 

A comparison between the two methods used in this study is presented, and the results are analysed 

using RSM.

3.5.1. TEAC 

The contour plot (Figure 1B) shows that the TEAC values were highest for EtOH concentrations 

between 40% to 50%. The extract with the maximum TEAC value was obtained with 43.7% EtOH for 

90 min. Surface plots shows that there was a quadratic dependence on %EtOH and a linear dependence 

on extraction time. All of the linear coefficients were again significant, but just one quadratic coefficient 

(EtOH2) was included. The final response model (using uncoded units) to predict TEAC is shown in 

Equation 5: 

2384.0126.8314.2821.33540.325 EtOHTtEtOHTEAC   (5)

where TEAC is the response variable. The value of the determination coefficient for the equation is  

R2 = 0.91 (only about 9% of the total variation is not explained by the model), so it can be concluded 

that there is a very good correlation between TEAC and the independent variables. 

Samples 14 and 17, which had the highest TEAC values, had the highest TP values (Table 2). The 

polyphenols present were rich in EGCG, with moderate concentrations of ECG and EGC and a low 

concentration of EC (see Table 3). Salah et al. [39] reported that the relative antioxidant activity of the 

tea catechins assessed by the TEAC assay was in the order ECG > EGCG > EGC > EC, so it is clear that 

ECG and EGCG made important contributions to the antioxidant capacity. 

3.5.2. ORAC 

For assessment of antioxidant capacity by the ORAC assay, only two linear coefficients (EtOH  

and t) and one quadratic coefficient (EtOH2) were significant. The final response model (using uncoded 

units) to predict ORAC is defined in Equation 6: 
2415.0615.4017.38682.932 EtOHtEtOHORAC   (6)

where ORAC is the response variable. The value of the determination coefficient for the equation is  

R2 = 0.791, which indicates that less than 21% of the total variation was not explained by the model. 

3.6. Correlation between TP, TEAC and ORAC 

The study of the correlation between experimental data obtained in TP, TEAC and ORAC was also 

evaluated. Several authors have reported correlations between the results found for radical scavenging 

activity assessed by the TEAC and ORAC methods [39]. The results of this study show a correlation 

between TP, TEAC and ORAC values (Figure 2). The best correlation is that between total polyphenols 

(TP) and TEAC values (R2 = 0.90). 

The correlation between TP and the ORAC values is not so good (R2 = 0.86). The most likely reason 

for this is that the TEAC assay only measures single electron transfer (SET) and can only measure the 

extent of inhibition by antioxidants. ORAC combines the time and magnitude of the inhibition, so the 

effects of slow reacting and fast reacting antioxidants differ in this assay, but not in the TP or  

TEAC assays. 

All three variables in the extraction process had a significant effect on the polyphenols and TEAC 

value. EtOH and time had a much greater effect on the ORAC value, while temperature had less effect.

Figure 1 displays the surface plots of RSM, in which the fitted responses were plotted against changes 

in the factors, EtOH and time, whereas the temperature was held at three different levels (40 °C, 65 °C 

and 90 °C). EtOH and time are represented on the x-axis, while TP, TEAC and ORAC are shown on  

the y-axis.

The optimal conditions for the extraction of tea polyphenols predicted by the equation were:  

EtOH = 45%, t = 57 min and T = 90 °C. Likewise, the conditions for extracts with optimal TEAC values 

predicted by the equation were: EtOH = 40%, t = 90 min and T = 90 °C. Finally, the conditions for 

extracts with optimal ORAC values predicted by the equation were: EtOH = 40%–60% and t = 60 min, 

with no significant effect of temperature. 

4. Conclusions 

The highest amounts of polyphenols (both individually and as determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu 

assay) were extracted at intermediate values of the conditions studied (about 48% ethanol, 47.5 min and 

65 °C). The TP values correlated with antioxidant capacity determined by both the ORAC and TEAC 

assays, although the best temperature for the extraction of radical scavenging components assessed by 

the TEAC assay was 90 °C. Time is the factor that was less important, in the ranges studied, and %EtOH 

had the greatest influence. This study has identified optimal conditions for the extraction of tea liquor 

with the best antioxidant properties.
