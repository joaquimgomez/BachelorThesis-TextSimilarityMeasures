Summary

  Pesticide application in fruit crops in general, and in vineyard in particular, needs an 
important revision about the method to determine the application volume rate. Canopy 
characteristics and spatial distribution of plants on the soil must be aspects to be considered. 
Recent changes have been proposed to define the dose expression in trees and vineyard 
crops. Concepts as Tree Row Volume (TRV), Leaf Wall Area (LWA), and leaf surface or 
canopy height are alternative parameters for a more suitable calculation of spray volume, 
substituting the traditional method based on land surface. This paper present the results 
obtained using new technologies as ultrasonic sensors, lidar sensor or the new developed 
software for volume calculation “Dosaviña” based on the Optimal Coverage Method 
(OCM), in terms of volume savings and uniformity of distribution among the canopy.
  Different field tests were arranged between 2006 and 2010 in a wide range of scenarios 
in vineyard areas placed in USA (New York) and Spain (Lleida). Variables as crop stage, 
trellis system, vine variety, type of sprayer and volume rate were tested. In all cases 
conventional application procedure was compared with the proposed alternative methods 
based on a modified TRV concept (ultrasonic sensors), or the optimal coverage method 
(Dosaviña). General results indicate that saving on volume rate (and its equivalent 
pesticide saving) ranged from 32% in Cabernet Sauvignon using Dosaviña software to 
63% in early stages of Merlot using ultrasonic sensors. After those results and by a general 
analysis of the whole parameters, a general conclusion can be established: whatever the 
alternative method used in the calculation of volume rate based on canopy characteristics 
will lead in a improvement of benefits of the crop protection process.

Introduction

  Dose expression and spray volume rate are key questions for spray application in orchard 
and vineyard plantations. Attempts to improve the dose expression procedures have included 
recommendations based upon either two (leaf wall area) or three (tree row volume) dimensional 
factors related to the canopy structure (Walklate et al., 2011). However those efforts have led to a 
“chaotic” situation in which a comparison of label instructions for plant protection products (PPP) 
authorized in different European countries reveals remarkable differences in dose expression 
(Koch, 2007). This situation has resulted in a recent proposal by the European agrochemical 



326

manufacturing industry to harmonise, across Europe, the efficacy evaluation stage of pesticide 
registration (Wohlhauser, 2009).
  Other than the problem of the “dose expression unit”, which expresses the product quantity in 
relation to the treated area, the achievement of an adequate and optimal volume rate for an intended 
canopy must be established and determined separately (Koch, 2007). Dose adjustment, which 
reflects the adaptation of the product quantity to varying canopies, is directly linked to the criteria 
used to establish the total amount of liquid that is distributed into the canopy. This aspect has been 
widely discussed previously (Furness, 2003; Walklate et al., 2003). In all cases the main goal has 
been to adapt the total amount of Plant Protection Products (PPP) to the crop characteristics, but 
difficulties have been encountered in selecting the most suitable crop parameter. The high degree 
of variability in the crop canopy has increased the difficulty in obtaining general solutions which 
would be well adapted to all crops and situations.
  To solve the difficulties encountered in crop characterization and to accomplish the recent 
EU aim to reduce the total amount of PPP (European Parliament, 2009), environmentally-safe 
spraying techniques have been developed to spray only when and where needed with reduced 
losses to the environment (Doruchowski et al., 2009). Crop characteristics are directly related 
to the total amounts of spray deposit on leaves and values of leaf area and canopy dimensions 
(mainly height and width) can widely affect the efficiency values, as a relationship between the 
expected deposit and the actual one. It seems that any approach to adapt the spraying volume 
rate to crop characteristics will lead with a general principle that foliar application must results in 
similar deposits (μg cm-2), independently of crop size or canopy density. That system would avoid 
the problem of over dosage of PPP detected as a frequent problem in the early crop growth stages, 
especially in orchards and vineyards where in most cases pesticide dose rate is expressed in terms 
of land surface independently of canopy characteristics.
  In addition, other than the use of new technologies to characterise the canopy, different decision 
support systems (DSS) have been developed to improve the use of PPP (Kuflik et al., 2009), 
the establishment of an adapted volume rate according to the crop structure (Walklate & Cross, 
2010), or even for on-line applications to determine the total amount of PPP for any particular 
crop geometry (Furness, 2003; Siegfried et al., 2007; Cross & Walklate, 2008). Those systems, 
among others, are quite common in agriculture; they have been developed to help growers plan 
agronomical practices or apply PPP to their crops.
  The objectives of this research were: a) to analyse the ability of two different methods to calculate 
the optimal applied spray volume (Wine Row Volume and Optimal Coverage Method); b) to 
determine the adaptation of new technologies to implement those alternative methods; and c) to 
quantify the benefits in comparison with the traditional method to calculate the application rate 
based on land surface.

Methodology

  Two different methods (Fig. 1) to calculate the spray volume rate to be applied were tested. The 
first one is the Wine Row Volume and consists on an adaptation of the Tree Row Volume concept 
(Byers et al., 1971) for vineyard applications with a variable application rate procedure. A set of 
ultrasonic sensors placed on a conventional orchard sprayer for vineyard applications was used to 
measure “on the go” the canopy characteristics in order to adapt the nozzle flow rate according the 
crop volume variations. The second one has been defined as the Optimal Coverage Method (Gil & 
Escolà, 2009) and calculates the spray volume rate according to the value of leaf area. A wide data 
base including leaf area variation according growth stage, weather conditions, and operational 
parameters during the spray process and efficiency of different sprayers is used in the software to 
calculate the optimal volume rate according any particular circumstances.

Method (right).

The Wine Row Volume concept (WRV)
  The Wine Row Volume concept (Gil et al., 2007; Llorens et al., 2010) was developed from the 
TRV concept. This method consists on the determination of the applied volume (L ha-1) according 
to the canopy characteristics (m3 ha-1) and the intended application rate (L m-3). In this research the 
canopy volume to be sprayed by unit time (m3 min-1) was automatically estimated after the canopy 
measurements obtained with three ultra sonic sensors placed on a mounted air blast orchard 
sprayer Hardi LE-600 BK/2 (Llorens et al., 2010). Variability of canopy width along the row was 
recorded and further used in the automatically process of calculation of the variable flow rate to 
be delivered by every individual nozzle manifold in order to apply a constant amount of liquid “i” 
per canopy unit (L m-3). In this case the intended value was fixed at 0.095 L m-3 in accordance with 
results obtained in previous research (Byers et al., 1971; Gil, 2001). Fig. 2 shows the principle of 
functioning and the whole mathematical process can be explained according equation [1]:

Where qu is the variable nozzle flow rate (L min
-1), Cw the half crop width (m), Ch crop height (m), 

v is forward speed (km h-1), i the application coefficient per unit vegetation volume (L m-3) and n 
the number of nozzles per manifold (equal to 2).

The Optimal Coverage Method (OCM)
  This second method was proposed to determine the spray volume rate in vineyard plantations 
(Gil, 2003) and is based in the estimation of the value of leaf area. The concept includes in its 
calculation (Gil & Escolà, 2009) aspects related with canopy characteristics, working parameters 
during the application process, pesticide typology and weather conditions. The main concept of 
this method is the procedure applied to convert the optimal coverage value (droplet impacts cm-2) 
into volume per surface unit (L ha-1). For this purpose, the averaged value of theoretical VMD of 
applied droplets shall be included in the calculation according Equation [2]:

where VT is the intended application rate (L ha
-1), LAI is the estimated value of leaf area index (m2 

m-2), Di the calculated coverage value (impacts cm
-2), VMD is the volume median diameter of the 

generated droplets, and K the a-dimensional factor to correct the big effect of cubic exponent of 
VMD.
  During the period 2006−2010 both methods were tested in different field tests where aspects 
as growth stage, canopy characteristics, variety and type of sprayer were introduced. In order 
to have a wide range of scenarios, the field experiences were conducted in different vineyard 
in the Finger Lake region of New York (USA) and Castell del Remei in Lleida (Spain). Table 1 
indicates the total field tests carried out with those two methods and the main variables included. 
Spray application quality was evaluated by the determination of normalised spray deposit (dn), 
the amount of liquid deposited by leaf area unit (μg cm-2). For this purpose different metal chelates 
were used as a tracer at different concentrations (Gil et al., 2007; Llorens et al., 2011).

Results

  The obtained results were analysed in terms of its potential saving on pesticide and/or applied 
volume, deposition on leaves and distribution quality among the whole canopy.

Potential saving on pesticides
  Savings in general can be evaluated from two perspectives: a) in terms of the total active ingredient 
applied in an established period; or b) in terms of the reduction of the applied volume per surface 
unit, which is directly related to time, fuel consumption, and the applied dose. The average 
amount of savings in terms of applied spray volume using Dosaviña was 43.0% (Table 2). The 
recommended volume rate (L ha-1) using the proposed software was always lower than that applied 
in the traditional conditions. For the variable rate application method using ultrasonic sensors 
(WRV method), saving values were greater than 40% with the highest value for cv. Tempranillo 
(77%) in the last growth stage (BBCH-scale 85; Meier, 2001). In this particular situation some 
pruning before the test probably affected the measurements obtained by the sensors, increasing 
the distance to the crop and reducing substantially the applied volume (86 L ha-1) compared to 
previous applications, whereas the conventional application volume rate was increased according 
to the normal procedure in the area. In general, the average savings obtained were approximately 
58%, being in accordance with previous research (Koch & Weisser, 2000).

Spray deposition on leaf surface
  The spray application process can be evaluated through the analysis of the amount of pesticide 
(tracer) deposited on the leaves according the intended application rate, and also by the uniformity 
of distribution among the canopy. The proportion of spray retained (% Dl) was determined 
following the criteria established previously (Pergher & Gubiani, 1995; Cross et al., 2001; 
Llorens et al., 2010), and those values were related with the uniformity of distribution among 
the canopy measured by calculation of coefficient of variation of all the deposition values in the 
different sections of the tree per individual leaf or number of drops per leaf. Table 2 shows the 
obtained values of proportional recovery. Both methods presented similar averages close to 40%, 
without differences with conventional application. Fig. 3 shows the general tendency in a slow 
but homogeneous movement to the right of the graph, which means an increase in normalised on 
leaf spray recovery with better uniformity, obtained in all cases with the lower volume rates. The 
diameter of each individual circle represents the average normalised deposit (dn) on the leaves.
  An interesting relationship between savings on applied volume and canopy characteristics was 
observed when values of leaf area index and tree row volume were compared with saving values 
obtained using Dosaviña (LAI) and the proportional application prototype (TRV). Good relations 
were obtained (Fig. 4) in both methods. In the case of Dosaviña, the lower the value of LAI the 
higher is the saving, in accordance with the principle of functioning of the software. Fig. 4 (right) 
shows also the influence of TRV value on spray saving using the WRV concept. In this case the 
lower the TRV is the higher the benefits, demonstrating clearly the interest of any of the proposed 
methods especially in case of low canopy densities.

Discussion
  
  The success in pesticide application in vineyards depends directly on the selected method to 
determine to most suitable application rate, and for this purpose some measurements (direct or 
indirect) of the canopy characteristics are needed. Results obtained in this research indicate that 
the use of those proposed alternative methods (Wine Row Volume and Optimal Coverage Method) 
seems interesting procedures for that purpose.
  The two proposed methods to determine the application rate have lead into important savings in 
terms of applied volume and, as a consequence, in the total amount of plant protection products, 
maintaining or even increasing the quality of the spray process. Those results are right linked with 
the established guidelines on the recently published European Directive for a Sustainable use of 
Pesticides (EC/2009/128).
  However, those values could also be linked to those proposed by Ebert & Downer (2006) 
who stated that for agricultural applications, dose has little to do with efficacy because there is 
already sufficient pesticide to kill all the pests in the field many times over. And this conclusion 
demonstrated, once again, the high importance that all the calibration procedure represents, with 
great benefits when it is developed prior the application task.
