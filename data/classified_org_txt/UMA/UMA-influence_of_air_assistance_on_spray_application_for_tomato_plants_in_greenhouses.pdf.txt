Abstract

 11 

Protected horticulture production represents one of the most important agricultural businesses in 12 

Southern Europe. However, many problems related to the lack of mechanisation, intensive use of 13 

pesticides, and, in some cases, undesirable residues on food, have not been solved yet. In this 14 

context, application technology is a key factor for the improvement of the efficacy and efficiency 15 

of plant protection products. Spray guns and knapsack sprayers are the most common 16 

technologies that have been used for this purpose. However, several studies have demonstrated 17 

that, compared with spray guns, the use of vertical boom sprayers in greenhouses improves spray 18

distribution and reduces labour costs and operator exposure. The main objective of this study 19 

was to evaluate the influence of air-assistance on spray application in conventional tomato 20 

greenhouses. For this purpose three different spray conceptions were evaluated: 1) a modified 21 

commercial handheld trolley sprayer with two air assistance concepts; 2) a self-propelled 22 

sprayer; and 3) an autonomous self-propelled sprayer with remote control. All the sprayers 23 

considered were evaluated in terms of absolute and normalised canopy deposition, uniformity of 24 

distribution, and losses to the ground. In addition, the vertical liquid and air velocity distributions 25 

of the sprayers were assessed and compared with the canopy profiles and spray depositions. 26 

Yellow tartrazine (E-102 yellow) was used as a tracer for deposition evaluation. The results 27 

indicated that increasing the air velocity does not increase the efficiency of a spray application. 28 

In general, the modified handheld trolley sprayer showed the best results in terms of deposition 29 

and uniformity of distribution, especially at the lowest air assistance rate. These results were 30 

confirmed with evaluation of the uniformity of the air and liquid distribution.  31

1. Introduction 36 

One of the most hazardous factors affecting the economic, environmental and productivity 37 

parameters in protected horticultural production involves the use of plant protection products 38 

(PPP) for pest/disease control. Operator safety, residues on produced food, environmental 39 

contamination and economic investment are the problems related to this specifically as well as 40 



 3 

labour requirements, and most of them are directly linked to the technology used during the 41 

process (Nilsson and Balsari, 2012). At the same time, covered horticulture production 42 

represents one of the most important agricultural businesses in Southern Europe, focused mainly 43 

in Spain, Italy, and France (EFSA, 2010). However, many unsolved problems exist related to the 44 

lack of mechanisation, intensive use of PPPs (Nuyttens et al., 2004a; Céspedes et al., 2009), and 45 

undesirable residues on food (van Os et al., 2005). 46 

In recent years, there have been important improvements in spray technology, with considerable 47 

differences depending on the target crops. Manufacturers of field crop and orchard sprayers have 48 

progressively introduced new and improved devices, taking advantage of the latest developments 49 

in computers, electronics, and global positioning systems. Those improvements have led to a 50 

safer and more effective use of pesticides, reducing the risk of contamination, adapting the 51 

proper dose to the canopy structure (Gil et al., 2007, 2011; Siegfried et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 52 

2012) and improving traceability. However, the improvements have not been implemented as 53 

quickly in the case of spray application techniques used in greenhouses, where handheld sprayers 54 

or knapsack sprayers are still very popular (Nuyttens et al., 2004b; Balloni et al., 2008; Nilsson 55 

and Balsari, 2012; Sánchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). The use of such primary technologies leads 56 

to limited efficacy and efficiency of pesticide application, with high risk of operator exposure 57 

(Nuyttens et al., 2009).  58 

Alternative spraying techniques to handheld sprayers have been developed and tested in the past 59 

few years. Several studies have already demonstrated that the use of vertical boom sprayers in 60 

greenhouses improves spray distribution (Nuyttens et al., 2004a; Sánchez-Hermosilla et al., 61 

2012) and reduces labour costs and operator exposure (Nuyttens et al., 2004b, 2009) in 62 

comparison with spray guns. Other researchers have investigated automatic spraying on PPP 63 



 4 

using new technologies such as navigation systems and autonomous vehicles with ultrasonic 64 

sensors or machine vision (Mandow et al., 1996; Sammons et al., 2005; Subramanian et al., 65 

2005; González et al., 2009; Balsari et al., 2012; Sánchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). However, 66 

according to Sánchez-Hermosilla et al. (2012), the use of such vehicles is very limited because of 67 

the high costs involved. 68 

Air assistance has been considered one of the key elements for improving the efficiency of the 69 

spray application process in greenhouses, especially for dense crops (Llop et al., 2015). Derksen 70 

et al. (2007) achieved higher spray coverage on lower surfaces of bell pepper leaves using air-71 

assisted delivery with single-fan nozzles than when using conventional delivery with either twin-72 

fan or air induction nozzles. Similar results were obtained by Braekman et al. (2010) and 73 

Abdelbagi and Adams (1987). However, although air assistance has proven to be important for 74 

improving deposition on the canopy, it is still necessary to investigate the air distribution 75 

according to the canopy structure and the optimal relationship between the vertical distributions 76 

of the three factors affecting deposition, namely canopy surface, air velocity profile, and liquid 77 

distribution. Improvements in the uniformity of deposition have been achieved through optimum 78 

relationships between those parameters in several vertical crops such as vineyards (Pergher and 79 

Gubiani, 1995; Gil et al., 2013), citrus (Pai et al., 2009; Khot et al., 2012), and orchards (Landers 80 

et al., 2012).  81 

Along with the new and improved technologies, the working parameters selected for the spray 82 

application processes (mainly volume rate and pressure) are also important factors affecting the 83 

final success. A survey of greenhouse farmers in the Netherlands (Goossens et al., 2004) showed 84 

that 90% of growers used high-pressure spray equipment (i.e. spray guns or lances) to apply 85 

PPPs, even though spray boom equipment has become increasingly popular. Braekman et al. 86 



 5 

(2009) confirmed that growers were convinced that high application rates and spray pressures are 87 

indispensable for obtaining satisfactory coverage and sufficient penetration. Moreover, van 88 

Zuydam and van de Zande (1996) reported that the condition of the average spraying equipment 89 

used in daily practice is variable and usually not of a high standard. 90 

The main objective of this research was to investigate the effect of air-assistance on different 91 

spray application techniques, ranging from manually pulled trolley sprayers to autonomous 92 

sprayers, on the spray deposition on tomato plants grown in greenhouses. Additionally, the effect 93 

of air velocity and nozzle pattern on canopy deposition, uniformity, and losses to the soil were 94 

also assessed.  95

2. Materials and methods 97 

2.1. Spraying equipment 98 

Three air-assisted sprayers adapted to greenhouse conditions were tested (Fig. 1). These three 99 

sprayers were used for four independent treatments as the first sprayer, a research prototype 100 

derived from a commercial handheld trolley sprayer, was converted into two different versions 101 

equipped with different blower units. Consequently, four different treatments (T1 to T4) were 102 

tested. 103

2.1.1. Modified prototype of handheld trolley sprayer (used for treatments T1 and T2) 108 

The modified prototype T1 was a modification of a commercial handheld trolley sprayer 109 

(Carretillas Amate, Almería, Spain) with two vertical booms that could be adjusted to the canopy 110 

width and had six nozzles per side spaced at 0.35 m intervals. This modified sprayer (Fig. 1a) 111 

was fitted with an air-assistance device (average air velocity of 19.3 m s
-1

) composed of an air 112 

generator (Nuvola 5HP, Cifarelli S.P.A., Voghera, Italy) activated by a 3.68 kW engine, a central 113 

air collector, and six individual spouts fitted parallel to each nozzle.  114 

The modified prototype T2 (Fig. 1b) consisted of the same handheld sprayer as previously 115 

mentioned, but equipped with a different blower (B&D 3000W, Stanley Black & Decker Inc., 116 

New Britain, UK) with an air velocity of 14.0 m s
-1

 (average of values measured at each air 117 

outlet surface). This blower had an electric engine connected to a cable attached to the feeding 118 

pipe following the specifications described by Llop et al. (2015). 119 

Both sprayers (T1 and T2) were fed using a pipe connected to an external sprayer through a 120 

piston pump with a tank of 100 L capacity. 121 

2.1.2 Sagevi sprayer (used for treatment T3) 122 

A self-propelled sprayer Atom 120 (Sagevi, Vilassar de Dalt, Spain), with air assistance, 120 L 123 

tank capacity, and four nozzles per side mounted in pairs, was also tested (Fig. 1c). The first pair 124 

of nozzles was located 0.59 m from the ground, and the second one was on an adjustable mast 125 

with a height range of 1 – 2 m that could be varied using a hydraulic piston activated by the 126 

operator. The distance between the two pairs of nozzles was 0.7 m, and the nozzles were fitted 127 

inside individual air outlets. 128 

 129 



 7 

2.1.3 Self-propelled sprayer (used for treatment T4) 130 

A Unigreen self-propelled sprayer mounted on a platform with remote control, developed in 131 

collaboration with Unigreen (Maschio Gaspardo S.p.A., Campodarsego, Italy) and DISAFA 132 

(Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Forestali e Alimentari) (University of Turin, Italy), was also 133 

selected for the field trials. The prototype (Fig. 1d), described in detail in Balsari et al. (2012), 134 

has a 150 L capacity tank with two vertical booms and four nozzles on each side located at 0.45 135 

m intervals. The air-assistance device consisted of an electric axial fan blower connected to a 136 

vertical air sleeve with several outputs per side. 137 

2.2. Canopy characterisation 138 

The experiments were conducted at Viladecans (Barcelona, NE Spain) in a commercial tomato 139 

(Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Barbastro) greenhouse of 1265 m
2 

(composed of a main corridor 140 

with several aisles on each side) located in a typical field farming area of this region. 141 

The tomato plants had an average canopy height of 1.96 m and average width of 1.07 m. The 142 

plants were dispersed in a twin row system (two plants close together) with 2 m aisle width, 0.4 143 

m distance between plants in a row, and 0.8 m between twin plants. The canopy was 144 

characterised by measuring the whole leaf area of three pairs of randomly selected plants. The 145 

values of leaf area index (LAI) were determined by adapting the area/weight ratio protocol, as 146 

described in previous work (Cross et al., 2001; Gil et al., 2007; Llorens et al., 2010; Llop et al., 147 

2015). Geometric parameters (canopy height and canopy width) and derived parameters (leaf 148 

wall area (LWA), tree row volume (TRV), and leaf area density (LAD)) were also calculated.  149 

 2.3. Experimental setup 150 



 8 

The sprayers were evaluated in terms of absolute and normalised canopy deposition, uniformity 151 

of distribution over the whole canopy, and losses to the ground. In order to quantify the amount 152 

of tracer deposited on the canopy, four masts were mounted, two in between the twin plants and 153 

two outside (Fig. 2). Each mast was divided into three vertical areas (top, middle, and bottom) 154 

covering the total height of the canopy and resulting in 12 sampling zones for each replication. 155 

Filter paper pieces of 24 cm
2
 surface (3 x 8 cm) (Filtros Anoia S.A., Barcelona, Spain) were used 156 

as collectors and placed on dedicated paper clips previously fixed on the masts. The collectors 157 

were positioned horizontally. To evaluate the losses to the ground, four filter strip pieces were 158 

placed on wooden supports, two in the middle of the row (one per side) and two under the 159 

canopy. Due to the difficulty of completely randomising the sampling zones, nine replicates 160 

containing all the sampling protocol were settled along the same canopy row of 23.4 m, with a 161 

minimum distance of 2 m between replicates. Gil (2001), Llorens et al. (2010) and Llop et al. 162 

(2015) used similar arrangements. The sprayers passed along the row spraying the canopy from 163 

both sides. After every test, all the samples (filter papers) were carefully collected, placed in 164 

tagged plastic bags, and stored in a dark container. During the trials, the recorded values of 165 

temperature and humidity ranged from 25ºC to 30ºC and from 60% to 70%. 166

2.4. Adjustment of working parameters of sprayers 171 



 9 

The spray conditions selected for the three sprayers in the four tests are shown in Table 1. The 172 

sprayers were adjusted for an application rate of 800 L ha
-1

 following grower recommendations. 173 

It is worth noting that, with the self-propelled sprayer (Unigreen), problems relating to the 174 

efficiency of the electric batteries made it difficult to reach a pressure up to 1.5 bar during the 175 

trial and, consequently, it was not possible to reach the intended volume rate, resulting on an 176 

applied volume of 613 L ha
-1

.  177 

All the sprayers were fitted with the conventional flat fan nozzles XR11003 (Spraying Systems 178 

Co., TeeJet Technologies, Illinois, USA). The working pressure (in the range 1.5 – 3.0 ×10
2
 kPa) 179 

was established following the recommendations of the nozzle manufacturer, and the forward 180 

speed (3.5 km h
-1

) was selected and measured to be a comfortable speed for the operator. The 181 

forward speed was measured recording the time used to travel a known distance. Prior to each 182 

test, the flow rate of the nozzles was measured using a mechanical nozzle flow meter (A.A.M.S. 183 

NV, Meldegem, Belgium) and the pressure was measured with a tested manometer at the 184 

entrance of the section.  185 

The configuration of each sprayer (nozzle number, nozzle orientation, and boom height) was 186 

individually adjusted according to the canopy characteristics in order to match the whole canopy 187 

as much as possible, while avoiding losses to the soil or over the top of the canopy. In the case of 188 

the handheld modified sprayers (T1 and T2), the lowest nozzle, placed at 0.3 m from the ground, 189 

was closed to adjust the spray pattern to the canopy profile. In the case of the Sagevi sprayer 190 

(T3), the height of the top pair of nozzles was adjusted to 1.8 m. It was not possible to close the 191 

lowest pair of nozzles because of the characteristics of the particular sprayer. The nozzle setting 192 

on the Unigreen (T4) sprayer was also adjusted considering the canopy structure and the sprayer 193 



 10 

characteristics. The bottom nozzle was placed at 0.46 m from the ground, and the highest nozzle 194 

was at a height of 1.66 m from the ground.  195 

2.5. Characterisation of sprayers 196 

Before the spray tests, each sprayer was characterised in terms of air velocity and liquid spray 197 

pattern distribution. To evaluate the air velocity profile, a 3D ultrasonic anemometer (Gill 198 

instruments, Hampshire, United Kingdom) was used. The air speed was assessed perpendicular 199 

to the main air direction, simulating the canopy position in relation to the pass of the sprayer. 200 

Measurements for the modified sprayer (T1 and T2) were obtained at vertical intervals of 0.1 m 201 

at distances of 0.14 m, 0.2 m, 0.3 m and 0.4 m from the air outlet. This methodology is an 202 

adaptation of the method described by García-Ramos et al. (2012). In the case of the Sagevi and 203 

Unigreen sprayers, measurements were obtained at vertical intervals of 0.1 m at the distances of 204 

0.2 m, 0.3 m, and 0.4 m from the air outlet; the distance of 0.14 m was not possible because of 205 

the dimensions of the anemometer and the design of air outlet. For all the sprayers, three 206 

replicates were performed for each measurement position. Data from the anemometer were 207 

interpolated to obtain the air distribution map using the filled.contour function of the software R 208 

(Murrell, 2005). Additionally, the air velocity at each outlet surface was measured using a 209 

portable impeller anemometer (Lambrecht Meteodigit I 14163, Lambrecht meteo GmbH, 210 

Göttingen, Germany). 211 

The spray pattern liquid distribution was evaluated using a vertical patternator (A.A.M.S. NV, 212 

Meldegem, Belgium), which was placed at 0.3 m distance from the sprayer. The spray collectors 213 

on the vertical patternator were placed at vertical intervals of 0.2 m. Three repetitions were 214 

carried out for each sprayer. Results have been expressed as a percentage of total liquid 215 



 11 

recovered at each collector by height position following the models purposed by (Pergher et al., 216 

2002; Balsari et al., 2007; Gil et al., 2013).  217 

2.6. Analysis of samples 218 

Yellow Tartrazine (E-102 yellow) mixed in the tank was used as a tracer in all the trials. 219 

Tartrazine was selected for the easy sample methodology in the laboratory, the high recovery 220 

rate of the tracer and the reasonable low photodegradation (Pergher, 2001). In addition, this 221 

product has been used as a tracer by several researchers (Sánchez-Hermosilla et al., 2011; Balsari 222 

et al., 2012; Gil et al., 2014). For the extraction of the tracer, 20 mL of deionised water was 223 

added in the plastic bag, and after 1 min of mixing, a sample was extracted and measured with a 224 

colorimeter (Thermo Scientific Genesys 20, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) at a 225 

wavelength of 427 nm. At the beginning and end of each trial, a sample from the tank (Table 3) 226 

was obtained at the output of the nozzle in order to normalise the deposit. 227 

The amount of tracer deposited on the sample (canopy and soil) was calculated considering the 228 

water solution volume to extract the tracer and the area of the collector according Llorens et al. 229 

(2010) and Gil et al. (2007) as it shows equation 1:  230 

  231 

𝑑 =
𝑇𝑐𝑙 ×𝑤

𝑆𝑎
 

(1) 232 

where d is the tracer concentration per unit sample surface (µg cm
-2

), Tcl is the tracer 233 

concentration of the sample (mg L
-1

), w is the amount of water used to extract the tracer from the 234 

sample (mL) and Sa is the area exposed of the sample (cm
2
).  235 



 12 

Since the tracer application rates (Tcs) were not the same for all treatments, a normalised deposit, 236 

dn (g cm
−2

 sample/g cm
−2

 ground), was calculated according to Eq. (2) by dividing the deposit d by 237 

the amount of tracer applied per unit ground area, following similar previously described 238 

procedures (Cross et al., 2001; Gil et al., 2011; Siegfried et al., 2007; Viret et al., 2003). The 239 

normalised deposit enables comparisons between the different sprayers and it is represented by 240 

equation 2: 241 

𝑑𝑛 =
𝑑 × 105

𝑉 × 𝑇𝑐𝑠
 

(2) 242 

where dn is the normalised deposit (µg cm
-2

sample/ µg cm

ground),  d is the tracer concentration per 243 

unit sample surface (µg cm
-2

), V is the volume rate application (L ha
-1

) and Tcs is the tracer 244 

concentration of the tank for each treatment (mg L
-1

). Table 3 show the main values of absolute 245 

and normalized deposition of every test. 246 

2.7. Statistical analysis 247 

Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software R (R Development Core Team, 248 

2013). The effects of the different sprayers on canopy and soil deposition were examined using 249 

one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey HSD (honest significant 250 

difference) post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. Before statistical analysis, the assumptions of 251 

ANOVA were checked.  252 

 253 

3. Results and discussion 254 

3.1 Canopy characterisation  255 



 13 

The results of canopy characterisation are summarised in Table 2. High values of the calculated 256 

parameters (e.g. high crop density) indicated particular difficulties regarding pesticide 257 

application on this type of crop. In addition, from the ground to a height of 0.34 m, the tomato 258 

crop had no leaves.  259 

3.2. Air velocity distribution on vertical profile 260 

The results of air velocity measured at each outlet (Table 1) provide a general overview of the air 261 

performance. The highest value was obtained for the Sagevi sprayer (31.3 m s
-1

), and the lowest 262 

for the Unigreen sprayer (10.08 m s
-1

). The air velocities of the modified sprayers T1 and T2 263 

were 19.3 ms
-1

 and 14.0 ms
-1

, respectively.  264 

The detailed air velocity distribution obtained for each sprayer is shown in Fig. 3. In general, the 265 

modified sprayers (T1 and T2) produced similar air distributions, although the air velocities 266 

measured with the ultrasonic anemometer were lower for T2 (~3.5 m s
-1

) than for T1 (~5.5 m s
-1

) 267 

because of the difference in the air blower unit. In both cases, the plume of air was almost 268 

perpendicular to the vertical plane of the canopy, making it possible to identify the directions of 269 

individual jets, similar to the case in Dekeyser et al. (2013) for orchard sprayers. Moreover, the 270 

air velocity measurements at the top and bottom air jets were lower than those measured at the 271 

other four jets. This behaviour was similar for both sprayers (T1 and T2) but with different air 272 

velocity values. For the Sagevi sprayer (T3), three air areas could be clearly distinguished. At the 273 

bottom part of the sprayer, the highest values of air velocity were obtained (~6 m s
-1

), whereas at 274 

the central zone of the sprayer, the air velocity was almost zero. At the top of the sprayer, the air 275 

velocities generated were lower than those measured at the bottom and had a crosswise direction, 276 

whereas the bottom air direction was perpendicular to the canopy. The air distribution of the 277 

Unigreen sprayer (T4) was more homogeneous than the rest, but the velocity values were lower 278 



 14 

(always less than 3 m s
-1

). Differences observed in the zones were probably caused by the 279 

spraying system performance. 280

3.3. Spray liquid vertical distribution 285 

The spray liquid profile distributions of the four tested sprayers obtained from the vertical 286 

patternator are presented in Fig. 4. The modified sprayers (T1 and T2) generated similar profile 287 

distributions because they had the same nozzle distribution on the vertical boom. In this case, the 288 

aforementioned differences in air velocity did not affect the liquid distribution. However, these 289 

results are not in accordance with those obtained by Khot et al. (2012), which indicated that, at 290 

higher air velocities, more liquid was retained by the vertical patternator.  291 

[insert Fig. 4] 292

T4. Mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) are represented. Bars mean ±SEM of the data. 295 

 296 

The Sagevi sprayer (T3) showed a deficit of spray liquid between 0.7 m and 0.11 m and an 297 

excess at the heights near the ground. The liquid distribution of the Unigreen sprayer (T4) only 298 

reached 1.8 m, because the last spraying nozzle was mounted at 1.66 m, and was almost 299 

continuous in the vertical profile. Overall, considering the spray liquid distributed to the canopy 300 



 15 

profile (from 0.34–2.3 m), T1 and T2 were found to be best adapted mostly due to the height 301 

position of the top nozzle. Other studies (Derksen and Gray, 1995; Gil et al., 2013) have 302 

emphasised the importance of adjusting the vertical spray profile to the canopy characteristics in 303 

order to achieve adequate spray application. 304 

The high uniformity in vertical liquid distribution obtained for T1 and T2 can be linked to the 305 

number of nozzles placed on the boom and, consequently, to the shortest distance between them. 306 

This factor was also deduced by Llop et al. (2015).  307 

3.4. Canopy deposition 308 

A general overview of canopy deposition (Table 3) indicates that T2 provided the highest values 309 

of deposition and uniformity over the canopy. T4 presented the lowest canopy deposition but 310 

with no statistical difference compared with T3. These results are in accordance with those 311 

obtained by Dekeyser et al. (2013), who postulated that individual spouts result in higher 312 

deposits than axial sprayers.  313 

A detailed analysis of the canopy deposition showed that, in general and for all the sprayers 314 

tested, the average of the deposition values measured at the external sides of the plants was at 315 

least 2.5 times higher than the deposition at the internal sides. Moreover, the deposit at the top 316 

level was lower than those measured at the middle and bottom sample level, for all the tested 317 

sprayers (Fig. 5). The relation between the average deposition values at the internal and external 318 

sides was similar for all the treatments. These results (40%) are similar to those obtained by 319 

Sánchez-Hermosilla et al. (2012) (44%), even though the applied volume rate was doubled in 320 

this study.  321

sprayer – T4. Same letter (by treatments) means no significant differences (P < 0.05). Bars 325

 327 

The external depositions of the sprayers were found to be in the order: T2 > T1 ≥ T3 ≥ T4 with 328 

significant differences between T2 and the rest of the treatments (Table 4). In terms of internal 329 

deposition, no significant differences were detected between T1, T2, and T3 (mean of 0.10 μg 330 

cm
-2

), whereas T4 presented a significantly lower value (0.05 μg cm
-2

) respect T2.  331 

A detailed evaluation of the results obtained for T1 and T2 indicated that higher air velocity does 332 

not imply higher spray deposition, and the sprayer with highest air velocity (T3) showed less 333 

deposition than sprayer T2. Furthermore, T1 and T2 presented more deposition at the top canopy 334 

level because of the position of the top nozzle, as shown in Fig. 4, which demonstrates that the 335 

high positions of those sprayers lead to more liquid recovery.  336 

The importance of adjusting the vertical liquid distribution and air distribution according to the 337 

canopy structure has been widely demonstrated in previous studies (Derksen and Gray, 1995; 338 

Pergher et al., 1997). The results obtained in this research showed that T3 and T4, which 339 

delivered the most heterogeneous vertical liquid distribution and air distribution, also generated 340 

the greatest differences in canopy deposition between the sampling zones, especially in the 341 

external part of the canopy (Figs. 4 and 5). Treatments T1 and T2, which generated a more-342 

homogeneous vertical distribution (air velocity and liquid), provided the most-uniform spray 343 

deposition on the canopy according to the coefficient of variation (Table 3). The obtained results 344 

also demonstrated that higher air velocity does not imply better liquid distribution or higher spray 345 



 17 

deposition, penetration, and uniformity. In general, T1 and T2, which had low air velocities but 346 

the most-uniform distributions, demonstrated the highest adaptabilities to the canopy. These 347 

results are in concordance with those obtained by Cross et al. (2003).  348 

3.5. Losses to the soil 349 

In terms of ground losses, measured as average deposition on the ground, there were no 350 

significant differences between the sprayers (Table 3). 351 

The distribution of the losses to the soil was similar for all the treatments. The maximum 352 

deposition was measured on the samples placed under the crop (Fig. 6), whereas the losses 353 

detected in the middle aisle were less than 0.03 μg cm
-2

, except for T3 for which the amount of 354 

deposition was significantly the highest (0.09 μg cm
-2

). This tendency can be explained by the 355 

high air velocity of this sprayer (Fig. 3)., which could push the spray across the canopy, thereby 356 

increasing the losses to the soil In general, the tracer deposits under the canopy were high, 357 

sometimes similar to the deposits at the canopy collectors. This may be because there was no 358 

vegetation close to the ground (from ground level to 0.5 m). In the case of T4, the losses under 359 

the canopy were considerably higher, mainly because of the position of the lowest nozzle (0.45 m 360 

above the ground), which probably directed the spray pattern to the ground. 361

From the results, it was identified that losses to the soil are important compared with the 368 

deposition on the canopy for this particular case of tomato greenhouses with narrow layouts. 369 

Independent of the sprayer, nozzle configuration, and air velocity, the deposits on the soil under 370 

the canopy represent an important source of contamination. This fact could be attributed to the 371 

high-applied volume rate with respect to the canopy characteristics and density (see Table 1). 372 

However, this value was chosen according to the most representative value for the zone.  373 

In conclusion, the results of the field tests conducted for the evaluation of different spray 374 

technologies in tomato greenhouses emphasise some important aspects:  375 

- On sprayers T1 and T2, there was no effect of the air velocity on vertical liquid 376 

distribution made with vertical patternator.  377 

- Even when air assistance was used, there was a great variability between external and 378 

internal deposition, considering the different canopy sections. The deposition at internal 379 

part of the canopy was at least 2.5 times lower than external side, highlighting the 380 

difficulty to penetrate at the internal side of the canopy.  381 

- The modified spray hand held trolley T2 show the highest values in terms of deposition 382 

with an air speed of 14 m s
-1

. However, increasing the air velocity did not increase the 383 

efficiency of the spray application. 384 

- Air velocity and vertical spray pattern significantly affected the pesticide distribution on 385 

the canopy. The determination these parameters was a useful tool to assess the spray 386 

distribution on the canopy. In general the ground losses were relatively high even in some 387 

cases can be higher than the canopy deposition revealing the high risk of ground 388 

contamination. As concluded by some other researchers (Balsari et al., 2008; Khot et al., 389 



 19 

2012), there is a need to establish an appropriate relationship between the air 390 

characteristics (air velocity) and the canopy, even for greenhouse crops. 391 

Considering the importance of greenhouse production in the area, there is a need to improve 392 

the pesticide application process, which is still hindered by a lack of advanced technologies, 393 

compared with other agricultural sectors. 394
