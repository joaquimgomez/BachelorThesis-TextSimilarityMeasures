Abstract 15 

Because of variations in environmental conditions, spray-drift field measurements following ISO 16 

22866:2005 involve complicated and time-consuming experiments often with low repeatability. 17 

Therefore, simple, repeatable, and precise alternative drift assessment methods that are 18 

complementary to the official standards are required. One of the alternatives is the use of a drift test 19 

bench for field crop sprayers. Previous studies have demonstrated that the drift test bench can be 20 

considered an adequate complement to existing standard protocols for field drift measurements. In 21 

this study, in order to further improve the methodology and to evaluate the possibility of classifying 22 

different field-crop-sprayer settings according to drift risk using a test bench, a series of tests were 23 

performed in a test hall. A conventional mounted Delvano HD3 crop sprayer (Delvano, Kuurne, 24 

Belgium) equipped with an 800-l spray tank and a 15-m-wide stainless steel spray boom was used. 25 

Eight different sprayer setups were tested, involving three nozzle types (TeeJet XR 110 04, Agrotop 26 

TDXL 110 04 and Micron Micromax 3) and three boom heights (0.30, 0.50, and 0.70 m). For the 27 

drift classification, the reference sprayer drift behaviour was defined as that obtained using 28 

conventional flat fan TeeJet XR 110 04 nozzles operated at 0.30 MPa and at a boom height of 29

and the results underlined the effects of nozzle type and boom height on the potential drift. The 31 

feasibility of the test-bench methodology for classifying field-crop-sprayer drift according to ISO 32 

22369-1:2006 was demonstrated. 33

1. Introduction 52 

The requirements of the European Directive 128/2009/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides 53 

include the objective to reduce spray drift during application of agrochemicals to crops, especially 54 



in the proximity of sensitive areas (e.g., water bodies, natural reserves, and urban areas). To achieve 55 

this goal, various spray-drift mitigation measures can be adopted, which either affect the sprayer 56 

components directly (e.g., the mounting of air-induction nozzles) or require sprayer adjustment. 57 

Alternatively, indirect mitigation measures such as the construction of buffer zones and physical 58 

barriers (e.g., hedges) along the borders of sprayed fields can be adopted. A combination of direct 59 

and indirect spray-drift mitigation measures may facilitate minimisation of the widths of the buffer 60 

zones established between the application areas and the sensitive zones, thereby increasing the land 61 

surface available for cultivation.  62 

In order to define buffer-zone widths, it is necessary to consider certain parameters, such as the 63 

features of the sensitive area in question (e.g., the size of a water course), the toxicity of the applied 64 

agrochemicals and, most importantly, the spray application parameters adopted for the 65 

agrochemical distribution (Gilbert, 2000; Nilsson and Svensson, 2004). As regards the latter, it is 66 

necessary to consider the sprayer type, nozzles, and operative parameters of the sprayer (Herbst and 67 

Ganzelmeier, 2000; van de Zande et al., 2000; Nuyttens et al., 2007). In 2006, criteria to classify 68 

spraying equipment according to drift risk were established (ISO 22369-1:2006). These criteria are 69 

based on a relative comparison between the drift generated by the candidate spraying equipment 70 

and a reference apparatus, which is selected as being representative of the most common spraying 71 

technique adopted for a certain scenario (e.g., for application to field crops, vineyards or orchards). 72 

To date, this relative comparison has been performed using drift measurement data that can be 73 

obtained in the field, applying the ISO 22866:2005 test methodology (ISO 22866:2005), or in a 74 

laboratory wind tunnel, following the ISO standard 22856:2008 (Nuyttens et al., 2011).  75 

Both standardised test methodologies, however, have certain limitations. ISO 22866:2005 76 

methodologies are designed for tests to measure the amount of drift outside the applied field for 77 

defined wind-speed and -direction conditions. However, it is difficult to perform relative 78 

comparisons between spraying results, as operation under the same wind conditions is required for a 79 

successful comparison. Moreover, the test procedure itself is complex and time consuming and, as 80 



regards spray application to arboreal crops, the results are affected by the morphological and 81 

vegetative features of the orchard/vineyard in which the tests are performed. On the other hand, the 82 

ISO 22856:2008 methodology facilitates the performance of relative comparisons more rapidly. 83 

However, this comparison is primarily between nozzles rather than the full spraying system, as the 84 

test procedure involves drift measurement in a wind tunnel with dimensions sufficient to contain 85 

small boom sprayers only. Therefore, using ISO 22856:2008, it is difficult to compare the spray 86 

drift generated by complete sprayers, since drift not only depends on the spray quality, but also on 87 

the sprayer configuration and adjustment. 88 

To overcome these limitations, researchers at the Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Forestali e 89 

Alimentari (DiSAFA) at the University of Torino (Turin, Italy), in collaboration with the Advanced 90 

Agricultural Measurement Systems (AAMS)-Salvarani company (Maldegerm, Belgium), 91 

researched and developed an ad hoc test bench for the measurement of potential spray drift (Balsari 92 

et al., 2007). Potential spray drift is defined as the percentage of initial spray volume that remains 93 

suspended in the air after the sprayer passage and which represents the fraction of spray liquid more 94 

susceptible to drift out of the treated area by the action of air currents during the application 95 

process. It differs from the absolute spray drift because it consists only of a plume of droplets which 96 

remain suspended in the air after the passage of the sprayer along the swath and these droplets 97 

deposit sometime after the boom has moved over a given point. As potential drift has to be 98 

measured in the absence of wind, its amount is not affected by wind velocity and direction, but it 99 

depends only on the turbulence generated by the sprayer moving forward  and is influenced by 100 

boom height and size of the sprayed droplets. On the other hand absolute spray drift, according to 101 

the definition given in ISO 22866 (2005) is represented by the “quantity of plant protection product 102 

that is carried out of the sprayed (treated) area by the action of air currents 103 

during the application process”. Its amount is therefore represented by all the spray that is applied 104 

within the field but is blown out of target area by wind. Wind velocity and direction therefore 105 

strongly affect absolute drift values, making it difficult to determine the influence of individual 106 



sprayer parameters on the results obtained, particularly if the wind conditions vary.  This is the 107 

reason why, in order to make relative comparisons between spraying equipment in terms of drift 108 

risk, measurement of potential drift was considered here to be a more suitable parameter for 109 

providing objective and reproducible data since the influence of environmental conditions on the 110 

results obtained is much less.  111 

Researchers have promoted the establishment of an ISO standardised test methodology (ISO 112 

22401:2015) for measuring the potential spray drift generated by field crop sprayers. During the 113 

process of establishing the test method, the members of ISO TC23/SC6/WG 16 performed indoor 114 

tests on field crop sprayers at the Praktijkcentrum voor Land- en Tuinbouw (PCLT) testing hall in 115 

Roeselare (Belgium), which were primarily intended to assess the robustness of the proposed 116 

methodology. During these tests, among other investigations, an evaluation of the potential spray 117 

drift generated by different combinations of boom heights and nozzle types on a Delvano HD3 118 

mounted field crop sprayer was conducted, using the test bench.  119 

This paper reports on these tests and their findings, thereby clarifying the influence of boom height 120 

and nozzle type on potential spray drift. Hence, the efficacy of the ISO 22401:2015 methodology 121 

for classifying different field-crop-sprayer settings according to drift risk is evaluated, and discusses 122 

the reproducibility of the test-bench-based results and its functionality. 123 

2. Materials and methods 124 

2.1 Measuring set 125 

Tests were conducted at PCLT Roeselare in Belgium, in a test hall of approximately 60 m in length, 126 

30 m in width, and 8 m in height, with a completely level earth floor (Fig. 1).  127 

[Insert Fig. 1] 128 

The environmental conditions (air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed and direction) 129 

were measured and registered during the tests using an Allemano Testo 400 thermo-hygrometer 130 

(Nuova Allemano, Collegno, Italy) and a Gill Windsonic sonic anemometer (Gill Instruments, 131 



Hampshire, UK) at 1-Hz frequency. Instruments were positioned on one side of the test hall at 2 m 132 

height from the ground. 133 

All the tests were conducted at an average air temperature of 10°C (minimum and maximum: 8.7°C 134 

and 11.3°C, respectively), an average relative humidity of 81% (minimum and maximum: 78% and 135 

84%, respectively) and a very low average wind speed of 0.07 m s
-1

 (minimum and maximum: 0.04 136 

and 0.14 m s
-1

, respectively). Thus, the environmental conditions for all of the performed tests were 137 

stable and uniform. The tests were performed in accordance with the ISO 22401:2015 methodology 138 

(ISO 22401:2015). The drift test bench consisted of an aluminium frame of 10.5-m length and 0.5-139 

m width, which contained slots for artificial collectors (plastic Petri dishes, 150-mm diameter; 140 

Kartell, Milano). These artificial collector slots were positioned at intervals of 0.5 m and equipped 141 

with sliding lids to ensure that the collectors could be completely covered. The test bench was 142 

positioned such that the line of collectors was parallel to the driving direction and aligned with the 143 

centre of the right-hand side of the spray boom (Fig. 1). Two slots at both extremities of the bench 144 

were left permanently uncovered so that the effective overall spray deposition under the boom could 145 

be measured. Deposit collectors were located at a height of approximately 0.25 m from the ground.  146 

During each run, the boom sprayer moved at a set forward speed along a path of approximately 50 147 

m in length, spraying over the covered test bench, which was positioned halfway along the spray 148 

track. When the boom made contact with the actuator rod, the slots were automatically uncovered 149 

by a pneumatic system. The actuator rod was always positioned 2.0 m behind the centre of the last 150 

collector on the test bench, independent of the nozzle type used, in order to prevent the nozzles 151 

from spraying directly onto the collectors.  152 

To allow all the droplets suspended in the air to be deposited, but prevent accidental contamination, 153 

the exposed Petri dishes were manually covered, but not until 60 s after the sprayer had passed. 154 

After collecting the Petri dishes, all sliding covers were cleaned to prevent dripping liquid 155 

contaminating the dishes. 156 

 157 



2.2 Spray application techniques 158 

The tests were executed using a conventional mounted Delvano HD3 field crop sprayer (Delvano, 159 

Kuurne, Belgium) equipped with an 800-l spray tank and a 15-m wide stainless spray boom with 160 

0.50 m nozzle spacing. The boom was mounted on a trapezoidal suspension, which ensured its 161 

stability and horizontality. The sprayer was coupled to a New Holland 8260 tractor with 75-kW 162 

power. All tests were performed at 6 km h
-1

 forward speed. 163 

Eight different spray application techniques were tested, with three repetitions for each setup (Table 164 

1). Three different nozzle types (a TeeJet XR 11004 conventional flat-fan at 0.30-MPa pressure, an 165 

Agrotop TDXL 11004 air-induction flat fan at 0.30 MPa, and Micron Micromax 3 rotary atomisers 166 

operated at 0.28 MPa pressure and 2000 or 3200 rpm rotation speed) and three boom heights (0.30, 167 

0.50, and 0.70 m) were considered. In accordance with previous studies (van de Zande et al., 2008), 168 

the reference spraying technique was defined as operation of the TeeJet XR 11004 nozzles at 0.30 169 

MPa with a 0.50-m boom height, at a constant forward speed of 6 km h
-1

. This corresponded to an 170 

application volume of 316 l ha
-1

. The boom height was measured from the nozzle tip to the deposit 171 

collectors. The effective forward speed was manually checked by measuring the time required by 172 

the sprayer to cover a distance of 40 m along the spray track. 173 

[Insert Table 1] 174 

2.3 Spray quality assessment 175 

The spray quality obtained for the various examined setups was evaluated through measurements of 176 

the droplet size yielded by the three different nozzle types and the corresponding operative 177 

parameters (Table 1). The droplet size measurements were performed at the DiSAFA Crop 178 

Protection Technology laboratory of Turin University using a Malvern Spraytec laser diffraction 179 

system (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) equipped with a 750 mm lens and with dedicated 180 

software. For each nozzle type, measurements were carried out on a single nozzle in fix position, 181 

0.30 m above the laser beam, which targeted the spray jet in accordance with the nozzle axis. For 182 

each of the four examined setups, the Malvern systems acquired data for at least 60 s for each 183 



measurement, and the tests were repeated three times. The D[v,0.1], D[v,0.5], D[v,0.9], and V100 184 

droplet parameters were calculated.  185 

[Insert Table 2] 186 

2.4 Deposition measurements 187 

The spray solution consisted of a water solution with a tracer of Tartrazine E102 yellow dye (at a 188 

targeted concentration of 10 g l
-1

). This was prepared by pouring a weighed amount of the tracer 189 

powder into the main spray tank, which contained a measured amount of clear water. Using the 190 

sprayer agitation system, the solution was thoroughly mixed for at least 10 min to obtain a uniform 191 

tracer concentration. Before each test, the boom was activated for approximately 60 s in order to 192 

ensure all hoses and nozzles were primed with the spray solution. For each test, one 150-mm Petri 193 

dish collector was placed in each test bench slot, resulting in a total of 22 collectors. As noted 194 

above, two of these collectors were permanently uncovered. 195 

Before each test run, two tank samples were taken from the nozzles in order to measure the actual 196 

tracer concentration, while the sprayer was activated at the set operating pressure in a static 197 

position. These samples were collected and then stored for laboratory analysis in order to obtain the 198 

reference absorbance value. 199 

The permanently uncovered collectors were manually washed in the laboratory using 100 ± 1 ml of 200 

deionised water, and the other collectors (which were only exposed after the sprayer pass) were 201 

washed with 10 ± 1 ml of deionised water. The washings were analysed using a WDR PC 1600 202 

spectrophotometer set at an excitation wavelength of 434 nm (corresponding to the absorption peak 203 

of the Tartrazine tracer). The spray depositions in the Petri dishes (D) were calculated according to 204 

Eq. (1) and expressed in µl cm
-2

, such that 205

where As is the absorbance (ABS, dimensionless) of the Petri dish sample washing, A0 is the 208 

absorbance (ABS, dimensionless) of the washing from a blank Petri dish collected during the indoor 209 

tests, Ar is the absorbance (ABS, dimensionless) of the tank solution, V is the volume of deionised 210 

water (µl) used to wash the sample, and S is the area of the Petri dish collection surface (165 cm
2
). 211 

The variation in the Di obtained in the collectors positioned within the test bench and along the 212 

spray boom travel direction were plotted, in order to obtain the shape of the trailing plume 213 

generated during the spray process. 214 

 215 

2.5 Drift Potential Value Calculation 216 

The drift potential value (DPV) was calculated for each examined setup, following ISO 217 

22401:2015, on the basis of the sum of the spray deposits registered along the test bench. This 218 

calculation considered data from the collectors placed in the slots that were uncovered after the 219 

sprayer pass only (see Eq. (2)). The sum of these deposits was then divided by the reference spray 220 

deposit under the boom (RSD; µl cm
- 2

), which was calculated for each individual test iteration 221 

based on the measured average nozzle flow rate and the effective forward speed. Thus, 222 

DPV = ∑ Di / RSD  100,   (2) 223 

where Di is the spray deposit on a single deposit collector positioned in the covered slots (μl cm
-

224 

2
).The RSD value has a direct influence on the DPV calculation, but this parameter is calculated 225 

using the intended volume rate (l ha
-1

) for which the sprayer is calibrated. In order to verify the 226 

accuracy of the sprayer calibration and, therefore, the reliability of the RSD for the DPV calculation, 227 

two uncovered Petri dishes were placed at the extremities of the test bench for each spray run. 228 

These Petri dishes were used to determine the actual amount of spray deposit recovered under the 229 

boom. 230 

.  231 

2.6 Statistical analysis 232 



The effects of the boom height and nozzle type on the DPV values were evaluated using one-way 233 

analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing, followed by a post hoc comparison using a Tukey test (P < 234 

0.05). The R statistical software package was used in all cases (R Development Core Team, 2012). 235 

The data were transformed (ln [DPV/100]) to yield residual normality and homoscedasticity prior to 236 

the statistical analysis. Moreover, residual analyses were also conducted. In addition, the 237 

relationship between the RSD and Di of the uncovered collectors (μl cm
−2

), which were positioned 238 

at distances 0 and 10.5 m along the test bench, were assessed.  239 

3. Results 240 

3.1 Spray quality assessment 241 

The droplet-size measurements indicated that the TeeJet XR 11004 conventional flat-fan nozzle at 242 

0.30 MPa produced medium droplets, according to the American Society of Agricultural Engineers 243 

(ASAE) classification (Fig. 2a), with a non-negligible volume of fine droplets present in its 244 

spectrum. Specifically, the D[v,10] result was 70 µm (Table 2). Further, the Agrotop TDXL 11004 245 

air-induction flat fan nozzle at 0.30 MPa produced very coarse droplets (Fig. 2b), with a D[v,50] of 246 

467 µm (Table 2), and a reduced amount of very fine droplets in the spray jet (the D[v,10] result 247 

was 186 µm).  The Micron Micromax 3 rotary atomisers generated a more uniform spectrum of 248 

droplets for both tested rotation speeds, as their sizes ranged between 150 and 500 µm. Further, 249 

there was a complete cut-off of fine droplets of fewer than 100 µm in size (Table 2). In addition, the 250 

D[v,10], D[v,50], and D[v,90] values were more similar to one another than in the case of the flat 251 

fan hydraulic nozzles. Therefore, the cumulative volume trend in relation to the droplet size for the 252 

rotary atomiser was very different to the trends observed for the hydraulic nozzles (Fig. 2c and 2d).  253 

[Insert Fig. 2 and Table 2] 254 

3.2. Indoor trials 255 

3.2.1 Effect of boom height 256 



For both of the examined flat-fan nozzle types, it was found that the boom height has a significant 257 

effect on the DPV values (Table 3). For a boom height of 70 cm, the drift was significantly higher 258 

than that for 50 cm, followed again by that for 30 cm (Fig. 4). For conventional hydraulic nozzles, it 259 

is worth noting that the DPV value registered at 70-cm boom height was double (55 ± 3) the DPV 260 

obtained for the 50-cm boom height (25 ± 0.4). Furthermore, the latter value was twice the DPV 261 

measured at the 30-cm boom height (12 ± 1). A similar trend was observed for the air-induction 262 

nozzles.  263 

In absolute terms, the DPV values obtained using the conventional flat-fan nozzles at 30-cm boom 264 

height (DPV = 12 ± 1) were very close to those obtained using the air-induction flat fan nozzles at 265 

70-cm boom height (DPV = 11 ± 1). Considering the obtained DPV value trend, it is also clear that 266 

the effect of boom height is independent of nozzle type (Table 3). These results are in accordance 267 

with the recommendations concerning optimal boom height made by various researchers in the 268 

ambit of the Train Operators to Promote Best Management Practices and Sustainability (TOPPS) 269 

project (see the “Best Management Practices to reduce spray drift” document on the TOPPS website 270 

(TOPPS, 2015)). 271 

The boom height also affected the variability of the results obtained for the various test iterations. 272 

Higher standard errors of the mean (SE) values (Fig. 3) were obtained when the boom height was 273 

increased; this was particularly evident in the case of the conventional flat-fan nozzles. 274 

[Insert Fig. 3, Table 3 ] 275 

3.2.2 Effect of nozzle type 276 

Significant differences among nozzle types were also found (Table 3). For 50-cm boom height, the 277 

largest (25.2) and smallest (1.9) DPV values were obtained for the conventional nozzles and the 278 

Micron Micromax 3 rotary atomisers at 2000 min
-1

 rotation speed, respectively (Fig. 4). Significant 279 

differences in terms of DPV were also found between the two rotation speed settings of the 280 

atomisers (Fig. 4). 281 



A detailed analysis of the combined effects of nozzle type and boom height indicates that 282 

conventional flat-fan nozzles are much more strongly affected by boom height than air-injection 283 

nozzles. This behaviour can be also linked to the droplet sizes and spectral distributions (D50 values 284 

of 193 and 497 µm for conventional and air-injection flat fan nozzles, respectively, and D10 values 285 

of 70 and 186 µm values for the same nozzles, respectively). Note that these results also 286 

demonstrate the efficacy of the test bench for drift evaluation purposes and for discrimination 287 

between the factors affecting drift. Further, these findings are in line with those obtained by Balsari 288 

et al. (2007). 289 

As regards the comparison of the effect of nozzle type at the standard recommended boom height 290 

for flat fan nozzles (50 cm), it is interesting to note (Fig. 4) the large and statistically significant 291 

difference between conventional and air-injection flat-fan nozzles, with the air-injection nozzles 292 

generating a drift potential less than three times that of the conventional nozzles. In these tests, 293 

rotary atomisers were also included, and two different droplet size spectra were obtained by 294 

modifying the rotation speed (2000 and 3200 rpm). Despite the different nozzle designs, the results 295 

indicate that the rotary atomisers have similar tendencies to flat-fan nozzles, with a significantly 296 

lower drift potential that corresponds to a coarser spray quality. 297 

[Insert Fig. 4 and Table 5] 298 

3.2.3 Deposition curves 299 

Figure 5 shows the curves obtained for the conventional and air-injection nozzles at the three 300 

examined boom heights. A detailed analysis of these curves indicates that the majority of the spray 301 

deposits were located within the first 4 and 2 m of the test bench when conventional and air-302 

induction nozzles were employed, respectively. However, the trailing plume shape was very similar 303 

for each nozzle type, and the different boom heights affected the magnitude of the spray deposits 304 

only; therefore, the DPV values were affected, but the spray deposition along the test bench was 305 

not.  306 



To consider the complete curve for the DPV calculation requires taking into account the whole of 307 

the plume of droplets that remains suspended in the air after the boom sprayer passed, especially the 308 

finer droplets which are more susceptible to drift. The spray deposit collected on the first dish of the 309 

test bench, uncovered just after the sprayer pass, often represents the highest drift deposit on the test 310 

bench, but this is not always true. The trend of the deposits on the test bench, does generally 311 

decrease but not always in a systematically, showing some “waves” (see Fig. 5). These irregular 312 

trends of spray deposits along the test bench are more evident when finer spray (i.e. produced by 313 

conventional nozzles) and boom heights over 50 cm are used.  The analysis of the whole plume of 314 

droplets therefore provides more complete information about the potential drift risk.  315 

Figure 6 shows the deposition curves obtained for the two examined rotary atomisers. As expected, 316 

higher Di spray deposition values were found towards the upper end of the test bench when the 317 

Micromax 3 nozzles were operated at a rotation speed of 3200 rpm, which generated finer droplets. 318 

However, when the rotation speed was reduced to 2000 rpm, yielding a coarser spray quality, very 319 

low spray deposits were observed on the test bench collectors. 320 

If nozzle type is the only variable considered in the deposition curve evaluation (Fig. 6), then the 321 

influence of droplet size and droplet spectrum uniformity are clear. The conventional flat-fan 322 

nozzles generated droplets with a D[v,0.1] of 70 m and a V100 of 24.2% (see Table 2), whereas the 323 

rotary atomisers yielded a D[v,0.1] value of 206 m with 0% for V100. These factors, combined 324 

with the significant differences in terms of the volume application rates between the hydraulic and 325 

centrifugal nozzles, seem to have an important effect on the drift potential. 326 

[Insert Fig. 5 and 6] 327 

3.2.4 Relationship between RSD and uncovered Petri dishes 328 

In all tests the recovery rate on the permanently exposed collectors was always >70% of RSD, as 329 

recommended by ISO 22401, proving that the test procedure was followed appropriately. Figure 7 330 

shows the relationship between the theoretical RSD values (based on the intended spray volume 331 

expressed in l cm
-2

) and the actual spray deposits recovered under the boom in all of the tests. In 332 



general, the relationship between the RSD and the spray deposit detected on the uncovered 333 

collectors resulted similar for both test-bench extremities and results were more strictly correlated 334 

when the centrifugal nozzles were employed, with respect to the conventional and air-induction flat-335 

fan nozzles. In all the tests examined the variability of deposits on the permanently uncovered 336 

collectors, assessed by the three replicates, resulted in similar values at the beginning (0 m) and at 337 

the end of the test bench (10.5 m), with CV values generally around 10%. In the eight tests 338 

examined the average ratio between the deposit under the boom and the corresponding RSD ranged 339 

between 86% and 104%. Considering all the tests examined, however, any relationship (P<0.05) 340 

was found between the ratio of the deposit under the boom vs. the corresponding RSD and the DPV 341 

obtained. 342 

 [Insert Fig. 7] 343 

3.2.5 Relationship between DPV and spray quality 344 

The DPV values were also compared in relation to the droplet size spectrum generated by each 345 

evaluated nozzle. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the DPV values and the four most widely 346 

used droplet-spectrum indicators: D[v,0.1], D[v,0.5], D [v,0.9], and V100 (ASABE, 2009; ISO, 347 

2011). Some trends between these parameters and the DPV results were found, especially in the 348 

case of D[v,0.1]. These results are clearly in accordance with those obtained in previous studies, 349 

where the correlation between V100 and the total spray drift was very strongly demonstrated (Legg, 350 

1983; Bode, 1984; Miller, 1988; Western et al., 1989; Bouse et al., 1990; Combellack et al., 1996; 351 

Baetens et al., 2008; Arvidsson et al., 2011; Gil et al., 2014). [Insert Fig. 8] 352 

3.2.6. Drift reduction 353 

By comparing the average DPV values obtained for the eight examined sprayer settings, it was 354 

observed that, in the majority of the cases, the potential drift was lower than that of the reference 355 

value (TeeJet XR 11004 conventional flat-fan nozzles operated at 50-cm boom height). Only when 356 

the boom height was increased to 70 cm for the conventional nozzles was a DPV value higher than 357 

the reference obtained (Table 4). A very high reduction (> 90%) in the potential drift with respect to 358 



the reference sprayer setting was obtained when the air-induction nozzles were operated at 30-cm 359 

boom height, and also when the rotary atomisers were operated at 2000-rpm rotation speed and at 360 

50-cm boom height. 361

 363 

4. Discussion 364 

The experimental results confirmed the conclusions of previous studies (Gil et al., 2014; Gil et al., 365 

2015), i.e., that the test methodology used to assess the potential drift of field crop sprayers 366 

described in ISO Standard 22401:2015 is appropriate, and that it facilitates successful 367 

discrimination between the DPV values obtained for a single sprayer with different test settings 368 

(e.g., different nozzle-type and boom-height combinations). Applying the drift reduction classes 369 

established in ISO 22369-1:2006 to the experimental DPV results, it was, in fact, possible to assign 370 

six sprayer setups to particular drift reduction classes (Table 5). The reference DPV value obtained 371 

using conventional flat-fan nozzles at a boom height of 50 cm was retained throughout the tests. 372 

This classification yielded reliable results, indicating that the coarser the sprayed droplets and the 373 

lower the boom height, the smaller the drift. (This confirms the results obtained by Balsari et al. 374 

(2007)). Further tests are currently being conducted in order to verify whether the classifications 375 

obtained for the examined sprayer settings using the test bench to evaluate the potential drift are 376 

consistent with those obtained for the same sprayer settings under application of the ISO 377 

22866:2005 test methodology (spray drift measurement in the field) or the ISO 22856:2008 test 378 

methodology (spray drift measurement in a wind tunnel). 379 

The obtained results also demonstrate that the indoor use of the test bench facilitates reduced the 380 

variance of the results since the coefficient of variation between the three DPV values obtained for 381 

each examined setup was always found to be within 15%.  382 

 383 

5. Conclusions 384 



This study presented an evaluation of the potential spray drift generated by different combinations 385 

of boom heights and nozzle types for a Delvano HD3 mounted field crop sprayer, using a 386 

previously designed test bench. The experimental results confirmed the robustness of the ISO 387 

22401:2015 test methodology for the measurement of the potential spray drift generated by field 388 

crop sprayers, with the aim of classifying different sprayer settings according to drift risk. 389 

Concerning boom height and nozzle type boom sprayer setting parameters, test results showed the 390 

capability of the test bench and relative ISO standard methodology (ISO 22401) to recognise their 391 

significant effect on DPV. The use of air-induction nozzles compared to standard nozzles at the 392 

same working height, enabled to reduce potential drift between 56% and 91% (see Table 4). 393 

Lowering of boom height from 70 to 50 cm allowed to reduce DPV by 55% and 36% using the 394 

standard and the air induction nozzles respectively (see Table 4).  Further, as the use of test bench 395 

facilitates indoor operation, it allows effective results to be obtained within a short period of time, 396 

because the reproducibility of the results is very high. Moreover, the ISO 22401:2015 test 397 

methodology facilitates comparison of sprayer settings according to drift risk using the full field-398 

crop-sprayer apparatus, similar to field-operation conditions, and not just with a sprayer component 399 

(e.g., a nozzle). Because of the simplicity of this method and the reproducibility of the results, it is 400 

expected that very similar results could be obtained in different laboratories around the world for 401 

the same sprayer settings. The use of an indoor test bench can therefore be considered to be an 402 

effective approach to performing a rapid and reliable drift classification of field crop sprayer 403 

settings. On one hand, the indoor test bench allows the complete sprayer to be employed, as in field 404 

treatments, and on the other hand, the results are not affected by the variable and unpredictable 405 

outdoor environmental conditions.  Further refinements of the DPV calculation method are 406 

envisaged in order to facilitate comparison between the potential drifts obtained for sprayer trial 407 

setups involving different forward speeds (Nuyttens, 2016).     408
