ABSTRACT
Context: Betula pendula Roth (Betulaceae) exhibits many pharmacological activities in humans including
anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral effects. However, the antioxidant activity of BP towards lipid degrad-
ation has not been fully determined.
Objective: The BP ethanol and methanol extracts were evaluated to determine antioxidant activity by an
in vitro method and lyophilized extract of BP was added to beef patties to study oxidative stability.
Materials and methods: Antioxidant activities of extracts of BP were determined by measuring scaveng-
ing radical activity against methoxy radical generated by Fenton reaction 2,20-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothia-
zoline-6-sulphonic acid (TEAC) radical cation, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the ferric
reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The lipid deterioration in beef patties containing 0.1% and
0.3% (w/w) of lyophilized extract of BP stored in 80:20 (v/v) O2:CO2 modified atmosphere (MAP) at 4

�C
for 10 days was determined using thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS), % metmyoglobin and
colour value.
Results: The BP methanol extract revealed the presence of catechin, myricetin, quercetin, naringenin, and
p-coumaric acid. The BP ethanol (50% w/w) extract showed scavenging activity in TEAC, ORAC and FRAP
assays with values of 1.45, 2.81, 1.52mmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g DW, respectively. Reductions in lipid
oxidation were found in samples treated with lyophilized BP extract (0.1% and 0.3% w/w) as manifested
by the changes of colour and metmyoglobin concentration. A preliminary study film with BP showed
retard degradation of lipid in muscle food.
Conclusion: The present results indicated that the BP extracts can be used as natural food antioxidants.

Introduction

Nowadays, consumers are increasingly interested in natural
foods, a healthy diet, and concern about possible toxicological
effects of the synthetic antioxidants used in the food industry.
Natural antioxidants owe their activity mainly from polyphenol
compounds found in most herbal plants, fruits, and vegetables.
Previous studies indicate that consumption of plant foods rich in
antioxidants is beneficial to health and helps to prevent many
diseases such as heart problems, diabetes, neurodegenerative dis-
order and cancers (Halliwell 1996; Decker et al. 2005; Pandey &
Rizvi 2009; Aliakbarlu & Tajik 2012). Moreover, the use of nat-
ural antioxidants to replace synthetic antioxidant in model foods
such as meat burgers and mayonnaise has been studied exten-
sively in recent years. Incorporating natural antioxidants in
muscle foods not only prolonged the shelf life of meat and suc-
cessfully delayed the oxidation process but it also improved the
nutritional quality of the meat (Sanchez-Escalante et al. 2003;
Hayes et al. 2010; Dom�enech-Asensi et al. 2013).

Recent strategy has focused on the development of active
packaging systems based on the incorporation of natural antioxi-
dants into food packaging formulations (G�omez-Estaca et al.
2007; Bao et al. 2009). This eco-friendly biodegradable packaging

not only provides safety benefits to the food, successfully controls
food quality and extends the shelf life, but also replaces commer-
cial non degradable plastic which is harmful to the environment.
Biopolymers used in film preparation are derived from protein
sources which have many advantages and are abundantly avail-
able. Gelatin, which is obtained by collagen hydrolysis, is one of
the popular ingredients in film making and its advantages
include film forming ability (Ali et al. 2014).

To date, biodegradable packaging with a natural antioxidant
coating has attracted great attention, and numerous research
projects are under way in this field (Bao et al. 2009; Ahmad et al.
2012; Bitencourt et al. 2014). Natural antioxidants from plants
chosen for incorporation into the film contain an abundance of
polyphenol constituents. Polyphenols have a wide range of bene-
ficial health effects and their potential for delaying and inhibiting
lipid oxidation has been well studied. A gelatin based film coated
with 25% (w/w) lemongrass essential oil enhanced the quality
and extended the shelf life of sea bass slices (Ahmad et al. 2012).
The incorporation of tea polyphenol-loaded chitosan nanopar-
ticles (TPCN) into a gelatin film improved its antioxidant activ-
ity, whereas phenolic compounds from Curcuma longa Linn
(Rutaceae) rhizomes extract conferred barrier properties and

antioxidant capacity to gelatin-based films (Bao et al. 2009;
Bitencourt et al. 2014).

Betula pendula Roth (Betulaceae) is well known as a birch
tree widely distributed in the northern hemisphere from Canada
to Japan. Birch, in particular, silver birch, has traditionally been
important in many countries where all of the plant parts have
been utilized for various medicinal purposes. Betula pendula (BP)
has been used to treat skin diseases, especially eczema, infections,
inflammations, rheumatism and urinary disorders, and the bud
oil is also widely used as a tonic and as an antiseptic in cosmetic
products, particularly in hair products (J€ager et al. 2008; Jine
et al. 2012; Rosado et al. 2012; Meyer-Hoffert & Brasch 2013).
Furthermore, over the years there have been numerous investiga-
tions of the benefits of plants for human health (EMA: The
European Medicines Agency 2014). Başer and Demirci (2007)
demonstrated the potential of a few Betula species with antifun-
gal, antibacterial and antioxidant effects using various in vitro
techniques. It has been reported by German�o et al. (2012) that
the BP extract contained many polyphenol constituents such as
catechin, p-coumaric acid, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol,
which are known for their free radical scavenging and antioxi-
dant properties. This high content of phenolic compounds may
make Betula species suitable for use as antioxidant sources in the
food industry.

However, the antioxidant activity of BP leaf extract towards
lipid oxidation has not been fully determined yet. Thus, our goals
were (1) to identify the phenolic compounds in a BP extract that
contribute to the antioxidant activity in the plant using LCMS,
(2) to evaluate the antioxidant activity of BP using in vitro assays
including FRAP, TEAC, ORAC and EPR scavenging activity and
(3) to demonstrate the ability of BP extract to inhibit lipid deteri-
oration in beef meat, either by inclusion in the patty composition
or in the formulation of the active packaging.

Materials and methods

Materials

BP leaves were purchased from P�amies Hort�ıcoles (Balaguer,
Spain) in spring 2014 and confirmed taxonomically by Josep
P�amies, the owner of the registered herbal company. Betula pen-
dula is listed in the herbarium of the University of Navarra
(Pamp 3045).

All reagents and solvents used were of analytical grade and
obtained from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) and Sigma Aldrich
(Gillingham, England).

Extraction of Betula pendula

The preparation, extraction and recovery of BP was carried out
according to the method of Azman et al. (2015). Dried leaves
of BP were finely ground using a standard kitchen food proces-
sor. Ground BP was extracted in three different ways: (1) with
50:50 (v/v) ethanol:water; (2) with 75:25 (v/v) ethanol:water and
(3) with 90:10 (v/v) ethanol:water, always in the ratio 1:30
(w/v). The extractions were performed with constant stirring at
4 ± 1 �C for 24 h, in the dark. The extract solutions of BP were
recovered by filtration using Whatman Filter paper, 0.45 lm
(Whatman, GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI). Part of the super-
natant was taken for subsequent use to determine the antiradi-
cal capacity. The volume of the remaining supernatant was
measured and the excess of ethanol was removed under vacuum

using a rotary evaporator (Buchi Re111, Switzerland) and
kept frozen at �80 �C for 24 h. All extracts were dried in a
freeze dryer (Unicryo MC2L �60 �C, Germany) under vacuum
at �60 �C for three days to remove moisture. Finally, lyophi-
lized BP was weighed to determine the soluble solids concentra-
tion (g/L).

Determination of phenolic compound using LCMS

Preparation of 50% (v/v) BP methanol extracts was carried out
as described in the extraction method above. The LCMS ana-
lysis procedure was similar to that reported by Skowyra et al.
(2014) with minor modifications. Compounds were determined
using a LC-ESI–QTOF-MS system acquired from Agilent with a
1200 Series HPLC (Wilmington, DE). The LC instrument has
two isocratic high-pressure mixing pumps, a vacuum degasser
unit and a chromatographic oven. The QTOF mass spectrom-
eter was an Agilent 6520 model, furnished with a Dual-Spray
ESI source. Compounds were separated in an Agilent Zorbax
Eclipse XDB C18 column (100mm� 2mm, 3.5 m) connected
to a C18 (4mm� 2mm) guard cartridge from Phenomenex
(Torrance, CA). Ultrapure water (A) and acetonitrile (B), both
containing 0.1% formic acid, were used as mobile phases apply-
ing the following gradients: 0–10min, 3% B; 15–17min, 100%
B; 11min 3% B. The mobile phase flow was 0.2mL/min, the
injection volume for standards and sample extracts was 10 lL
and the column temperature was set at 30 �C. The mobile phase
flow was 0.2mL/min, using the gradients: 0–10min, 3% B;
10–25min, 100% B; 27–38min, 3% B. Nitrogen (99.999%), was
used as nebulizing (35 psi) and drying gas (330 �C, 10 �C/min)
(Carburos Met�alicos, A Coru~na, Spain). The QTOF instrument
was operated in the 2GHz mode (Extended Dynamic Range,
mass resolution from 4500, at m/z 100, to 11,000, at m/z 900)
and compounds were ionized in positive ESI, applying capillary
and fragmentor voltages of 3500 and 160 V, respectively. The
Mass Hunter Workstation software was used to control all the
acquisition parameters of the LC-ESI-QTOF-MS system and
also to process the obtained data. Full scan MS spectra were
acquired in the range from 100 to 1700 m/z units. The identifi-
cation of polyphenol composition was based on the accurate
masses, isotopic abundances and spacing of signals in their
cluster of ions ([MþH]þ), obtained in the MS mode, as well as,
on their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and the exact mass of
product ions.

Determination of the total phenolic content (TPC)

The Folin–Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total
phenolic content (TPC) as reported by Santas et al. (2008).

Determination of free radical scavenging activity assays

Antioxidant capacity determination in vitro

Three different methods were used for the evaluation of the anti-
oxidant activity of the extracts: 2,20-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazo-
line)-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS·þ) TEAC assay (Almajano et al.
2008), Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay
(Skowyra et al. 2014) and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant
Power (FRAP) method (Gallego et al. 2013). Results were
expressed as lM of Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry
weight of plant (DW).

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy radical
scavenging assay

EPR radical scavenging activity was measured following the
method of Azman et al. (2014a). The extraction was executed in
MeOH with 1:10 (w/v) ratio and the soluble concentration of BP
was determined by lyophilization. A spin-trapping reaction mix-
ture consisted of 100 lL of DMPO (35mM); 50 lL of H2O2
(10mM); 50 lL BP extract at different concentrations or 50 lL of
ferulic acid used as reference (0–20 g/L) or 50 lL of pure MeOH
used as a control; and, finally, 50 lL of FeSO4 (2mM), added in
this order. The final solutions (125lL) were passed to a narrow
(inside diameter ¼2mm) quartz tube and introduced into the
cavity of the EPR spectrometer. The spectrum was recorded
10min after the addition of the FeSO4 solution, when the radical
adduct signal is greatest. X-band EPR spectra were recorded with
a Bruker EMX-Plus 10/12 spectrometer under the following con-
ditions: microwave frequency, 9.8762GHz; microwave power,
30.27mW; centre field, 3522.7G; sweep width, 100G; receiver
gain, 5.02� 104; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation
amplitude, 1.86G; time constant, 40.96ms; conversion time,
203.0ms.

Determination of antioxidant activity in food model

Preparation of beef patties

The initial preparation method of beef patties was adapted from
Azman et al. (2014b). The meat was divided into 4 batches and
was mixed with 1.5% NaCl (w/w) and either (i) control (no add-
ition), (ii) 0.1% BHT, (iii) 0.1% lyophilized BP, (iv) 0.3% lyophi-
lized BP and moulded into smaller portions (about 20 g each).
The modified atmosphere was maintained by using polystyrene
B5-37 (Aerpack) trays which were placed in BB4L bags (Cryovac)
of low-gas permeability (8–12 cm3 m2/24 h). The air in the trays
was flushed with 80:20 (v/v) O2:CO2 by EAP20 mixture
(Carburos Metalicos, Barcelona) and the trays were packaged.
Samples were stored in the dark at 4 ± 2 �C for 10 days to analyze
the extent of oxidation by the thiobarbituric acid reactive sub-
stances (TBARS) method, % metmyoglobin, colour, pH and
microbial quality. Every measurement was carried out in tripli-
cate each day for 10 days (except for microbiological analysis
which was done every 3 days).

Thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS)

Lipid peroxidation was taken as an indicator of oxidative damage
and was assessed by measuring the content of thiobarbituric acid
reactive substances (TBARS) (Grau et al. 2000). The modified
method was adapted from Azman et al. (2014b). All results were
reported in mg malondialdehyde per kg of sample (mg MDA/kg
sample).

Colour measurement and metmyglobin percentage

Objective measurements of colour were performed using a CR
400 colorimeter (Minolta, Osaka, Japan). Each patty was cut and
the colour of the slices was measured three times for each point.
A portable colorimeter with the settings: pulsed xenon arc lamp,
0� viewing angle geometry and aperture size 8mm was used to
measure meat colour in the CIELAB space (Lightness, L�; red-
ness, a�; yellowness, b�). Before each series of measurements,
the instrument was calibrated using a white ceramic tile.

The metmyoglobin percentage was determined by the method
developed by Xu et al. (2010). All sample measurements were
carried out in triplicate.

Development of gelatin-film with antioxidant coating

The fabrication and characterization of the gelatin based film
with antioxidant coating was based on the method of Bodini
et al. (2013). Whilst the filmogenic solution was cooled after the
solubilization of sorbitol, 0.1% (w/w) of BP extract/gelatin and
0.1% (w/w) BHT/gelatin was added. The lipid degradation was
measured using the TBARS method as mentioned above.

Statistical analysis

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using
Minitab 16 software program (a¼ 0.05). The results were pre-
sented as mean values (n� 3).

Results and discussion

Extraction yield, total phenolic content (TPC) and
antioxidant activity

A number of studies have found that the antioxidant activity of
BP extracts correlates with the phenolic content, and thus the
identification of the phenolic compounds in the plant extract
may reveal compounds responsible for its antioxidant activity in
various assays (German�o et al. 2012; Bertrams et al. 2013;
Raudon _e et al. 2014). Five polyphenol constituents were found in
the 50% methanol extract of BP (Table 1) which had all been
reported previously (German�o et al. 2012, 2013). Moreover, pre-
vious studies found more than 26 polyphenol constituents in the
methanol extract including kaempferol and its derivatives.
Studies of the Betula spp. constituents including BP have been
reported by a few authors (German�o et al. 2012; EMA: The
European Medicines Agency 2014). The chemical composition of
flavonoids as the main polyphenolic group of constituents in
birch leaves has been investigated quite extensively for several
years. For example, Raal et al. (2015) developed the use of phen-
olic compounds as chemical indicators of a few birch species
while Evans (2000) identified the chemical structures of quercetin
and hyperoside as the main flavonoids in a BP extract. Among
the components listed above, quercetin has been reported as the
main active ingredient of birch leaves and a possible synergistic
action of several flavonoids and phenolic components has also
been described in BP active ingredients (EMA: The European
Medicines Agency 2014). Isolation of flavonoid constituents from
BP was investigated due to their numerous pharmacological ben-
efits in human health.

Analysis of total polyphenols and free radical activity assays

Total phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity

On average, BP extraction with 50% ethanol produced greater
dry weight of soluble extract than 75% and 90% ethanol. Ethanol
was selected for use in the extraction solvent since the alcohol is
recognized as a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) material
which can be used for applications in the food industry
(Fern�andez-Agull�oa et al. 2013). Ethanol is also effective in the
extraction of flavonoids and their glycosides, catechols and tan-
nins from raw plant materials. Raal et al. (2015) reported that

20% of ethanol gives the highest polyphenol yield analyzed by
net area under the curve (AUC) in HPLC chromatograms.

Table 2 shows that 50% ethanol extraction gave significantly
higher value of phenol content compared to 90% and 75% etha-
nol extraction (p< 0.05). Generally, BP extracted with 50% etha-
nol showed higher antioxidant activity values in the ORAC
assays (p< 0.05). Fern�andez-Agull�oa et al. (2013) demonstrated
higher values of phenolic content and TEAC values of the etha-
nol extract than petroleum ether Soxhlet extracts. The ORAC
assay gave the highest antioxidant activity values compared to
the FRAP and TEAC assays, and showed the scavenging activity
of the extract towards peroxy radicals (OOH·) generated in the
assay. The literature has reported the antioxidant activity of BP
analyzed using the DPPH method, nitric oxide scavenging activ-
ity and the reducing power assay. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of the antioxidant activity of extracts from
BP assessed using the ORAC methods.

EPR scavenging radical assay

The EPR radical scavenging method has been developed by
Azman et al. (2014a) to evaluate the free methoxy radical
(CH3O

·) generates by Fenton reaction and this was applied to
the BP extract. Figure 1 showed the decreasing signal of EPR
with increasing concentration of BP extract. The free radical
scavenging activity of BP extracts against methoxy (CH3O

·) rad-
ical was investigated by a competitive method in the presence of
DMPO as spin trap, using EPR spectroscopy. The CH3O

· radical
generated according to the Fenton procedure has a relatively
short half-life but was identified by EPR because of its ability to
form a stable nitroxide adduct with DMPO, DMPO-OCH3
(hyperfine splitting constants, aN¼ 13.9 G and aH¼ 8.3G). This
stable DMPO-OCH3 compound can be detected by the double
integration value of the signal from the EPR spectrum. The BP
extract at different concentrations competed with the spin trap
DMPO in the scavenging of methoxy radicals. Thus, the antioxi-
dant decreased the amount of radical adducts and, accordingly,
decreased the intensity of the EPR signal. The best fitting with
intensity of EPR signal was shown as exponential function

(Figure 1) that, if concentration values are in g/L, corresponds to
Equation (1):

y ¼ 74:959e� 0:003x; R2 ¼ 0:964 (1)
The graph indicates the exponential relationship of the

decrease in signal in the spectrum as the concentration of BP
increased. This study confirmed that the scavenging activity of
the BP extracts containing polyphenol constituents could be
measured by the decrease of the intensity of the spectral bands of
the adduct DMPO-OCH3 in the EPR spectrum. The radical scav-
enging activity of BP has been previously determined by various
methods, including the DPPH radical scavenging activity and the
ferrous ion-chelating activity as reported by German�o et al.
(2013). However, this study is the first report of the measure-
ment of BP extracts potential to act as an antiradical compound
by scavenging methoxy radicals generated from the Fenton
reaction.

Antioxidant activity in food model

Colour and % metmyoglobin

Meat colour is one of the most important parameters that indi-
cate meat quality. The colour values representing lightness (L�),
redness (a�), and yellowness (b�) are shown in Table 3. The ini-
tial mean lightness (CIE L�) was 29.773 ± 0.866, and the control
sample showed the highest value of L� at the end of 10 days
storage. The L� values showed the increase in lightness of the
meat due to the increased fat percentage but the redness was
reduced. At the end of the storage period, samples containing
0.3% BP demonstrated the lowest value of L� while the sample
containing BHT and the sample containing 0.1% BP displayed
similar values. Our results were in good agreement with those of
Triki et al. (2013) and Hayes et al. (2010) who showed that
reduced fat in muscle food tends to reduce L� and increase a�
when compared to control fat products, while redness decreased
and lightness increased with storage time. Few authors have
reported that lipid oxidation results in a decrease in redness
(P�erez-�Alvarez & Fern�andez-L�opez 2009; Kim et al. 2013a,
2013b). Beef patties containing 0.3% BP maintained a more red
color (a�) throughout the display, whereas the control beef pat-
ties became discoloured from 6 days onwards in the MAP. All
samples showed a significant decrease of red colour after 8 days
storage (p< 0.05).

Consumers scrutinize meat freshness by its visual redness and
the red colour reflects the state of oxidation of the pigment in
the meat (Kim et al. 2013a). At the end of storage, the a� value
of the control sample was significantly lower (p� 0.05) than that
of the other samples tested. Therefore the natural plant extracts
affected meat colour and was potentially useful in delaying the
oxidation and discoloration of the meat product. In general, no
significant differences (p> 0.05) were observed in the b� values
of samples during storage. The present findings seem to be con-
sistent with other research which found that yellowness in meat
patties is not influenced by time of storage and packaging condi-
tions (Kim et al. 2013b; Triki et al. 2013). Meanwhile,

Muthukumar et al. (2012) and Rojas and Brewer (2007) reported
that the b� value of cooked and raw patties with antioxidants
showed a more gradual reduction compared to control during
storage.

The changes in BP-treated samples and the effect of BHT on
MMb formation during storage are presented in Figure 2. Both
control and treated samples, upon storage showed an increase
(p< 0.001) in MMb formation (p> 0.05). The MMb value relates
to the instrumental colour a� values. Free radicals produced by
lipid oxidation in meat are susceptible to initiate the reaction of
oxidizing oxymyoglobin (red colour) to metmyoglobin (brown
colour) which results in the discoloration of meat during storage.

Samples treated with antioxidant can reduce the oxidation of
metmyoglobin by scavenging hydroxyl radicals produced from
oxidation of oxymyoglobin. This finding is supported by several
authors who observed that the decrease of colour in muscle food
is influenced by the decrease in metmyoglobin concentration
during storage (Formanek et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2010).

TBARS analysis in beef patties

The effect of different concentrations of BP and BHT on TBARS
values in meat patties during the 10 days storage at 4 �C is
shown in Figure 3. The TBARS values of all samples treated with
antioxidant were significantly (p< 0.05) reduced compared with
the control throughout the storage period in the MAP atmos-
phere. However, the BHT sample and 0.1% BP sample were not
significantly different throughout storage. This showed that 0.1%
BP would be sufficient to inhibit the generation of MDA signifi-
cantly and was similar in activity to 0.1% BHT in MAP. 0.3%
(w/w) BP displayed the lowest TBARS values with less than
1.0mg malondialdehyde/kg sample at the end of the storage
time; and this indicates that the sample experienced a strong
antioxidant effect. The 0.1% BHT was added as comparison and
is an effective dose within the legal limitation for use in food
(Post et al. 2007). The effect of BP extract on lipid oxidation in
meat has never been reported. Reduction of lipid oxidation with
BP in meat patties in MAP could be attributed to the presence of
polyphenols, rich in catechins as well as other flavonoids. The
active properties of BP have been previously reported by many
authors (German�o et al. 2012; Bertrams et al. 2013; Raal et al.
2015). Our LCMS study also showed the presence of phenolic
acids in the extract which may contribute to inhibition of lipid
oxidation in the meat. The antioxidant activity of phenolic com-
pounds is closely related to the hydroxyl group linked to the aro-
matic ring which is capable of donating hydrogen atoms and
neutralizing free radicals. This mechanism blocks further degrad-
ation of active oxidized compounds such as MDA, which can be
measured by the TBARS method (Kim et al. 2013a, 2013b). The
study confirmed the potential of BP extract to inhibit lipid deg-
radation in beef patties.

TBARS analysis in beef with active packaging

Meat packed under films coated with antioxidants, namely, BP
and BHT applied at 0.1%, experienced a decrease in lipid oxida-
tion compared to the control sample. At the first days of assay,
no significant differences between the samples tested were
observed. The significant differences in TBARS values occurred
at day 2 (p< 0.05) and differences continued until 17 days stor-
age. The samples containing synthetic and natural antioxidant
showed a tendency to be marginally different (p< 0.1) through-
out the storage period. The TBARS values of meat packed under
films with 0.1% of antioxidant product also showed a significant
reduction in lipid oxidation of the meat throughout the entire
storage period compared to control. The increased food stability
of samples containing BP and BHT can be seen in Figure 4, and
it can be pointed out that the marginal difference between sam-
ples containing BP extract and BHT, which is recognized as an
important antioxidant, demonstrates the effectiveness of the nat-
ural antioxidant as an alternative preservative for the food indus-
try. The literature reports that BP contained many phenolic
compounds that contribute to its strong antioxidant activity as
shown by several assays (German�o et al. 2012; Bertrams et al.
2013; EMA: The European Medicines Agency 2014).

Raudon_e et al. (2014) demonstrated that the phenolic compo-
nents of the BP extracts (which include hyperoside and chloro-
genic acid) possess strong antioxidant activity when measured by
the HPLC-FRAP post column assay. Our LCMS analysis of the
BP extract showed that a few phenolic constituents such as cat-
echin and p-coumaric acid exhibited antioxidant activity that has
the potential to contribute to many pharmacological benefits to
humans including antioxidant, and anticancer effects (Yeh & Yen
2003; Duthie et al. 2013; Kiliç & Yeşilo�glu 2013; Nithiyanantham
et al. 2013). Moreover, many constituents present in the BP
extract correlated significantly with antioxidant activity measured
by ORAC and TEAC assays and may play important roles in the
detoxification of endogenous compounds in humans (Yeh & Yen
2003).

This study was undertaken with the aim of assessing the
potential effects of BP extract in delaying lipid oxidation in a
food model. Beside the promising result of antioxidant activity

and the presence of polyphenols in the extract, this is a prelimin-
ary study of the properties of gelatin-based film containing BP
extract for environmental friendly packaging for foods. Duthie
et al. (2013) demonstrated the presence of phenolic acids includ-
ing p-coumaric acid measured using LCMS in chicken patties
mixed with vegetable powders. The compound found in Duthie
et al. (2013) work is relevant to our findings that the BP extract
gave a good protective effect to the meat patties. Furthermore,
our work also showed the efficacy of gelatin-based films treated
with 0.1% BP extract.

Conclusions

The BP extract prepared with 50% aqueous ethanol showed a
high phenolic content and antioxidant activity measured by the
FRAP, TEAC and ORAC assays. The various polyphenol constit-
uents present in the BP extract contribute to the antioxidant
activity and total polyphenol content. The BP extract showed
scavenging ability against methoxy radicals generated by the
Fenton reaction assessed by EPR. Lyophilized extracts of BP
(0.1% and 0.3% w/w) can be applied as antioxidants in meat pat-
ties since these extracts inhibited lipid oxidation significantly in
samples packed under MAP. 0.3% of lyophilized extract of BP
significantly decreased the discoloration of meat and the brown
color measured by the metmyoglobin assay. A preliminary study
of the effect of gelatin-based film coated with 0.1% (w/w) BP
showed that it significantly delayed degradation of lipid in meat
(p< 0.05). Therefore, this study confirms that BP as a source of
antioxidants has potential to be used by the food industry.
