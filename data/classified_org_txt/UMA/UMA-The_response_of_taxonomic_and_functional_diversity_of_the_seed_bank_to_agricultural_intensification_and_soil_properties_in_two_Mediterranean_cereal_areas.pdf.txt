Weed seed bank diversity has been severely impacted by agriculture intensifi cation. 
However, the functional consequences have been poorly studied in highly intensifi ed 
agro-ecosystems. This study evaluated the importance of soil properties and agriculture 
intensifi cation at local and at landscape scale on taxonomic and functional diversity and in the 
distribution of functional traits of plants represented in the soil seed bank in conventionally 
managed cereal fi elds in two Mediterranean regions of Spain, Andalusia and Catalonia. Local 
intensifi cation was measured by means of position in the fi eld (margin, edge and centre) 
which refl ects diff erent intensities of management practices. Intensifi cation at the landscape 
scale was measured with percentage arable land cover within circular sectors of 1 km radius 
around the focus fi eld. Functional diversity index and the distribution of functional traits 
were based on eight traits related to the whole plant life-cycle. In total, 175 and 116 species 
were recorded in the seed bank in Andalusia and Catalonia, respectively. We found that 
taxonomic and functional diversity, and the distribution of functional traits in the weed seed 
bank were unaff ected by soil properties, position in the fi eld or landscape structure in any 
of the two studied regions. The results suggest that intensity of management practices is 
a similar thorough the entire fi eld and fi eld margins fl ora is highly aff ected by adjacent crop 
management. The negligible impact of landscape structure may be due to arable land cover 
was high and the presence of (semi)natural habitats were scarce, therefore the availability of 
alternative habitats acting as a source of propagules is limited. This long-term intensifi cation 
at local and landscape scale has led to the actual communities which are characterized by 
an extremely low functional diversity with functional traits adapted to recurrent disturbance 
and with a high reproduction capacity.
