Foreword 

The SPISE Working Group was established in 2004 during the first SPISE workshop. There the 
participants welcomed the thought of Dr. Eng. Ganzelmeier (JKI) that a working group should work on 
further steps for the harmonization and mutual acceptance of equipment inspections. In the following 
years, thanks to SPISE engagement, a constant exchange of information has been made possible 
within the working group and consultations went on between the EC and MS on improving the 
sustainability of plant protection. 

The founding members of the SPISE working group came from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and 
the Netherlands. 

In the ambit of SPISE working Group several Technical Working Groups (TWG) have been recently 
created with the aim to prepare advice about the items taken into account by the EU Directive 
128/2009/EC but still not considered in the actual ISO/CEN Standards. SPISE TWG 8 in particular, has 
defined advice on what are the parts and the requirements of equipment and the criteria to use for the 
functional inspection of dusters. 

The present document is intended to provide technical indications about the steps to follow for making 
the correct inspection of this equipment.  

 

INTRODUCTION  

It is estimated that about 200000 dusters are actually in use in Europe, especially in the Southern zone. 
As required the EU Directive 128/2009/EC, this type of machines, employed mainly for distributing dry 
sulfur dust in vineyards, are subject to a mandatory functional inspection as all other kinds of 
equipment used for pesticide distribution. 

All types of dusters actually in use, are characterized by a tank where the sulfur dust is contained and by 
a radial fan to generate the air flow for the dust distribution. The main difference between these, is 
represented by the dust extraction system from the tank wherewith it is possible to divide the 
equipment in two different categories:  

A) provided with a tank  with internal air flow;  

B) provided with a tank without air flow.   

The first category includes machines featured by two type of dust extraction system  (figure 1) that 
consist in an adjustable opening at the bottom of the tank, from which the dust can fall on the radial fan 
simply by gravity or by a mechanical system. The sulfur coming from the opening is conveyed towards 
the spouts on the two sides of the machine by the air stream of the radial fan. In the first case (fallen by 
gravity) the precise dosage of the dust, is difficult due to the poor precision of the control system. Also 
the quality of dust distribution is generally poorly uniform (Marucco and Balsari, 2004), with deposits on 
leaves and bunches that generally are below 50% of the amount applied. The second type of dust 
extraction system allow a more precise dosing of the sulfur dust and can improve the quality of dust 
distribution with respect to the first one.  

The second category of dusters regards a more advanced type of machines (figure 2), featured by 
pneumatic systems to extract the powder from the tank. This category and these provided with the 
mechanical dust extraction system allow a more precise dosing of the sulfur dust and can improve the 
quality of dust distribution respect to the conventional models (Marucco and Balsari, 2004). 

Actually no EN or ISO Standards concerning the requirements and methods of brand new dusters 
performances’ verification or for the functional inspection of those in use are available. This considered,

SPISE working Group members believe it is necessary to provide a specific SPISE Advice on how to 
make the functional inspection of dusters following, when possible, the harmonized Standard EN ISO 
16122 (parts 1 for general components and part 3 for dosing systems, if provided) and some of the 
referring documents realized and used by some Member States, where this type of equipment are 
already inspected (Spanish manual for the functional inspection of the sprayers in use downloading at: 
http://www.mapama.gob.es/es/agricultura/temas/medios-de-
produccion/manualdeinspecciondeequiposdeacuerdoalanormaune-en13790_tcm7-422883.pdf). 

This SPISE advice is divided in two different sections, which refer respectively to the pre-inspection and 
to the inspection.  

The first regards all the preliminary controls made by the inspector at the beginning of the inspection 
and mainly consists of visual checks. The parts of this section are common to both categories of dusters 
previously described (A and B). 

The second section regards the test methods and the procedures to realize the functional check of the 
equipment and the instruments necessary to carry out the measurements. For this reason, in some part 
of the section, the test methods described are specific referred to each of the two categories of dusters.
