Summary

Crop-adapted dosing of agrochemicals, i.e. dose adjustment has been widely discussed 
in previous research. In all cases, the main goal has been to adapt the total amount of plant 
protection products (PPP) to crop characteristics, but the most difficult aspect seems to 
select the most suitable crop parameter to be used for dose expression. This situation has 
resulted in a recent proposal by the European agrochemical manufacturing industry to 
harmonise, across Europe, the efficacy evaluation stage of pesticide registration based on 
Leaf Wall Area (LWA) concept. However, other than the problem of the “dose expression 
unit”, which expresses the product quantity in relation to the treated area, the achievement 
of an adequate and optimal volume rate for an intended canopy must be established and 
determined separately.
This research present the results obtained during the spray process on a vineyard plantation 

(var. Merlot) using an IRIS multi-row sprayer (Ilemo-Hardi, S.A.U.) Three different 
adjustments were evaluated from low (250 L 10000 m-2) to high (500 L 10000 m-2) LWA, 
maintaining in all cases the same nozzle size (Albuz ATR lilac) and forward speed. Average 
canopy height was 0.8 m. In order to evaluate the effect of canopy characteristics other than 
crop height, a LIDAR sensor was used for a complete canopy characterization. Research 
was arranged in order to obtain the relation hip between canopy characteristics and the 
most adequate amount of liquid for a homogenous canopy wall.

Key words: Dose expression, LWA, Leaf Wall Area, vineyard, spray volume, optimal 
coverage

Introduction

During the pesticide application process, risk as a function of pesticide dose and harm to sensitive 
non-target areas are both related to the total amount of plant protection products (PPP) and the 
spraying efficiency during the distribution process over the entire canopy. However, for orchard 
and vineyard applications, the different methods commonly used to determine the most suitable 
amount of PPP and the corresponding application volume rate are difficult to understand in most 
cases. A direct consequence of this complexity is that different methods have been proposed for 
the establishment of label dose expression; these different methods make various claims for the 
improved efficiency of pesticide use (Koch et al., 2001; Walklate et al., 2003, 2006, 2011; Koch, 
2007). In all cases, the proposed alternative for dose expression has been linked to one or several 
canopy characteristics with great differences in the measurement difficulty.

Attempts to improve the dose expression procedures have included recommendations based upon 
either two (leaf wall area) or three (tree row volume) dimensional factors related to the canopy 
structure (Gil et al., 2011, 2013; Walklate et al., 2011; Escolà et al., 2013). However, those efforts 
have led to a “chaotic” situation in which a comparison of label instructions for PPP authorized 
in different European countries reveals remarkable differences in dose expression (Koch, 2007). 
This situation has resulted in a proposal by the European agrochemical manufacturing industry 
to harmonize, across Europe, the efficacy evaluation stage of pesticide registration (Wohlhauser, 
2009). Recently studies (Walklate & Cross, 2013) demonstrated that the harmonised method of LWA 
dose expression for efficacy may be easily implemented as a regulated model of dose adjustment, 
without any need for an explicit value of the LWA dose rate on the product label. Furthermore, it 
has been demonstrated that the LWA dose adjustment model can easily be generalised to make use 
of additional information where this is available for the special canopy density parameter.
The main objective of this research was to evaluate different LWA values and its effect in the 

spray distribution quality in a typical Spanish vineyard.

Materials and Methods

This study was carried out in a vineyard plantation (var. Merlot) located in Castell del Remei 
(Lleida, NE Spain). In average, vineyard had a height of 80 cm and row spacing was 3.2 m. 

Equipment and working parameters
All treatments were performed using an IRIS multi-row sprayer (Ilemo-Hardi, S.A.U.) (Fig. 1). 

Based on the concept of LWA, three different dose adjustment were evaluated: high dose – 500 L 
10000 m-2, 2) medium dose – 350 L 10000 m-2 and 3) low dose – 250 L 10000 m-2. Table 1 shows 
the main working conditions for each treatment.

Evaluation of spray quality process
For each treatment application coverage in three heights (top, middle and bottom) and three depths 

(left, centre and right) was evaluated using water sensitive paper (WSP) in four replicates (vines).  
After spraying, water sensitive papers were collected and scanned by a scanner with a resolution 
of 600 dpi non interpolated, with 24-bit. Percentage coverage in each one was evaluated by Image 
J® software.

Electronic characterization of the canopy
LIDAR was used to characterize the vines where WSP were placed. The LIDAR characterization 

was made using the same procedure described in the work of Llorens et al. (2011a). The LIDAR 
sensor was mounted in a mast attached to one platform and carried by one tractor, the laser sensor 
scanned completely the row sided on the left when the tractor travels along the field. At the same 
time, a GPS system was mounted at top of the same mast to know exactly the global position of 
the system. This system of positioning is based in a precise DGPS (Differential Global Positioning 
System) with enough accuracy to georeference each point collected by LIDAR sensor, each point 
was processed following the process described in Llorens et al. (2011b). Once the LIDAR data is 
positioned to global position by UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates, it is possible 
to extract crop parameters through the analysis of the cloud of points (Fig. 2). In this work the 
parameters extracted were: LIDAR impacts, LAI, height of crop and width of crop. Each of these 
parameters was correlated to the position where the collectors of deposition were placed. It is 
interesting to remark the variability of LAI and canopy height detected by the Lidar sensor. For 
the purpose of this research only the average values were taken into account for the calculation 
parameters. However, this fact should be considered to improve the spray application process using 
electronic devices.

Data analysis
Mean of coverage percentage of dose treatments were compared by one-way ANOVA followed 

Student–Newman–Keul's test. Data were transformed using a logarithmic transformation (before the 
statistical analysis in order to homogenize variances. Additionally coverage percentages in vertical 
and horizontal position were also statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using 
R software (R Core Team, 2012).

Results

 The evaluation process of the spray application is based in the analysis of two main factors: a) 
deposition on the leaf surface area, represented by the percentage of coverage measured on every 
single water sensitive paper; and b) the uniformity of deposition in the whole canopy, evaluated 
through the values of standard deviation among all the samples on every single repetition.

Coverage of leaf surface
 Table 2 shows the average value of coverage obtained with the three different theses in terms of 
volume rate per LWA surface. The statistical analysis indicates no statistically differences between 
350 and 500 L ha-1 LWA, while 250 L ha-1 LWA gave the lower value of coverage, being in this 
case different to the other two.

For each dose treatment, mean values with different letters in rows indicate significant differences depending 
on the canopy width (Student Newman Keuls, P<0.05). Also mean values with different letters in columns 
indicate significant differences depending on the canopy height (Student Newman Keuls, P<0.05).  SME 
indicates the standard error of the mean.

A detailed evaluation of the coverage distribution in the whole canopy and its variation depending 
on canopy height and/or canopy density can be observed in Table 3 which indicates the single values 
of % of coverage for all the nine sample points selected in the whole canopy.
The results inTable 3 indicate how position of samples according canopy height influence much 

more than position in the external or internal part of the canopy, for low or medium volume rates,

just the opposite that occurs in the case of the highest volume rate, where horizontal position of the 
samples (external or internal placement) produced statistically differences on the coverage values.
Graphical representation of those values can be observed in Fig. 3. In this case not only the coverage 

values, but also the spatial distribution on the canopy, are being an interesting indicator of the spray 
distribution among the canopy. A global analysis of the figure tends to select the medium value of 
application rate (350 L ha-1 LWA) as optimal value for spray applications in vineyard.

Uniformity of deposition
The second parameter used for spray distribution analysis was the quantification of the uniformity 

distribution of the spray among the canopy. For this purpose the standard deviation of all the 
coverage values obtained in the whole sample were calculated for every treatment. Table 4 indicates 
the values of standard deviation obtained with the different volume rates.

Dose treatment 250 L ha-1 LWA 350 L ha-1 LWA 500 L ha-1 LWA
Standard deviation (σ) 28.7 A 28.9 a 25.2 a

For each dose treatment, mean values with different letters indicate significant differences (Student Newman 
Keuls, P<0.05).

Results indicate no statistical differences among the treatments in terms of uniformity of deposition, 
which clearly indicates that there are no benefits when increasing the spray volume rate (Table 4). 
These results must be evaluated together with Fig. 3 on which, in spite of the values of the standard 
deviation, a better uniformity can be observed in the case of 350 L ha-1 LWA.
  Fig. 4 represents the relation between coverage and the distribution uniformity in the whole canopy, 
measured by the standard deviation of all the samples placed in the vegetation. It is interesting to 
observe how in all cases the values of coverage were placed in the range from 25‒50%, or even 
more in the case of the highest volume rate, giving an adequate result for most of the particular 
requirements depending on the pesticide/disease/pest. However, it is difficult to observe any 
influence of volume rate in the uniformity of distribution in the whole canopy.

Canopy variation along the sprayed row was not too important. However, it is interesting to 
remark that in some cases the differences between values of canopy width can range from 0.39 
(lowest case) to 0.79 (the widest zone), and also LAI can vary from 1.52 to 2.23, affecting those 
variations to the spray distribution.
A further analysis of canopy data obtained with Lidar sensor indicates (Fig. 5) the good relationship 

between canopy height and canopy width. It is interesting to remark also the good estimation of leaf 
area index through the canopy height values, following the LWA procedure for the establishment 
of dose expression.

Conclusions

These preliminary results indicate that a spray volume rate based on LWA concept seems interesting 
to be adopted for the volume establishment in vineyard crops.
According the canopy measurements obtained with Lidar sensor, canopy height can be used as a 

good structural parameter to estimate leaf area index, and so, a good, easy measurable and interesting 
parameter for the establishment of the most appropriate volume rate and dose expression.
Further development of this research should be implemented in different crop stages in order to 

check the LWA value in the whole vegetative stages in vineyard. Obtained results could be used 
for pesticide companies for a most suitable dose expression method based on canopy structure.
