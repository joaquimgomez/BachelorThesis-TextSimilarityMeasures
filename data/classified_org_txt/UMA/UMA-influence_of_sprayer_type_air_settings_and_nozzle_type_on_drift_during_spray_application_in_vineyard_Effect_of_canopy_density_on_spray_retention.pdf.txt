INTRODUCTION 
 
Sprayer types, as well as working parameters, have direct influence on the amount 

of spray retained on the canopy.  This research was focused on the quantification of spray 
amount that exceeded the last canopy row during the spray application in a vineyard 
parcel. 

LIDAR sensor was selected as alternative method for drift measurements, 
following the previous research (Gil et al., 2013). The objective of this research was to 
evaluate the effect of canopy characteristics on drift, by measuring the amount of liquid 
exceeding the last sprayed row, and compare the ground deposition out of the target area 
with the measurements obtained with LIDAR sensor. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
A conventional mistblower sprayer and a multi row sprayer were tested at 38.000 

m3/h and 7.000 m3/h respectively, applying an average rate of 369-398 l/ha. Conventional 
hollow cone (ATR Albuz nozzles) and air injection nozzles (TVI Albuz nozzles) were 
used separately maintaining the same other working parameters (Table 1). Canopy 
characteristics of the complete nine last rows of the parcel were obtained using a LiDAR 
SICK LMS 200. Previous circulation on the field with the tractor equipped with LiDAR 
sensor allowed to obtain the canopy maps with detailed information about canopy 
density, canopy height, and canopy width along the row lines.

Spray amount of liquid exceeding the canopy was measured using two different 
methodologies: a) two ad hoc horizontal 10 m length drift test bench were placed 
horizontally to the last row line at 1.6 and 3.2 m respectively (half and entire row 
distance, respectively). Petri dishes were disposed over the bench at a distance of 0.5 m in 
between, in order to catch the amount of sprayer exceeding the canopy; b) LiDAR scan 
was also placed on the ground close to the drift test bench in order to measure/determine 
the amount of droplets exceeding the canopy. For this purpose, LiDAR laser beams were 
directed vertically in parallel to the canopy vegetation, with a range of frequency of 180º. 
Spray droplets density exceeding the canopy was measured for every field trial (Fig. 1).

All treatments were performed using an IRIS multi-row sprayer (Ilemo-Hardi, 

S.A.U.) and a conventional mistblower sprayer (Talleres Corbins, S.A.). Spray tanks were 
filled up to its half capacity with pure water and a certain quantity of a commercial tracer 
(Tartrazine, E-102, SIGMA) in order to obtain a concentration of around 2 g/l. Deposition 
of tracer on petri dishes was analysed by spectrophotometry. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Results indicated the great correlation between air settings, canopy density and 

drift exceeding the target. Values greater than 8,000 m3/h gave the greatest spray losses 
away from the target. Also it was interesting to evaluate the positive effect of air injection 
nozzles on drift reduction. Alternative measurement procedures for drift measurement, as 
LiDAR sensor, seem interesting to be taken into account.
