Abstract: Accurate crown characterization of large isolated olive trees is vital for adjusting 

spray doses in three-dimensional crop agriculture. Among the many methodologies 

available, laser sensors have proved to be the most reliable and accurate. However, their 

operation is time consuming and requires specialist knowledge and so a simpler crown 

characterization method is required. To this end, three methods were evaluated and 

compared with LiDAR measurements to determine their accuracy: Vertical Crown 

Projected Area method (VCPA), Ellipsoid Volume method (VE) and Tree Silhouette 

Volume method (VTS). Trials were performed in three different kinds of olive tree plantations: 

intensive, adapted one-trunked traditional and traditional. In total, 55 trees were 

characterized. Results show that all three methods are appropriate to estimate the crown 

volume, reaching high coefficients of determination: R2 = 0.783, 0.843 and 0.824 for 

VCPA, VE and VTS, respectively. However, discrepancies arise when evaluating tree 

plantations separately, especially for traditional trees. Here, correlations between LiDAR 

volume and other parameters showed that the Mean Vector calculated for VCPA method 

showed the highest correlation for traditional trees, thus its use in traditional plantations is 

highly recommended.

1. Introduction 

Increased awareness of the safe use of pesticides has led to substantial developments in the 

European environmental legal framework. Since the publication of the European Directive for a 

Sustainable Use of Pesticides in 2009 [1], great efforts have been made by all EU members to reduce 

the associated risks during the phase-use of pesticides. Of particular importance, is the  

need to establish procedures for identifying the most suitable dose and volume rate, especially in 

“three-dimensional” crops, such as orchards, vineyards, citrus and olive tree plantations. Establishing 

the most accurate volume rate for pesticide application in those crops appears to be one of the most 

difficult aspects, with most growers using a certain amount of subjectivity. There are several parameters 

that directly influence sprayer calibrations, and these are in turn, influenced by many external factors. In 

addition, uncontrollable factors such as weather conditions, pest and/or disease infestation, and crop 

development and its structure affect the final success of the spray application process. 

Attempts to improve procedures to identify pesticide dose expression have included 

recommendations based upon either two (Leaf Wall Area: LWA) or three (Tree Row Volume: TRV) 

dimensional factors related to the canopy structure [2–4]. The high degree of variability in the crop 

canopy has hampered the development of general solutions to guarantee efficacy during the spraying 

process [5] and ensure that the most appropriate amount of pesticide is applied to all leaf surfaces with 

an even distribution, for crops of all types and in all situations. 

According to that it is clear that precise measurements of external canopy dimensions leads to 

improved identification of pesticide dose. The chosen method for canopy characterisation, such as 

height and width is therefore of huge importance, and should be arranged by growers before spraying.  

There are considerable differences between canopy characterization processes for a uniform canopy 

wall (i.e., vineyard, orchards) and individual, isolated large trees, such as traditional olive tree 

plantations in the south of Europe. Olive tree plantations and olive oil production represent one of the 

most important incomes and activities in the agricultural sector on Mediterranean area with a total area 

of 7.7 Mha and a production over 11.6 MTm per year, and Spain is the largest producer of olive oil 

globally [6]. New alternative trellis systems have been adopted and developed for new olive tree 

plantations in recent years, to enable intensive farming. These produce increased tree density and a 

homogeneous canopy distribution along the row, but this represents only 2% of the olive cultivated area 

in Spain [7]. Further, traditional olive tree plantations represent 76% of total cultivated area, and 

intensive plantations represent 22% of cultivated area. Here, single, isolated and in most cases large, 

wide and heterogeneous canopy shapes can be identified. It is widely accepted that intensive orchards 

are more profitable than their traditional counterparts, due to the higher plantation density and the 

possibility of mechanical harvesting. As a result, there have been attempts to convert traditional 

plantations into intensive ones, by leaving one only trunk per tree, in order to allow the trunk shakers 

to harvest and plant new trees in between existing trees.

According to previous research, canopy measurement methods to characterise the whole tree 

structure can be classified in two groups: manual measurements and electronic procedures to estimate 

the most important tree dimensions. A range of manual methods for canopy characterisation has been 

widely applied to isolated trees. Among them, the ellipsoid method is the most widely used [8,9]. This 

method is impacted by the location of the measuring point selected for each tree, and so some authors 

propose to establish measurements at different heights of the canopy [10] to increase measurement 

precision. 

Alternatively, the method of delimiting and measuring the projected area of the tree crown [11] has 

been proposed as a manual measurement process. Vertical crown projection onto the soil can be 

related to canopy volume [12]. Several possibilities for crown projection were established by the same 

authors, who proposed another canopy characterization methodology named tree silhouette. Tree 

canopy volume is estimated after applying the second theorem of Pappus Guldinus [13].  

Electronic measurement methods use ultrasonic sensors and laser based sensors to estimate canopy 

characteristics. Ultrasonic sensors have been used for canopy volume measurements in vineyards [14–16], 

orchard fruits [4,17,18], and citrus plantations [10,19] due to its easy operation and management  

and affordable real-time data processing. However, there are doubts as to the accuracy of such 

measurements [20,21]. Further, laser technology has been found to achieve higher precision in 

comparison with ultrasonic sensors [14,19]. 

Laser technology is one of the most precise methods for canopy characterization [22] when applied 

to a range of crops using LiDAR 2D technology [22–26]. Furthermore, laser technology has been well 

implemented in olive tree canopies, where a complete characterization of the tree crown was achieved 

with a 3D laser scanner [27]. In this study, 24 trees belonging to four plots with a tree spacing of 7 × 7 m 

and 6 × 6 m (intensive disposition) were scanned from the top and one side of the crop. Excellent 

results were obtained for crown height, crown width, tree height, crown volume, and foliar density. 

Despite its precision, field management of those electronic devices is complex and not very well 

adapted to real field conditions where PPP must be applied. It may also be unrealistic to propose 

general implementation of these devices for wide use among the growers, due its complexity and cost. 

Conversely, accurate protocols for manual canopy characterization seem much more affordable and  

user-friendly, utilising simple and quick measurements. Whatever the selected method for canopy 

evaluation, it should guarantee some minimum requirements in terms of precision (as close as possible 

to the real canopy dimensions) in order to apply the most suitable amount of pesticide. 

To this end, the aim of this research was to evaluate the accuracy of three different methods for 

manual canopy characterization (ellipsoid method, shade method and tree silhouette method) in 

traditional olive tree plantations, and to compare these with 2D LiDAR electronic measurements as a 

reference. Our objectives were: 

(1) Define alternative manual canopy measurement protocol and compare it with electronic 

methods already in use. 

(2) Evaluate the proposed methodologies in three different canopy types in olive tree plantations: 

intensive, adapted for mechanical harvesting, and traditional. 

(3) Identify the most representative parameters for canopy characterization in olive trees.

2.1. Characteristics of Selected Fields and Tree Plantations 

Characterised trees were placed in two different fields, both of them located in the province of 

Córdoba (Andalusia, Spain), with the first one comprising two study plots: first field (37°45'46.78"N; 

5°2'55.82"W) represents intensive and semi-intensive system, whilst the second field (37°43'8.43"N; 

4°48'20.55"W) represented the traditional (several trunks) system. Plot numbers 1 and 3 present the 

Picual variety and plot 2 the Gordal variety (Table 1 and Figure 1) of olive trees. Plantation patterns 

consisted of square distributions (plot 1 and 2), and a quincunx distribution (plot 3). The selected 

culture systems are the most representative of the Spanish olive tree crop [7].

2.2. Manual Crown Measurement Methods Evaluated 

Three different manual methods for crown measurement were selected: Vertical Crown Projected 

Area method (VCPA), Ellipsoid Volume method (VE), and the Tree Silhouette Volume method (VTS). 

Measurements corresponding to all the proposed methods and evaluated tree types were done the same 

day (Intensive: 25 February 2014, Adapted traditional: 19 March 2014, Traditional: 20 May 2014 and  

2 July 2014) trying to avoid external and undesirable influences. A detailed explanation of the principles 

and procedure arranged for every one of the selected methods appears below. Those methods were 

compared with the results obtained with the electronic measurement method using LiDAR sensor. 

2.2.1. Vertical Crown Projected Area Method (VCPA) 

The VCPA method is based on determining the projection of the tree crown onto the soil and 

determining its area, which can be correlated to its total volume. In order to do so, eight fixed

directions (every 45 degrees) related to the north azimuth were selected for all the trees, (Figure 2) 

around the entire tree circumference. Vectors were measured from the centre of the trunk with a compass 

and a plummet placed in the most external point of the profile for each considered direction. If there 

was only one trunk, it was necessary to add half the Trunk Diameter (Td), which was obtained from the 

trunk circumference at 30 cm height. If there were two trunks, the origin of the vectors was set on the 

medium point between their centres, and if there were three, the origin was set on the barycentre of the 

triangle formed by the three. The Mean Vector parameter ( ) was then calculated as the mean of all 

the measured vectors (Vi) according to Equation (1): = ∑  (1)
where  is the Mean Vector Parameter (m); Vi the single values of the eight measured vectors (m); 

and n the number of vectors for every single tree (8 vectors for a 45° space angling). 

Taking into account the length and direction of every vector, it was possible to determine the 

coordinates of every single point acting as a vertex of the internal polygon (Figure 2) and, therefore, its 

area (APA). 

The internal polygon’s area was calculated following Equation (2) corresponding to the Gauss’s 

area algorithm, also known as shoelace method [23,28]. 

= 12 ∙ ∙ + ∙ − ∙ − ∙  (2)
where xi and yi are the coordinates of each point i.

2.2.2. Ellipsoid Volume Method (VE) 

Ellipsoid volume determination is based on assuming the tree crown to be an ellipsoid (defined by 

three semi axes) and determining its volume. Even though this method has been widely used in other

studies [8,9,29], there is not a well-defined standard measurement protocol to obtain the required 

dimensions. 

In the present study, ellipsoid axes (Ea, Eb and Ec, as shown in Figure 3) were calculated using some 

of the vectors determined for the VCPA method. Therefore, semi axes Eb and Ec were calculated as the 

length of their corresponding vectors in North and East directions. In order to obtain semi axis Ea, the 

total tree height (HT) and the height of the first leaf (Hfl) were measured using a topographic milestone. 

Ea was calculated as the difference between HT and Hfl and divided by 2. The final Ellipsoid Volume 

(VE) was calculated according Equation (3): = 43 × × ×  (3)

 

Figure 3. Parameters defined in the Ellipsoid Volume method. 

2.2.3. Tree Silhouette Volume Method (VTS) 

The Tree Silhouette method (VTS) determines the crown volume by revolutionizing areas delimited 

on pictures taken from various positions around a vertical axis in the centre of the tree. Pictures were 

taken in the same orientation as the VCPA method, with a total of eight pictures per tree (Pi). Pictures 

were scaled according to a reference (a topographic milestone set next to the tree) in the image 

processing software ImageJ® (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Next, trunk position 

was determined and the tree canopy contour was manually delimited and automatically divided into 

two halves. 

A special program was developed in R software [30] to automatically calculate the surface of both 

of the crown projection halves and their respective volumes, by revolutionizing it around the vertical 

axis and using the Pappus Guldinus’ second theorem. For each picture, the tree volume was calculated 

as the mean of the two generated volumes. The final volume of the tree crown was calculated as the 

mean of all the eight calculated volumes corresponding to the eight pictures (as shown in Figure 4).

2.3. LiDAR Canopy Characterization 

A total of 55 trees randomly distributed on the selected parcels were scanned three times per side 

from the centre of the row, at a constant speed of 1 km·h−1. The LIDAR scanner used in this work was 

a low cost general-purpose model LMS-200 (Sick, Dusseldorf, Germany), with accuracy of ±10 mm 

and 5.2 mrad of divergence in a range up to 8 m, a selectable angular resolution of 1°, 0.5° or 0.25° 

and a scanning angle of 180°. The same device has been used previously [23,31]. It was mounted on a 

mast attached to a tractor and connected to a laptop via serial RS-232 port (as depicted in Figure 5). A 

GPS device AGGPS162 model (Trimble Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with EGNOS 

correction was placed just above the sensor to determine absolute coordinates of the LiDAR points to 

relate the points obtained from each side of the tree. Two fixed references were used to correlate the 

GPS data to the LiDAR data, as described in Llorens et al. [23]. Even though the LiDAR sensor allows a 

maximum 0.25° resolution, speed limitations of the serial port communication meant that 1° resolution 

was chosen for the scans. However, this resolution is adequate for accurate characterisation of the 

canopy [22]. 

LiDAR points and GPS coordinates obtained were processed to georeference each point obtained 

with the laser sensor. The total data files were filtered to discard those outside the crown (Figure 6).

Figure 6. LiDAR cloud points obtained after scanning three contrasting trees on the same 

row. This cloud of points was used to estimate the tree volume. 

A special program developed in R software was used to determine the volume represented by the 

point cloud. For this purpose, the method used by Xu et al. [12] was applied, which consists of 

calculating the crown volume by dividing the whole tree crown into different horizontal slices with the 

same height and aggregating all of its individual volumes. Data were classified into intervals of 0.01 m 

height each and represented on the same plane (Figure 7). The convex hull algorithm [32] was used to 

define a contour with the most external points of each single slice, and its area Ai was then calculated. 

Finally, each area was multiplied for the height interval, giving an individual volume. The sum of 

every individual volume gave the total LiDAR tree crown volume (VL), as expressed in Equation (4): 

= ∆ℎ ×  (4)
where VL is the calculated LiDAR volume in m3; Δh is the height interval (m) and Ai is the area inside 

the contour (m2).

2.4. Statistical Analysis 

The statistical analysis adopted was a linear correlation between all measured and calculated parameters, 

using statistical R-Software with the Agricolae package. The data analysis included not only the  

results obtained by the method, but also the different geometrical parameters measured in order to 

determine any possible relationship with VL, assumed the most reliable and used as a reference volume. 

A Shapiro-Wilk test (p > 0.05) [33,34] and a visual inspection of their histograms, normal Q-Q plots 

and box plots were performed to ensure that the data were normally distributed for all the tree 

structures evaluated. 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Geometrical Parameters of Evaluated Trees 

Table 2 summarises all measured and calculated parameters. Canopies are observed to be large, 

with large trees ranging from 3.91 m in height in intensive plantations, up to 4.58 m in traditional 

culture systems. Such tree heights make crown characterisation difficult even with the LiDAR sensor, 

because the emitter is set to a constant height and thus the laser beam could not reach the upper part of 



Sensors 2015, 15 3680 

 

 

the trees. Nevertheless, this is offset by the high row spacing, which allowed the sensor to be used with 

no data loss. Another important observation was the variability in trunk diameter amongst the 

plantations. Trunk diameter as measured in traditional trees was almost four times the magnitude and 

more variable (higher standard error) than those observed in intensive trees. This makes sense, due to 

the huge variety of different trunk shapes observed in the trees of traditional plantations. 

We observe little variability in all shape parameters, i.e., Ea, Eb, Ec and	 , reaching 10 cm length 
in the most variable case. Relative errors are also small, ranging from 1.36% to 4.80%. This is 

especially true for , due to its characterization of the whole shape of the crown. 

Conversely, a large variability was observed in the estimated volume of various tree types amongst 

the methodologies evaluated. For example, considering VL, it ranges from 24.60 m3 for the intensive to 

98.08 m3 for the traditional orchard, which supposes a four times increment of volume. Volume ranges 

obtained by all other methods were similar in magnitude. Variability within each tree structure was 

lower than 10% of the mean, even though standard errors were greater than 5 m3 in most traditional trees. 

Thus, accuracy of estimated volumes becomes less important with increasing tree volume, especially in 

traditional trees, which have the biggest sizes.

3.2. Comparison between LiDAR and Manual Methods for Tree Volume Estimation 

Normality for all the tree types was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk normality tests and visual 

inspection of their histograms, normal Q-Q plots and box plots. Therefore, data transformations were 

not deemed necessary. LiDAR tree crown volume (VL) was compared with volumes predicted by all 

other methods, as shown in Figure 8. 

The three regression models demonstrate that the methods are in good agreement for the whole 

range of studied volumes (R2 = 0.79, p < 10−3 in all the cases). The Ellipsoid method (R2 = 0.84) 

performs best, in reference to the LiDAR measurements, and may therefore be considered the most 

appropriate method in olive tree volume characterisation after applying a multiplication factor of 1.2, 

according to the regression model (Figure 8). The Tree Silhouette method also fits the data with 

considerable accuracy (R2 = 0.824), and thus it may be a suitable alternative method. The Projected 

Area method demonstrated the lowest correlation (R2 = 0.785) with the LiDAR data. However, this

method showed another important characteristic—the vector representation of the trees in all the eight 

directions identified the differential growth amongst the tree types (Figure 9). This is especially 

evident in traditional trees, where the mean Vertical Projected Area reflects a higher growth in a 

southwest direction.

Projected Area (APA) (left); Ellipsoid Volume (VE) (centre); and Tree Silhouette Volume 

(VTS) (right) for all orchard plantations. Dashed lines represent the 95% confidence 

interval for the mean. 

 

Figure 9. Mean Projected Area for each tree type: (a) Intensive; (b) Adapted Traditional 

and (c) Traditional. Graphical representation of Vertical Projected Area (APA) parameter. 

We also observed that small tree volumes are more comparable with the VL data, such as those in 

the intensive orchard, than for the larger trees belonging to traditional plantations. This could be 

accounted for by the irregularity of the traditional tree shapes, which are more easily measurable and 

characterised by the LiDAR sensor than by manual measurements. Electronic measurement by LiDAR 

easily detects the protruding branches and crown irregularities, which are common in biggest trees, and 

harder to characterise by any of the other proposed methods. In a decreasing order according their 

accuracy for irregularities’ detection, methods can be ordered as: Tree Silhouette Volume, Vertical 

Projected Area, and Ellipsoid Volume. 

Table 3 summarises the R2 values for the correlations between LiDAR tree crown volume (VL) and 

the other evaluated methods for each tree/plantation type. Tightest correlations between single-trunk 

trees, i.e., intensive and adapted traditional trees and LiDAR estimates were observed, whilst Vertical

Projected Area was the best estimator of LiDAR volume (R2 = 0.860) in orchards. Correlations of 

ellipsoid method (VE), and Tree Silhouette method (VTS) with LiDAR data, were very similar  

(R2 = 0.755 and R2 = 0.792, respectively).  

In traditional adapted trees, the Tree Silhouette method presented the highest R2 value for its 

correlation with LiDAR data (R2 = 0.903), whilst the Ellipsoid method was the least correlated  

(R2 = 0.760). The highest R2 values were observed between LiDAR and all of the evaluated methods in 

the adapted crop system.

Finally, small positive determination coefficients were observed between the various measured 

parameters and LiDAR data for traditional tree shapes. As discussed earlier, this may be due to the 

reduction in measurement accuracy in the manual methods for high tree volumes (Figure 9). Even 

though not being very precise, the most accurate method for characterising traditional tree 

measurements among all the studied was found to be the ellipsoid method (R2 = 0.399), with the 

highest probability (p < 0.001) (p < 0.013 for APA and p < 0.007 for VTS). 

3.3. Correlation between LiDAR Volume and Simple Canopy Parameters 

We evaluated the use of various parameters used to calculate tree volume or area with LiDAR 

volume estimates, in order to simplify the field measurement methodology. Correlations of individual 

parameters with LiDAR volume are shown in Table 4. All measured parameters, except for the  

parameter, are weakly positively correlated with LiDAR volumes (p < 0.01). They are especially low 

for the Projected Area, Ellipsoid, and Tree Silhouette methods. 

Only  in the Projected Area method is strongly correlated with LiDAR volume (R2 = 0.903)  

(Table 4). Comparing this value with those obtained for the studied methods, it is found to be higher 

(highest R2 value was 0.843 for ellipsoid method, Figure 8). This is an important observation, as  

parameter calculation is a relatively simple and quick method that could be adopted by farmers or 

technicians without specialist training, in comparison with other methods such as electronic equipment 

is needed. 

The  parameter correlates well with LiDAR volume across all plantation types, as shown in  

Figure 10. For example, determination coefficients are particularly high in intensive (R2 = 0.863) and 

adapted trees (R2 = 0.866). These coefficients of determination were as good as those obtained with the 

studied methods for these systems (Table 3). The most significant result was the coefficient of 

determination for traditional trees (R2 = 0.612), which was much higher than those similarly observed

using the ellipsoid, tree silhouette and projected area methods. Thus,  provides much more accurate 

estimations of crown volume than all other evaluated methods.

Figure 10. Correlations between  and LiDAR volume for (a) All studied trees;  

(b) Intensive trees; (c) Adapted traditional trees; (d) Traditional trees. 

As to the relationships between each two of all the measured and calculated parameters, obtained 

correlations indicate proportionality in the trees’ geometrical characteristics. Positive correlations are 

observed between HT and  (R2 = 0.450; p < 0.01) that leads to a relationship between crown width 

and height. Positive correlations are further observed between TD and  (R2 = 0.403; p < 0.01),

semi axes Eb (R2 = 0.338; p < 0.01), and Ec (R2 = 0.413; p < 0.01). However, it must be underlined the 

low value of those correlations, which could suggest a certain dispersion of the values. 

4. Conclusions 

Three methodologies for measuring tree crown volumes were compared with those obtained with  

a 2D-LiDAR laser scanner in three types of olive tree plantations. The following conclusions can  

be drawn: 

• All the evaluated methods were able to estimate the tree crown volume with a relatively high 
degree of accuracy. The best predictions were obtained with the Ellipsoid Volume 

measurement method, followed by the Tree Silhouette method and the Vertical Projected  

Area method. 

• Correlations were not as good as those found in other three-dimensional crops due to the 
irregularity in the crown shapes. Determination coefficients were highest amongst low tree 

volumes, and weakest for high tree volumes. 

• Vertical Projected Area method was the most accurate for intensive orchards, whilst the Tree 
Silhouette and Ellipsoid Volume method yielded the most accurate estimates of tree volume in 

adapted traditional orchards and traditional orchards, respectively. In traditional orchards, the 

coefficient of determination was much lower than in the adapted trees. 

• Statistical analysis carried out demonstrated that all of the evaluated methods were able to 
estimate the crown volume in olive tree plantations, though new methodologies could be 

selected to achieve high accuracy. 

• Study of different shape parameters showed that all the evaluated tree shapes have certain 
relationships between their basic dimensions, even though they are not very marked. This fact 

was mainly observed between tree height and crown width. 

• Among all the parameters measured or calculated in this study, the Mean Vector used for the 
Vertical Projected Area method gave the best correlations amongst all trees in total, and for each 

individual tree shape. For traditional olive trees, the correlation of this parameter with the crown 

volume was much higher than those obtained with the other evaluated methods, but it is 

interesting to remark that the accuracy of the prediction is not as good as in the other crop 

types. In addition, the mean vector method seems to be a simple and quick procedure for canopy 

characterization, and requires no specialist training to be adopted. Therefore, it has been found to 

be the one of the most useful methods for estimating tree volume in traditional olive tree 

plantations. Nevertheless, its accuracy limitations should be considered. 

• In general, whilst electronic LiDAR measurements was found to be the most accurate and 
reliable amongst all evaluated methods, alternative user-friendly methods (such as 

measurement of the  parameter) could be proposed to characterize tree crown volume and 

dimensions (i.e., shape). However, LiDAR measurement should not be considered as a perfect 

method. Problems linked to the measurement process itself [35] and collateral errors produced 

by GPS measurements [23] should be evaluated.
