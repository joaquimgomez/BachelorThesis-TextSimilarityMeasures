Abstract

BACKGROUND: Hand-held-trolley sprayers have recently been promoted to improve spray application techniques in green-
houses in south-eastern Spain. However, certain aspects remain to be improved. A modified hand-held-trolley sprayer was
evaluated under two different canopy conditions (high and low canopy density) and with several sprayer settings (nozzle type,
air assistance and spray volume). In this study, the deposition, coverage and uniformity of distribution of the spray on the canopy
have been assessed.

RESULTS: The deposition on leaves was significantly higher when flat-fan nozzles and air assistance were used at both high and
low spray volumes. No differences were detected between the reference system at a high spray volume and the modified trolley
at a low spray volume. Flat-fan nozzles with air assistance increased penetrability into the canopy.

CONCLUSIONS: Air assistance and flat-fan nozzles allow volume rates to be reduced while maintaining or improving spray quality
distribution. The working parameters of hand-held sprayers must be considered to reduce environmental risk and increase the
efficacy of the spraying process.

1 INTRODUCTION
Producing high-quality food in a safer manner is one of the
most important objectives in modern agriculture. This is especially
important in intensive horticultural production, where the agricul-
ture and food industry is seeking to produce high-quality foods
by safe and sustainable procedures.1 Fresh vegetable production
represents one of the most important agricultural businesses in
southern Europe in general and in the south of Spain in particu-
lar, with many unsolved problems related to the lack of mechani-
sation, intensive use of plant protection products (PPPs)2,3 and in
some cases undesirable episodes related to the residues on food.4

According to Eurostat statistics (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa
.eu), the area devoted to protected crop cultivation in the Euro-
pean Community member states (MSs) is roughly 150 000 ha. The
countries with the highest areas under protected cultivation are
Spain (66 000 ha), Italy (34 600 ha), France (11 400 ha), the Nether-
lands (10 200 ha), Poland (6300 ha) and Greece (4900 ha).5

One of the greatest risk factors affecting the economic, environ-
mental and productive parameters in covered horticulture pro-
duction is directly related to the use of PPPs during pest/disease
control. Aspects of operator safety, residues on the produced
food, environmental contamination and economic investment
are problems linked to this specific and necessary labour; most
of these are directly linked to the technology used during the
process.6 – 13

Hand-held spray guns and lances are the most widely used
methods of crop protection in greenhouses, in spite of the heavy
workload and high risk of operator exposure associated with
these techniques.14 These spray application techniques have also
proved to be less effective than spray boom equipment under
many conditions.15 Hand-held spraying techniques are less expen-
sive; however, they are less specific in practical use. Many growers
also erroneously believe that high spray volumes and pressures
are needed to assure good plant protection,16,17 achieving in
some cases values of over 4000 L ha−1.18,19 Given the high number
of treatments per year, this constitutes a great risk of contami-
nation and a considerable economic factor that deserves to be
considered.

For these reasons, several improvements and new developments
have appeared in the last 10 years with the aim of improving the
spray application technology for use in greenhouses. The devel-
opments range from newly designed hand-held trolleys equipped

with vertical booms, either with or without air assistance,3,15,18

to the most sophisticated and expensive self-propelled and
autonomous vehicles.19 – 22 The advantages of using vertical
boom sprayers compared with using hand-held sprayers or lances
have been widely reported12,15,23 – 25 in terms of coverage and
uniformity of spray distribution. Self-propelled and autonomous
sprayers have also attracted interest because of reduced oper-
ator exposure,19,26,27 improved work capacity19,22 and in some
cases reduced application of PPPs while maintaining the efficacy
of pest/disease control.28,29 However, problems have also been
reported: poor penetration capacity exhibited by vertical boom
sprayers without air assistance;28,30 management of hand-held
trolleys depending on the soil type and sprayer design; difficulties
of identifying accurate conditions for safe and efficient use of
self-propelled sprayers, including aspects related to the high level
of investment required.16

The objective of this study was to improve the spray application
process in Spanish greenhouses by modifying and improving
an existing spray technology. A commercial hand-held-trolley
sprayer (Carretillas Amate, Almería, Spain) was selected, and its
technical characteristics (incorporation of air assistance, different
nozzle types, nozzle distance reduced from 50 to 30 cm, operation
system) were modified. The modified sprayer was then compared
with the original reference sprayer in two different tomato crop
(Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Velasco) greenhouses in El Ejido
(Almería, south of Spain). The specific objectives of this work were:
(a) to evaluate the effects of air assistance on spray distribution
quality; (b) to determine the most suitable nozzle type and nozzle
distribution along the boom; (c) to quantify the influence of
canopy characteristics on the spray distribution quality; (d) to
analyse the effect of applied spray volume on the efficiency of
spray distribution quality and leaf deposition.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Sprayers tested and working conditions
Two types of spraying equipment (a reference sprayer and a modi-
fied sprayer) with two nozzle spray types (flat-fan and hollow-cone
nozzles) and an optional air assistance system were tested in two
different greenhouses (high and low canopy densities of 2.98
and 1.4 m2 m−3 respectively) at two different application volumes
(600 and 1000 L ha−1). The technical specifications of the trials are
shown in Table 1.

The reference spraying equipment was equipped with two ver-
tical spray booms 1.5 m long with four nozzles per side (0.5 m
between nozzles), mounted on a manually pulled trolley (Carretil-
las Amate, Viator, Spain).

On the modified sprayer, the spray booms were replaced with
two new stainless steel profiles where six nozzles per side were
mounted, resulting in an internozzle distance of 0.30 m. The total
height of the modified boom was 1.8 m. Additionally, an air assis-
tance system was added, with six individual and adjustable out-
puts per side, each corresponding to a nozzle; each outlet was
placed after its corresponding nozzle according to the spraying
direction. An electrical blower (B&D 3000 W; Stanley Black and
Decker, New Britain, CT) was installed in the central part of the
trolley. A plastic box of 0.037 m3 (0.5× 0.25× 0.30 m) was placed
in the trolley to collect the air generated by the blower and dis-
tribute it among the individual outlets. Twelve individual flexible
plastic pipes were connected to the air distribution box, and air
flow was conducted to every nozzle. The modified sprayer was
converted into a hydropneumatic sprayer with an air assistance
system of ca 13 m s−1 measured at each output. Six individual out-
lets (only one side) of 0.0015 m2 section (total air outlet section
0.009 m2) were placed along the boom, giving a total air flow rate
of 435.24 m3 h−1. The highest air speed (14.7 m s−1) was measured
in output 4 placed 1.0 m over the ground. The lowest air speed

Handhand-held trolley air assisted sprayer to improve greenhouses’ spray application www.soci.org

Figure 1. Reference hand-held-trolley sprayer (left) and modified sprayer
with air assistance (right).

(12.0 m s−1) was detected at the highest output placed 1.8 m over
the ground. Great uniformity among air velocities was observed
(5.8% CV). Figure 1 shows the details of the two evaluated sprayers.

The two sprayers were tested with two different spray appli-
cation volumes: 600 and 1000 L ha−1. The high volume was first
established following standard application practices according to
the canopy characteristics. The low volume was then established
by a 40% reduction on the basis of best results from previous prac-
tical experience in greenhouses (Syngenta, unpublished data).

The intended calibration of the sprayer for accomplishing the
volume application rate was performed by establishing a fixed
forward speed and selecting the appropriate nozzle size and
pressure according to the required flow rate. However, the actual
spray volume was calculated according to the real forward speed,
row spacing and flow rate.

The working conditions for the reference sprayer were chosen
following the recommendations of the Spanish Plant Protection
Assessment Organisation.17 An extended-range flat-fan nozzle XR
110 (Spraying Systems Co., TeeJet Technologies, IL) was used at
high pressure (13.0 bar).

The modified sprayer was tested with two different nozzle types:
extended-range flat-fan (XR 110) nozzles and hollow-cone (ATR)
nozzles (80∘) (Albuz-CoorsTek, Evereux, France). In this case, the
working pressure was adjusted according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations to obtain the intended volume rate. For all
trials, the forward speed was measured and adjusted to remain
as constant as possible around 3 km h−1. This value was obtained
after several previous tests made in order to find a comfortable
forward speed for the operator.

Note that all trials with the modified sprayer were conducted
with and without air assistance, except in the case of hollow-cone
nozzles, which were only tested with air assistance according to
their recommended use.11,24 The trial settings are summarised
in Table 1. Both sprayers were connected via a 30 m long hose
(0.025 m diameter) to a hand-held wheelbarrow with a tank capac-
ity of 100 L, and a piston pump (37 L min−1) and a petrol engine
(3.5 kWA) (Honda, Slough, UK) were used for feeding the sprayers.
This procedure simplified the feeding process with a more precise
tank concentration while avoiding the difficulties of connecting
the sprayers to the greenhouse installation.

To quantify the leaf deposit and coverage at different parts of
the canopy, a fluorescent tracer (Helios SC 500; Syngenta Crop
Protection AG, Basel, Switzerland) was used at 0.1% v/v. The

calculated amount of tracer was added to the external tank and

2.2 Canopy characterisation
Field tests were carried out at El Ejido (Almería, south-eastern
Spain) on a representative commercial tomato (Solanum lycoper-
sicum L. cv. Velasco) production system (plastic greenhouse) of this
zone. The two sprayers were tested in two different greenhouses,
each with different canopy characteristics. Greenhouse 1 had a
plantation pattern of 0.4 m between plants and a row spacing of
2.5 m (2 plants m−2) in a twin-row system (two rows growing close
together and separated by 0.4 m). The greenhouse had a typical
configuration for south-eastern Spain, consisting of a main corri-
dor and several aisles coming from this corridor. The average aisle
length was 30 m.

Greenhouse 2 had a plantation pattern of 0.4 m between plants
and a row spacing of 2.8 m (1.8 plants m−2) in a twin-row system
with 0.3 m separation. This greenhouse had the same configura-
tion as greenhouse 1 (30 m).

In both cases, the canopy was completely characterised. Geo-
metric parameters (canopy height, canopy width) and derived
parameters (leaf wall area,31 tree row volume32 – 34 and leaf
area density35,36) were calculated after the field measurements
(Table 2). For leaf area measurements, four plants were randomly
selected along the row. The leaf area and the corresponding
leaf area index were determined by estimating the area/weight
ratio.37 – 39 The total weight of each plant (only leaves) was mea-
sured in the laboratory immediately after cutting it, and an 80 g
sample of tomato leaflets picked randomly was measured with
a LI-COR LI 3100C electronic planimeter (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).
Equations (1) and (2) indicate the area/weight ratios obtained for
greenhouses 1 and 2 respectively:

A = 1.9502 · g + 0.0095 (1)

A = 1.5613 · g + 0.0084 (2)

where A is the leaf surface (m2) and g is the leaf weight (g).

2.3 Layout of trials in greenhouses
Different rows of tomato plants were strategically selected in each
greenhouse to avoid cross-spraying between the different tests,
leaving a boundary zone for this purpose. For every test, one

complete row was sprayed from both sides, following the normal
procedure concerning the direction during two-sided sprayings
(Fig. 2). The trials were arranged to maintain practical management
of both tests and sprayer equipment.

Sampling zones were defined by the height (top, middle and
bottom) and depth (peripheral edge and centre or internal edge)
of the canopy. In total, six different positions were distinguished.
For each zone, ten samples composed of five tomato leaflets each
were collected after the spraying process, placed into hermetically
sealed plastic bags, and stored until analysis in the laboratory.
Samples were randomly collected along the canopy row.

Environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity)
during the trials were recorded. For greenhouse 1, temperature
ranged from 14.4 to 19.5 ∘C, and relative humidity (RH) from 55 to
83.9%. For greenhouse 2, temperature ranged from 16.0 to 22.0 ∘C,
and RH from 55.0 to 60.0%.

2.4 Procedure for spray distribution evaluation
The spray distribution was evaluated by analysing three parame-
ters: (1) spray deposit on leaves, expressed by the amount of tracer
per unit leaf area (ng cm−2); (2) spray coverage, which represents
the percentage of leaf surface covered by the fluorescent tracer
used as the active ingredient; (3) penetration index (PI), which
enables the spray deposit measured in the external parts of the
canopy to be compared with that in the internal part.

Immediately after the collection, all the samples were weighed
individually, and the data were transformed to leaf area per bag
(cm2 of leaf surface per sample) by applying the previously deter-
mined surface-weight factor. This value together with the tracer
concentration made it possible to determine the deposition per
unit leaf surface. Samples were then washed by adding 200 mL
of diethylenglycol-monoethylether solution into each plastic bag
and shaking every sample for 20 s. A liquid sample from each plas-
tic bag was poured through a filter paper into a test tube for flu-
orescence measurements. Tracer concentration was determined
using the fluorimetry technique at an excitation wavelength of

375 nm and a measurement wavelength of 435 nm (Fluorimeter
96; Syngenta).

Tank samples were collected directly from the nozzle prior to and
after the spraying of each individual trial to measure the tracer
concentration in the tank. The results were normalised to ng cm−2

leaf/g ha−1 ground, depending on the concentration, following the
procedure of Gil et al.,38 according to the equation

dn =
d · 105

V · Tcs
(3)

where dn is the normalised tracer deposit rate per unit leaf surface
(ng cm−2), d is the actual deposit per unit of leaf surface (ng cm−2),
V is the spray volume dose (L ha−1) and T cs is the tracer concentra-
tion of the spray mixture in the tank (mg L−1).

The degrees of leaf coverage on the upper and lower sides
were also measured. Sample leaves collected on each trial at each
position were photographed using ultraviolet light with a Canon
450D camera (Canon Europa NV, Amstelveen, The Netherlands).
The obtained pictures (Fig. 3) were evaluated with FluorSoft, a
software program dedicated to image analysis (Syngenta image
analysis). The results were expressed as the percentage of the leaf
surface covered by the tracer in relation to the total leaf surface.
This procedure was executed for both sides of the leaves to obtain
separate coverage information for the upper and lower sides of the
leaves.

PI (%) was defined in order to analyse the relative deposition
between the internal and external parts of the canopy according
to the equation

PI = 1
E
· 100 (4)

where I and E are the average coverages at the internal and
external parts of the canopy respectively.

Parameter E was calculated by taking into consideration the
deposition levels measured at the two external parts of the canopy,
because the sprayer circulation was arranged to spray the canopy
completely from both sides.

2.5 Data analysis
The effects of the different parameters evaluated (application vol-
ume, nozzle type, canopy density, nozzle distance, air assistance,
sample position) on spray deposition and spray coverage were
examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the treatment as a
source of variation, followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls post
hoc test.

Prior to statistical analysis, the data were transformed (square
root for deposition data and arcsine for coverage data) to
homogenise variances.40 In addition, residual analyses were
also performed. All statistical analyses were performed with R
software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2012).

3 RESULTS
An overview of the data collected shows the influence of the
canopy and spray volume on the deposition and coverage on the
leaves (Table 3). A significantly high deposition level was obtained
in the greenhouse with a low canopy density and a high volume
rate; conversely, the opposite was observed with a high canopy
density and a low application rate. Coverage was also affected by
canopy characteristics, and the combination of low canopy density
and low application rate yielded the lowest average coverage on
both sides of the leaves.

Considering leaf deposition and coverage as principal factors
for evaluating spray quality, Figs 4 and 5 show the average lev-
els of deposition and coverage, respectively, obtained for all tests,
canopy characteristics and applied volume rates. Significant differ-
ences were found between tests, with the combination of flat-fan
nozzles and air assistance yielding the highest deposition lev-
els. In general, flat-fan nozzles yielded higher levels of deposition
than hollow-cone nozzles, irrespective of other parameters. The
effects of nozzle type and air assistance were unclear in terms
of coverage. However, coverage levels tended to increase with
hollow-cone nozzles. Importantly, the influence of canopy charac-
teristics on coverage was notable, resulting in the highest levels on

analysis of the results, with a particular focus on canopy char-
acteristics, following the same procedure carried out in previous
studies.29,41

3.1 High-canopy-density greenhouse
3.1.1 Spray deposition
Table 4 shows the results of average deposition and coverage
for each test in the case of a high canopy density. For each
value, the uniformity in the whole canopy volume was measured
by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) in every case.
Deposition levels show significant differences among treatments,
with tests T2 and T4 (flat-fan nozzles with air assistance) yielding
the highest values. In contrast, the same nozzles without air
assistance and the reference sprayer yielded the poorest results in
terms of coverage. Notably, the lowest CV values, indicative of the
most uniform deposition for the whole canopy, were also obtained
in tests T2 and T4. This effect was opposite to that found in the
case of hollow-cone nozzles, indicating great variability among the
different sampling zones in the canopy.

A detailed analysis of coverage levels indicates no significant
differences (P < 0.05) among treatments. Interestingly, however,
a tendency for coverage levels to decrease was observed when

Figure 4. Average deposition levels on leaves for all tests. Black series corresponds to 1000 L ha−1 without air assistance, black-striped series corresponds
to 1000 L ha−1 with air assistance, grey series corresponds to 600 L ha−1 without air assistance and grey-striped series corresponds to 600 L ha−1 with air

canopy density was reduced. Considering the volume application
rate, flat-fan nozzles with air assistance generated the best results
in terms of deposition, with no significant differences relative to
the reference test (T7). The same combination of nozzle and air
assistance also yielded the best results in terms of deposition in
the case of a low application rate, albeit with significant differences
compared with the rest of treatments. In this case, the lowest
deposition levels were obtained in the reference test (T8).

Figure 6 shows the levels of leaf deposition obtained in every
sample zone of the canopy, arranged separately by test and
volume rate. Application of 1000 L ha−1 led to spray deposition
on the external part of the canopy becoming highest at medium
height in all treatments, with the top centre position of the
canopy being the most difficult area to spray. This tendency
was similarly maintained at 600 L ha−1, except in the case of
hollow-cone nozzles with air assistance, where the deposition
in different canopy zones was highly uniform. Interestingly, low
deposition levels were obtained in all cases on the internal part
of the canopy, especially on the highest part of the crop profile.
In general, no run-off episodes were detected visually at the two
spray volumes selected.

3.1.2 Leaf coverage
Figure 7 shows the coverage levels on different parts of the
canopy and sides of the leaves, generated after the image analysis
procedure developed for this experiment. The results indicate a
similar pattern among the tests, regardless of the spray volume
applied. In all cases, coverage levels for the upper sides of leaves
were higher than those for their undersides, on both the external
and internal parts of the canopy. The lowest coverage levels were
always obtained on the undersides of the leaves located in the
internal part of the canopy. In general, the combination of low
coverage levels on the internal part of the canopy and on the

undersides of the external leaves led to a reduction in average
coverage for the low spray volume rate (Table 3).

3.1.3 Spray penetration into the canopy
The PI was defined and calculated with the aim of evaluating the
amount of product that arrives at the internal part of the canopy in
relation to the amount of product deposited in the external zones
of the crop (Fig. 8). At a high spray volume (1000 L ha−1), the joint
effect of air assistance and flat-fan nozzles increased penetration
capability, with PI values near 60%. In contrast, hollow-cone noz-
zles yielded the worst results in terms of penetration. The high-
est PI values obtained with the reference sprayer (T7) could be
related to the excessive working pressure (13 bar), which differed
substantially from the recommended values for this type of nozzle.
In the case of a low spray volume (600 L ha−1), the highest PI was
obtained with hollow-cone nozzles (56.2%), always with air assis-
tance, owing to the high deposition levels measured in the internal
part of the canopy. This result agrees exceptionally well with the
deposition obtained in other sampling zones in the internal part
of the canopy. Similar PI values were obtained with the reference
sprayer technology (T8) and with the combination of flat-fan noz-
zles and air assistance (T4).

3.2 Low-canopy-density greenhouse
3.2.1 Spray deposition
An overall analysis of the obtained results in the case of low canopy
density also reveals significant differences (P < 0.05) among treat-
ments, both in terms of deposition and leaf coverage (Table 5). As
observed in the case of high canopy density, the combination of
air assistance and flat-fan nozzles (T10) yielded the highest depo-
sition levels and the lowest CV values. Hollow-cone nozzles at both
spray volume rates (T13 and T14) yielded the lowest levels of leaf
deposition.

a Values followed by the same letter (in columns) indicate no significant difference.

A detailed analysis of the liquid distribution among the canopy
sampling zones (Fig. 9) indicates diverse behaviour between treat-
ments, depending on the spray volume. Whereas most treatments
at a higher spray volume generated higher deposition levels on the
external (rather than internal) part of the canopy, treatment with
flat-fan nozzles and air assistance yielded no differences among
canopy zones. For a low spray volume, no tests yielded significant
differences (P < 0.05) among canopy zones, except at the top inter-
nal position where the zone was the most difficult to cover. Once
again, flat-fan nozzles without air assistance yielded the poorest
deposition results in the internal part of the canopy.

3.2.2 Leaf coverage
An overall evaluation of the leaf coverage results at a low
canopy density shows no significant differences within treat-
ments, either at high or low spray volumes (Table 5). A separate

analysis by leaf side and canopy position shows a similar distri-
bution, regardless of the spray volume (Fig. 10), with generally
less coverage in the case of 600 L ha−1. Relative differences
between the upper- and lower-side leaf zones were similar in
all tests, regardless of the canopy sampling zone and spray
volume rate.

3.2.3 Spray penetration into the canopy
The PI was also calculated separately according to the spray
volume (Fig. 11). In both cases, flat-fan nozzles with air assis-
tance yielded the highest PI values, with the value obtained at
1000 L ha−1 (70% penetration) being the highest among all tests.
This value confirms reports on evaluating the distribution across
the canopy. Similar PI values were found for the rest of the treat-
ments. This behaviour was repeated in the case of a low spray
volume.

4 DISCUSSION
The research carried out here shows the important effects of
canopy density, spray application rate and working parameters
(mainly regarding nozzle settings and air assistance) on the final
quality of spray distribution on tomato plants in greenhouses. In
general, the highest leaf deposit levels are obtained at low canopy
densities. This tendency is reversed in the case of leaf coverage,
where a tendency for coverage to decrease is observed in the case
of low canopy densities.

Air assistance has been demonstrated to be an interesting tool to
improve the quality of spray application. In general, all treatments
with air assistance yielded better results in terms of deposition in
the internal canopy zones. However, no benefit was observed at
the canopy periphery, a zone easily exposed to application. This
trend was demonstrated at the two evaluated canopy densities,
regardless of the spray application rate. This is especially marked
in the case of flat-fan nozzles, with PI values ranging from 52.6
to 70.3%. Exceptionally, hollow-cone nozzles with air assistance
yielded the highest PI value (52.6%) when a low spray volume was
applied at a high canopy density. These results are in concordance
with Foqué et al.,14 who reported a high effect of joint air support
and flat-fan nozzles. Derksen et al.42 concluded that air assistance

of 20 m s−1 in spray trials in bell peppers provided no advantage
in the amount of spray retained on the foliage, but it produced
more desirable spray quality on foliage and resulted in more
spray retained on the whole fruit. PI values of treatments with air
assistance were higher than those obtained without air assistance.
In this last case, PI values ranged from 26.1 to 50%; this indicates
that in some part of the canopy the spray liquid retained by the
leaves was only a quarter of the total deposited in the external part
of the canopy. This fact directly relates to the efficacy of applying a
certain spray, in terms of pest/disease control, as already reported
by Sánchez-Hermosilla et al.16

The highest coverage levels obtained with air assistance, espe-
cially on the undersides of the leaves, agreed with the results of
Lee et al.,18 who concluded that a sprayer equipped with flat-fan
nozzles and air assistance improves the deposits on the upper and
lower surfaces. Given the low canopy density, no clear effect of air
assistance was found.

No clear effect of nozzle type was detected in the case of high
canopy density. In contrast, tests carried out at low canopy den-
sity revealed a tendency for deposition to increase when flat-fan
nozzles and air assistance were selected, yielding results supe-
rior to those obtained with hollow-cone nozzles. Considering
the ability to penetrate into the internal parts of the canopy,

hollow-cone nozzles with air support yielded low deposition lev-
els in the canopy. These results are in line with those reported
by Foqué et al.,14 who found similar results for spray application
to laurel crop. This fact may be explained by the results reported
in previous studies, which stated that the small droplet gener-
ated by hollow-cone nozzles produced initial momentum dissi-
pation and, as a consequence, a reduction in kinetic energy.3

Braekman et al.12 and Foqué et al.43 postulated that a coarse spray
had higher momentum and therefore greater capacity to pene-
trate the canopy. Together with other important factors such as
air assistance, this can explain why flat-fan nozzles at low pres-
sure generally yield the highest deposition levels. These results
also demonstrate the important influence of canopy characteris-
tics (crop height and width) and air assistance in leaf deposition.

Other parameters, such as distance between nozzles and canopy,
nozzle angling or spray direction, can affect the coverage inside
the plants. A spray distance of 30 cm to the stem proved to be
more effective when spraying conically shaped plants in a bay
laurel crop.43 Regarding nozzle angling, different results were
obtained concerning its influence on deposition and coverage.
Foqué et al.43 concluded that angling the spray did not result in
a higher deposition or penetration capacity compared with the
standard vertical spray boom. However, later research carried out
by the same authors30 found a positive trend from using a forward
spray angle.

In relation to leaf coverage, the results demonstrated that the
differences among tests were lowest when the canopy density
was highest. In contrast, in the case of low canopy density, the
effect of spray application rate was greater than that of nozzle
type. However, regardless of canopy density and spray application
volume, similar results of coverage on both sides of the leaves
were observed in all zones of the canopy. This suggests that the
main factor affecting deposition and coverage is the presence of
air assistance.

The average leaf deposition levels obtained at a low canopy
density were higher than those obtained at a high canopy den-
sity. Moreover, clear differences in average deposition were shown
between external and internal parts of the canopy. The sample
height zone (top, middle and bottom) has been identified as an
influential factor on spray distribution into the canopy. These
results agree with those of Derksen et al.,25 who reported that
spray canopy position is also a significant factor for foliar deposi-
tion with artificial targets.

Generally, important differences between leaf coverage for the
different parts of the leaf (upper and lower sides) were observed
in all evaluated tests. These results were expected and agree with
those obtained by Lee et al.18 and Sánchez-Hermosilla et al.15 The
highest coverage levels were always found on the upper sides of
the leaves in an external part of the canopy.

Handhand-held trolley air assisted sprayer to improve greenhouses’ spray application www.soci.org

By considering the effect of applied volume rate on the quality
of spray distribution, the sprayer settings were observed to have
an influence far greater than that of the volume application rate.
There were no clear benefits from increasing the water volume
rate. The results are in accordance with the conclusions reported
by Sánchez-Hermosilla et al.16 Notably, air assistance configura-
tions allowed a reduction in the volume application rate without
significant differences at either canopy density.
