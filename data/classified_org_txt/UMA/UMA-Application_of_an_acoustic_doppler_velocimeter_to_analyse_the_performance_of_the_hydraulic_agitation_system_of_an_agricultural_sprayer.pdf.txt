Abstract: An acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) was used to analyse the impact of an agricultural
sprayer’s agitation system settings on fluid velocities inside the tank. A 3000 L capacity sprayer
equipped with a 4-nozzle hydraulic agitation system was used. ADV measurements were carried at
32 points inside the tank under the following settings: circuit pressures of 8, 10, or 12 bar; water level
in the tank of 1000, 2000, or 3000 L; 2 or 4 active nozzles. An agitation test with a concentration of
0.4% copper oxychloride was employed to analyse the concentration of active matter as a function of
tank fill level and number of active nozzles. All parameters significantly affected the fluid velocity,
which increased with increasing pressure, but decreased with increasing water level in the tank and an
increased number of active nozzles. Concentration tests showed greater active matter concentrations
when higher velocities were recorded by the ADV. The ADV was shown to be a useful tool for the
rapid assessment of fluid velocities; in the future, it could be used to validate the design of agitation
systems, and to estimate their capacity to ensure an adequate level of active matter concentration in
the fluid.

1. Introduction

Air-assisted sprayers used in fruit orchards are designed to distribute a uniform dose of pesticide
over the entire canopy. Many researchers have studied the influence of the main working parameters
on treatment performance, including air flow, fluid pressure, nozzle type, volume of vegetation,
forward velocity, etc. To date, the analysis of these parameters has assumed that the concentration of
active matter in the tank is uniform. To guarantee this uniformity, tanks of agricultural sprayers are
normally equipped with hydraulic agitation systems.

These systems consist of one or several nozzles (jet agitation systems) which, working at a specific
pressure, introduce a flow rate into the tank, generating turbulent flow. The mixing quality depends on
different factors, including the geometry of the tank, the quantity of water in the tank, nozzle locations,
nozzle flow rates, system pressure, and the time available for mixing.

Currently, the experimental procedures used for evaluating the mixing quality of the agitation
systems in new agricultural sprayer tanks are based on the standard ISO 5682-2 [1,2], which specifies
the methods of testing and assessing the performance of agitation systems in hydraulic sprayers.
This standard requires, after a fixed mixing time, sampling from several locations to measure

the concentration of active matter. For the case of sprayers in use, ISO 16122 [3] requires only a
visual assessment.

Alternative methods to evaluate the performance of agitation systems have been considered by
different studies [4] and fall under two different approaches: the assessment of liquid turbulence inside
the tank using three electronic flow meters and measurement of the concentration of a solid tracer (glass
microspheres) mixed in the water. [5] used digital images taken through a transparent tank to analyse
the deposition of particles from a suspension of copper oxychloride. In other investigations [6–8],
several commercial turbidity meters have been tested for potential use in determining mixing efficiency
by measuring the concentration of solids in the liquid.

The study of agitation systems should allow for analysing the effect of set variables (pressure,
number of nozzles, nozzle flow, nozzle position, liquid level in the tank) on the concentration of
active material in the sample. Performing this type of study according to the ISO 5682-2 standard,
for different pressure configurations, nozzle types, etc., would be prohibitively expensive and time
consuming; instead, equipment manufacturers require rapid measurement methods that can validate
the modelling carried out in the design phase. An ideal experimental test method would be one that
provides information to allow manufacturers to quantify the same parameters used by engineers in the
design phase, which in most cases are the estimated flow velocity at different points of the sprayer tank
by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). For this purpose, different studies have investigated
fluid velocities inside spray tanks using CFD, and these values have been validated by experimental
measures [9–11]. As an additional step in this line of work, some researchers [12] CFD modelled the
movement of fluid in the 4000 L tank of an agricultural sprayer and attempted to correlate the velocity
of the fluid with the concentration of active matter, obtaining inconclusive results.

Fluid velocities inside the tank provide useful information regarding the operation of the agitation
system, and there are different technologies available for velocity measurements, including: particle
image velocimeters [13], laser Doppler velocimeters [11], hot-film anemometers [10], acoustic Doppler
velocimeters (ADV) [14], electromagnetic current meters [15], and electronic flow meters [4]. In most
cases, acoustic Doppler velocimetry has been the preferred method [13,16,17] because it is relatively low
cost, can record at a relatively high frequency (up to 100 Hertz (Hz)), can measure three dimensional
instantaneous velocity measurements, and is non-intrusive because it has a relatively small sampling
volume according to the instrument selected. Furthermore, calibration is invariant [15].

ADVs are commonly used for fluid flow characterization and for the determination of suspended
solids and turbulence [14]; they have been used in a habitual way for the measurement of velocities
in river beds, lakes, and natural water environments [18]. ADVs operate on the principle of Doppler
shift. Two acoustic pulses of different duration are transmitted, separated by a time interval, and the
energy backscattered by particulate matter in a sampling volume at a short distance from the probe
tip is recorded after each pulse. The velocity is then calculated as a function of the phase lag between
the return signals [19]. ADV measurements are contaminated by Doppler-instrument noise [13], or by
spikes, which are random outliers that can occur owing to interference of previous pulses reflected
from the flow boundaries or due to the presence of bubbles, sediments, etc. in the flow [20]. Therefore,
the signal must be carefully analysed and, if necessary, data cleaning techniques applied to ensure
signal quality. Nonetheless, research conducted working with ADV velocimeters [21], stated that mean
flow measurements may be reliably obtained less than 10 mm from the fluid boundaries.

The use of a three-dimensional velocity measuring device inside the tank of an agricultural
sprayer under different working conditions (pressure, number of nozzles, position of nozzles, etc.)
would make it possible to know the effect of the regulation parameters on the operation of the system
and, in this way, estimate the efficiency of the agitation system on the basis of these conditioning factors.
Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the applicability of using an ADV to investigate
the operation and efficiency of a hydraulic agitation system in the tank of an agricultural sprayer
according to different working parameters.

was quantified for 30 s at different working pressures (8, 10 and 12 bar). Subsequently, the rest of the
nozzles were tested in a similar way to the pressure of 10 bar to check that the nominal flow did not
show variations between nozzles.

2.4. Fluid Velocity Measurements 

An experimental factorial design was carried out with 3 independent variables for the 
configuration of the agitation system: water level in the tank (1000, 2000, or 3000 L); number of active 
nozzles (2 or 4); and working pressure of the agitation circuit (8, 10, or 12 bar). 

Velocity measurements were made in four circular sections of the tank, with eight measuring 
points in each section distributed at three heights (Figure 4), and working with water inside the tank. 
These measurements were carried out considering the different combinations of the variables 
(pressure, number of nozzles and tank filling level). In this way, Table 3 reflects the measurements 
made for the different variable configurations. When the system worked with two nozzles, these were 
on opposite sides of the tank.

Velocity measurements were taken using the ADV at a frequency of 50 Hz. The agitation system 
was configured in terms of working pressure, number of nozzles activated, and water level in the 
tank. A mechanical implement specifically designed to position the ADV at the different measuring 
points was used. Sections 1 and 2 of the tank were accessed from the front filler neck and Sections 3 
and 4 from the rear filler neck (Figure 4). The tank was first filled to the required water level. 
Subsequently, the ADV was placed at its measuring point. Finally, the parameters of pressure and 
number of nozzles were established, and the agitation system was left working for 3 min to achieve 
stabilization of fluid flow. After fluid flow was stabilized, data were collected for 20 s at each 
measuring point. The procedure was repeated for each measuring point and configuration of the 
agitation system. 

Measures provided by the ADV with a correlation of less than 70% were eliminated [19]. The 
correlation parameter, which varies from 0 to 100, is an indicator of the relative consistency of the 
behavior of the scatterers in the sampling volume during the sampling period. ADV’s collect data at 
a higher sampling rate than the sample reporting period, and the correlation parameter indicates the 
consistency of the multiple measurements that take place within each sampling period [22]. The 
signal-to-noise ratio was always greater than 20 dB, such that the signal did not cause increased noise 
in the velocity data. Under these conditions, noise in data output should be about 1% of the velocity 
range setting [19]. 

Finally, data were averaged to obtain a single data per second, thus reducing the number of data 
to 20 for each measuring point and system configuration. The vector module was taken as the 
representative value of the velocity, independent of its direction. It is foreseeable that agitation 
systems that produce velocity flows directed against the bottom of the tank could improve agitation. 
To confirm this fact, comparative tests of product concentration/deposition would be necessary 
considering agitation systems that generate different directions of fluid flow.

velocity range setting [19].

that produce velocity flows directed against the bottom of the tank could improve agitation. To confirm

agitation systems that generate different directions of fluid flow.

2.5. Efficiency of the Agitation System

A test was carried out to analyse the efficiency of the agitation system. Copper oxychloride was
added to the tank at a theoretical concentration of 0.4%. The sprayer was regulated at a pressure of 10
bar and the number of activated nozzles was set to 2 or 4. For each number of nozzles, five samples of



Sensors 2018, 18, 3715 6 of 13

20 mL were taken at the outlet of the sprayer with the following volumes in the tank: 1000 L, 2000 L,
and 3000 L. A total of 30 samples were collected. The concentration of copper oxychloride for each
sample was measured by weighing after drying with precision scale at a temperature of 105 ◦C.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Effect of Independent Variables on Fluid Velocity

Considering the entire data set, the absolute velocity of the water varied between 0.69 and
37.37 cm/s. The mean velocity was 11.22 cm/s with a standard deviation of 5.95 cm/s.

The fluid velocity variable did not show a normal distribution based on the results of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S = 0.080; p < 0.001). Therefore, to analyse the effects of regulation
parameters of the agitation system (independent variables) on water velocity at the different measuring
points inside the tank, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (SPSS Statistics v22, IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA) was used. In this sense, the main independent variables of regulation of the agitation system
were level of water inside the tank (1000, 2000, or 3000 L), the pressure of the nozzle circuit (8, 10, or
12 bar), and the number of nozzles working simultaneously (2 or 4).

The fluid velocity values corresponded to the resulting absolute velocities of the three Cartesian
coordinates (module of the velocity vector) measured by the ADV. Table 4 shows the results of the
Kruskal-Wallis test in relation to the effect of the main independent variables on the fluid velocity.
All variables had a significant effect on fluid velocity.

Considering the effect of the level of water inside the tank (1000, 2000 and 3000 L) and the
pressure of the agitation circuit, Figure 5 shows the mean fluid velocity according to the level of water
and the pressure. The fluid velocity decreased significantly as the water level in the tank increased.
Considering mean values of all data, the fluid velocities for 1000, 2000 and 3000 L were 15.18, 12.19,
and 9.61 cm/s, respectively. This fact shows that the lowest velocity values were produced when the
tank was full. Results are in accordance with those obtained by [23] who used an ADV velocimeter in
an aquaculture circular tank and, considering similar inlet flow rates, obtained higher velocities with
the lower levels of water in the tank.

This fact must be considered in future design and validation phases in such way that the most
demanding conditions for the agitation system occur when the tank is full. This effect was repeated
for the different working pressures (Figure 5) and for the different number of nozzles of the agitation
system (Figure 6).

The pressure of the agitation circuit also had a significant influence on the fluid velocity, with
higher velocities generally occurring as the pressure increased (Figure 5). These data were consistent
with those obtained by [10], who measured fluid velocity using a hot-film anemometer at nine points
inside a sprayer tank of 1136 L, working with four nozzles, and registered fluid velocity increments
between 40% and 130% as the system pressure increased from 2.07 to 4.70 bar.

The number of active nozzles in the agitation system also significantly affected the fluid velocity
(Figure 6); with 4 nozzles activated the velocities were lower than those with 2 nozzles (11.95 vs.
10.45 cm/s). This fact reflects that the location of the nozzles within the tank can affect the fluid velocity
more significantly than does the number of nozzles activated. In this case, the nozzles were located on
opposite sides of the tank so the effect of increasing the number of nozzles did not result in an increase

in velocity. However, [10], who worked with 8 nozzles in the agitation system, registered a 14.8%
velocity increase compared with that for 4 nozzles, although in this case all of the nozzles were aligned
in the lower part of the tank, placed on the same work plane. This fact reinforces the importance of
properly locating nozzles inside the tank, and the usefulness of velocity measurement systems, such
that tested here, to validate this location.

cm/s). This fact reflects that the location of the nozzles within the tank can affect the fluid velocity 
more significantly than does the number of nozzles activated. In this case, the nozzles were located 
on opposite sides of the tank so the effect of increasing the number of nozzles did not result in an 
increase in velocity. However, [10], who worked with 8 nozzles in the agitation system, registered a 
14.8% velocity increase compared with that for 4 nozzles, although in this case all of the nozzles were 
aligned in the lower part of the tank, placed on the same work plane. This fact reinforces the 
importance of properly locating nozzles inside the tank, and the usefulness of velocity measurement 
systems, such that tested here, to validate this location.

3.2. Effect of Measurement Point Position

The position of the measuring point inside the tank had a significant influence on the fluid velocity.
Table 5 shows the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test in relation to the effect of measuring point position
(section, height, and measurement point) on the fluid velocity. All variables had a significant effect on
fluid velocity.

Considering the system as a function of the tank fill level, for all working pressures and number of
nozzles, Figures 7 and 8 show the fluid velocity as a function of the height and the section. There was
no repetitive pattern in relation to the effect of the measurement height. Thus, for 2000 L capacity,
height 2 recorded higher velocity values than did height 1, a trend that was reversed when the tank
was full. In relation to the measurement section, Sections 3 and 4 had lower velocity values compared
with Sections 1 and 2. In this case, the behaviour was repetitive, regardless of the tank fill level, with
Section 2 having the highest velocities, followed by Section 1, then Sections 3 and 4. Thus, the influence
of inner tank partitioning (Figure 2) on the recorded velocity values was clear.

The average copper oxychloride concentrations were 0.446% for 2 nozzles and 0.439% for 4 nozzles.

Table 7 shows the average velocities (considering all measurement points) and concentrations of
copper oxychloride for tank fill levels of 1000, 2000, and 3000 L, and for two or four nozzles at a working
pressure of 10 bar. The velocity values show a clear correlation with copper oxychloride concentration
(linear correlation, R2 = 0.87; polynomial correlation, R2 = 0.96), with higher velocity values associated
with higher concentrations. The coefficient of variation for the oxychloride concentration was 5.07%,
which is a good value showing a great uniformity, for all fill level and nozzle number configurations.
This indicates that the working velocity range for 10-bar regulation (9.38 to 15.96 cm/s) was sufficient
to ensure a suitable mixture in the tank.

Xiongkuy et al. [24] concluded that the efficacy of agitation was improved by increases in both
flow rate and working pressure; similar conclusions were obtained by other researchers [5]. In turn,
it can be concluded that an increase in fluid velocity will produce an improvement in the efficacy of
the agitation system.

Our tests showed higher concentrations of active matter for higher fluid velocities within the tank.
This fact could indicate a greater ability of the system to mobilize active matter when fluid velocities
are higher, reducing the deposition. However, differences in concentrations were low (Table 7) and
further tests must be carried out to validate the results.

Independently, ADV velocimeters appears as a useful tool to set minimum velocity levels to
guarantee acceptable coefficients of variation in the values of active matter concentration. This would
require previous tests of active matter concentration, which, once carried out, would serve as
correlation data for the practical use of ADV sensors as an indirect tool to estimate the efficiency
of the agitation system.

4. Conclusions

ADV technology was successfully used to measure fluid velocities inside the tank of an
agricultural sprayer. This technology has made it possible to evaluate the effect of sprayers’ hydraulic
agitation system control parameters (i.e., water level inside the tank, hydraulic circuit pressure, and
number of active nozzles) on fluid velocity. ADV is able to measure the flow speed near the bottom
and boundaries of the tank because the total height of the sampling volume of the sensor is 9 mm.

All control parameters had a significant influence on the fluid velocity. Fluid velocities increased
with increasing working pressure, but decreased as the tank fill level increased and as the number of
active nozzles increased. In addition, the concentration of active matter in the fluid increased with
increase of fluid velocity.

ADV technology makes it possible to validate the design of agitation systems in agricultural
sprayers and to estimate the efficiency of these systems in order to guarantee the concentration of
active matter in the fluid.
