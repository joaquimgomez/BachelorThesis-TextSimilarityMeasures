Introduction 
Hand-held spray guns and lances are the most widely used methods of crop protection in 
greenhouses despite the heavy workload and high risk of operator exposure associated with these 
techniques (Foqué 2012). These spray application techniques have also proved to be less effective 
than spray boom equipment under many conditions while the advantages of using vertical boom 
sprayers compared with using hand-held sprayers or lances have been widely reported in terms of 
coverage and uniformity of spray distribution (Sánchez-Hermosilla, 2012). However, problems with 
penetration capacity have been described with vertical boom sprayers without air-assistance 
(Derksen 2001). The purpose of this research was to improve spray application techniques in 
greenhouses considering the spray quality on canopy by using hand-held trolley with vertical 
boom an including an air assistance system. 

Material and Methods 
Two trials in different greenhouses with similar characteristics (LAI and plant layout) were carried 
out in comparable field conditions but with a hand-held trolley prototype with several 
improvements and variations. Experiment 1 compared the spray deposition of the hand-held 
trolley prototype with and without an air assistance system, while experiment 2 studied the spray 
deposition of the sprayer prototype using two different air flow rates. 

Experiment 1 was carried out in a commercial tomato greenhouse in El Ejido (Almería, South 
Spain).Canopy characteristics were: LAI: 5.96 and TRV: 10868 m3·ha-1. The sprayer had two vertical 
spray booms with flat fan nozzles spaced 0.3 m working at a 5.2 bar pressure, and was tested with 
and without air assistance. The air delivery system consisted of an air output for each spray nozzle 
with an average air velocity of 14 m·s-1. The volume application rate was 1000 L·ha-1(according 
farmer experience) at a forward speed of 3 km·h-1. In the mixture sprayed a tracer (Helios SC 500, 
Syngenta Crop Protection AG, Basel, Switzerland) was used at a concentration of 0.1% v/v. Twelve 
samples of 5 leaves each were randomly collected along the sprayed row from three heights and 
from the external and internal side of the canopy along de row. Values of deposition were 
expressed in ng·cm-2 of leaf. 

Experiment 2 was carried out in a commercial tomato greenhouse in Viladecans (Barcelona, North 
East Spain). Canopy characteristics were: LAI of 5.46 and TRV 10468 m3·ha-1. In this case, the sprayer 
had two vertical booms with flat fan nozzles spaced 0.35m working at a pressure of 2 bar. A similar 
air assistance system to the first experiment was fitted up with the possibility to change the air 
blower unit: blower A consists of a motor engine turbine that generates 20 m·s-1 air speed; and 
blower B was an electric engine turbine that generates 14 m·s-1. An intended volume application 
rate of 800 L·ha-1 was set-up at a forward speed of 3.5 km·h-1. Tartrazine (E-102) was used as tracer 
at a concentration of 15 g·L-1. To assess the spray distribution, artificial collectors (filter paper) were 
placed at three heights and two sides of canopy (internal and external) in nine replicates along the 
canopy row. Results were also expressed in μL·cm-2. 

Data from both experiments were normalized by tracer tank concentration and volume 
application rate.

Results and discussion 
The results of Experiment 1 shows a significant increase of global spray deposition when air 
assistance is included (Figure1, left). Moreover, deposition of the internal part of the canopy was 
higher with air assistance(1.14 and 2.19 ng·cm-2with no air and air, respectively). In Experiment 2, 
blower B (14 m·s-1) gave both the highest deposition on the canopy(Figure 1, right) and also the 
highest canopy penetration (0.09 and 0.11 μg·cm-2for blower A and blower B, respectively).

filter paper (right). 

Conclusions  
The use of air assistance increased the deposition on the canopy and further improved 
penetration inside the crop. Comparing different air speed settings, there was no advantage 
increasing the air speed above 14 m·s-1.
