Abstract 
 
This paper presents the results of a 1-year monitoring period of the SCHOTT Ibérica 
multifunctional, coloured PV façade, pointing out the importance of evaluation of results 
through monitoring in the field of innovative sustainable solar architecture under specific 
regional conditions. 
The intention is to prove the effectiveness of the adopted solutions analyzing: 
• the thermal behaviour of new developed coloured PV façade modules ASI THRU Colour  
• the thermal comfort of the interior space and  
• the overall reduction of energy consumption of the building, thus reflecting the 

importance of the whole building approach of the project. 
The monitoring results of the SCHOTT Ibércia Solar Façade have to be understood as 
accompanying results of a project for the energetic refurbishment of an office building 
through the architectural integration of photovoltaics.  
 
Keywords: Solar Architecture, Building Integration, Photovoltaic, Monitoring. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The current project was developed in 2005 as an energetic remodelling of a five-story 
staircase and the adjacent zones of an office building in the Barcelona area that suffered from 
severe problems of overheating due to an insufficient ventilation strategy, the lack of sun 
shading, and an overall defective  thermal behaviour. 
A multifunctional double-glazed curtain wall façade consistent of innovative combinations of 
transparent PV panels and coloured and printed glass elements has been developed to 
substitute industrial fix glazing elements. [1] 
The realized grid connected PV installation consists of 27 modules ASI THRU Colour with 50 
Wp each, resulting in 1,35 kWp totally installed power. Modules are characterized through a 
transparent frame area and a cell area with 10 % transparency. Façade orientation is 45º 
south-west. 
An optimized natural ventilation strategy has been developed to respond to the special 
condition of the staircase as an intermediate space between the air-conditioned office space 
and the exterior. 
Thermal measurements were made and simulation tools were used to define the right 
combination of materials and ventilation openings in terms of sun shading, daylight use, 
electricity production, natural ventilation and architectural quality.

A corporate identity concept has been developed through the intelligent mixture of different 
building materials, produced by the client himself, like coloured glass and PV panels. Screen-
printed glass has been used as a design feature and to increase sun protection. (Figures 1 to 3) 
 
The project has been completed in May 2005 and presented at the ISES Solar World Congress 
2005 in Orlando [2]. It is monitored since then through 24 temperature sensors distributed on 
interior and exterior surfaces of the applied modules to measure the different thermal 
behaviour of the different coloured glass-PV panels. Inside air temperature has been measured 
in winter and summer periods and compared to measurements before the intervention. A 
substantial improvement could be reached in all terms, from thermal behaviour and natural 
ventilation of the staircase to visual, aesthetic and functional qualities.

The results of the 1-year monitoring period of this multifunctional, coloured PV façade shall 
proof the effectiveness of the adopted solutions in the field of PV façade elements, thermal 
comfort and the overall reduction of energy consumption of the building. In the following, 
each of these three aspects, namely PV, comfort and energy consumption, is discussed 
independently. 
 
 
2. Measurements of thermal behaviour of double glass amorphous silicon 
ASITHRU colour PV panels 
 
2.1  Introduction 
The realized measurements of the thermal behaviour of the new ASI THRU Colour PV panels, 
installed as prototypes at the SCHOTT Ibérica office building in Sant Adrià del Besós 
(Barcelona), are part of the overall research and development process of this innovative PV 
product. 
Measuring the surface temperature distribution of 3 panels of different colours provides 
information about the influence of different glass colours on the overall temperature of the 
element, the colour related thermal stress of materials and possible electrical output reduction. 
 
2.2  Description 
ASI THRU Colour is a combination of the transparent amorphous silicon PV panel ASI THRU 
and mass coloured glass IMERA in a double glass PV element. 
Composition: 
− Outer glass: 6 mm tempered white glass + laminated 3 mm amorphous PV glass sheet 
− 16mm airspace 
− Inner glass: 3 mm IMERA coloured glass + EVA + 4 mm Float glass 
Three different colours of IMERA have been compared: green (IMERA D5672), dark yellow 
(IMERA D7328) and blue (IMERA D4218) with absorption coefficients of 0,31 (green), 0,55 
(dark yellow) and 0,63 (blue).  



Each element has two outside and two inside sensors, two of them on the transparent and 
coloured glass frames (outer and inner surface), and two almost touching the cell area (also on 
both the inner and outer surfaces). 
  
2.3  Technical data of measurements 
The system consisted of 24 temperature thermocouple sensors type PT 100 (Figure 4), a data 
logger type SIC 100 (Figure 5) and a PC with monitoring software (Figure 6). 
Measurement period: 24 of august 2005 – 31 of august 2005.

2.4  Results  
For each of the different coloured PV elements the 4 mentioned temperature values were 
registered and compared. 
Maximum panel surface temperatures were reached on outside cell surface (blue: 69 º C, dark 
yellow: 61º C, green: 52º C). 
Maximum temperature variations reached during one day: blue: ΔT= 45º C, dark yellow: ΔT= 
37º C, green: ΔT= 28º C. 
Temperature of outside cell surface area is up to 20 degrees higher than that of outside 
transparent frame area (blue: ΔT= 20º C, dark yellow: ΔT= 18º C, green: ΔT= 10º C).  
The inside coloured frame area absorbs solar radiation and gets up to 15 degrees warmer than 
the inside cell covered surface (blue: ΔT= 15º C, dark yellow: ΔT= 14º C, green: ΔT= 10º C). 
(Figures 7 and 8).

2.5  Discussion of results 
A high temperature difference can be registered between cell area and transparent frame area 
in all panels, outside and inside, due to different absorption coefficients.  
This means considerable thermal stress especially within the outer glass sheet of the panels. 



But also in the inner part of the double glass PV element, thermal stress is introduced due to 
the combination of PV with coloured glass, depending on glass colour and the related 
absorption coefficient. 
It has to be taken into account that some technical aspects and the characteristics of the 
project led to a set of circumstances, which could be a limitation in the exactness of the 
results. The thermocouple sensors on outside surfaces had to be installed during the 
construction process and could not be accessed afterwards. Correct glass contact cannot be 
proven and direct solar radiation not be avoided. As cell area could not be covered with 
sensors directly, outside cell surface sensors were placed directly at the border between cell 
area and transparent frame area. Finally higher inside air temperature during weekends and 
holidays due to closed windows could influence inside surface temperature of the façade. 
 
2.6  Conclusions 
It has been shown that considerable additional thermal stress is introduced due to the 
incorporation of a coloured glass sheet into the double glass PV panel ASI THRU. Cell 
temperature could rise about 10 to 15º C in comparison with a panel of similar characteristics 
without colour. Glass qualities have to meet these additional thermal requirements. Possible 
losses in electrical output due to higher temperatures have to be evaluated. Although 
amorphous silicon cells are not as temperature sensitive as other types of cells, a temperature 
coefficient of approximately -0,20%/ ºC has to be taken into account [3], which could lead to 
a reduction of 2-3 % in electrical power generation at some moments. 
 
 
3.  Results of air temperature measurements in staircase with new ASI THRU 
Colour PV façade 
 
3.1  Introduction 
The air temperature measurements inside the staircase of the SCHOTT Ibérica office 
building, directly behind the new transparent coloured PV façade shall proof the effectiveness 
of this innovative façade in terms of sun protection, natural ventilation and overall comfort. 
The comparison with measurements made before the refurbishment allow quantifying the 
improvement reached through the new project. The exactitude of the performed thermal 
dynamic simulation made with TRNSYS can be evaluated. 
 
3.2  Description 
Thermal dynamic simulation with TRNSYS calculated a maximum air temperature for 
summer of about 48 ºC between second and third floor with roof door closed. Calculated air 
temperature still reached 44 ºC with the roof door used as ventilation opening.  
For the new optimized PV façade a maximum interior air temperature of 35 ºC was predicted 
(Figure 9). 
Air temperature was measured in 6 different points of the building. Data loggers were placed 
on different levels within the staircase to register temperature stratification.  
 
3.3  Technical data of measurements 
Period of measurements: July and August 2004 and 2005.  
Used technical equipment: TESTO data logger 175-2, PC and Software TESTOSTOR 175. 
 
3.4  Results 
Measurements with the existing façade showed inside air temperature during summer 2004 
reaching up to 46 ºC in the upper part of the staircase in August (Figure 10) with roof door 
used as ventilation opening. 
Repeated measurements during summer 2005 registered maximum air temperatures of 35 ºC 
for a typical summer week. (Figure 10)

3.5  Discussion of results 
Air temperature maximums in the staircase dropped around 10 to 13 ºC during hot summer 
days after realisation of the new solar façade, mainly due to the improved sun protection and 
natural ventilation. Taking in to account that the average ambient temperature during August 
2005 was 3 to 5 ºC lower than during August 2004, an adjusted temperature drop of 8 to 10 
ºC can be described. 
This corresponds exactly to the thermal improvement calculated by the TRNSYS simulation. 
 
3.6  Conclusions 
Serious improvement of the thermal comfort of the staircase could be reached through the 
new SCHOTT Ibérica solar façade. The main problem of overheating could be solved. Inside 
air temperature in the staircase lays just 3-5 ºC over ambient temperature during hot summer 
days. Thermal simulation results have shown to be a good approximation. 
 
  
4.  Results of the overall energy performance of the façade and the building 
 
4.1  Introduction 
At an overall scale the energy performance of the building shall be evaluated in the field of 
electricity production of the photovoltaic installation and the electricity consumption of the 
building for heating and cooling. A comparison with the predicted performance allows a 
critical view on the exactitude of the thermal dynamic simulation tool TRNSYS, applied in 
this project.  
 
4.2  Description 
The overall electricity consumption for heating and cooling was predicted by TRNSYS 
simulation to drop around 8% annually, after realisation of the new solar façade, which means 
about 5,6 t less CO2 emissions and a considerable economic saving. Whereas cooling loads 
were supposed to decrease by 15 % (Figure 11), heating loads were predicted to rise slightly 
due to less passive solar gains in winter.  
 
4.3  Technical data of measurements  
Due to technical limitations, data of electrical consumption only exists for the whole office 
building without differentiation of specific areas of consumption. This data was provided by 
the maintenance unit of the company and consists of monthly readings of the electricity 
meter. 
 
4.4  Results 
Monthly comparison of total electricity consumption for the years 2004 and 2005 show a 
surprisingly high reduction especially during summer (Figure 12).  
May to October show an average reduction of about 17,0 %.  



The average monthly reduction throughout the year is about 11,7 %. In winter a light increase 
of electricity consumption can be detected during November and December.

Moreover, the energy production of the PV installation, estimated to give an annual 
production of 1.4 MWh, fulfils the expected performance, according to first data of electricity 
output. 
 
4.5  Interpretation of results 
The overall energy performance of the new façade can be considered successful in terms of 
both renewable energy production and reduction of the cooling load of the building. 
Nevertheless summer 2005 has been less extreme than summer 2004 what has to be taken into 
consideration. Long term monitoring will assure the right interpretation of the results. The 
performed thermal simulation forecasts the right tendency, indicating considerable energy 
savings through reduction of the cooling load.  
 
4.6  Conclusions 
The overall energy production and energy consumption of the building is an important 
indicator for the overall evaluation of the success of the energetic refurbishment. In the case 
under analysis, the refurbishment can be considered satisfactory under an energy standpoint.   
 
 
5. Conclusion 
The monitoring of the SCHOTT Ibérica Solar Façade has resulted in interesting data about the 
thermal behaviour of the new ASI THRU Colour PV modules, the thermal comfort of the 
interior space and the overall energy consumption of the building. 
Nevertheless, difficulties in controlling some measurement factors recommend interpreting 
results as tendencies rather than exact data. 
With such cautions taken,  it has been proven that the newly developed coloured PV elements 
fulfil technical and thermal requirements as a façade material and that the adopted 
architectural solution meets the expectations as a piece of innovative and sustainable solar 
architecture.
