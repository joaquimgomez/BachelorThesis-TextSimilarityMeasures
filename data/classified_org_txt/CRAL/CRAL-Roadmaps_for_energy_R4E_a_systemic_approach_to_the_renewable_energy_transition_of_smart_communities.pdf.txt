Abstract

District heating networks are commonly addressed in the literature as one of the most effective solutions for decreasing the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. These systems require high investments which are returned through the heat
sales. Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, 
prolonging the investment return period. 
The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand – outdoor temperature function for heat demand 
forecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 
buildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district 
renovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were 
compared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors.
The results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications
(the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation 
scenarios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). 
The value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the 
decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and 
renovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the 
coupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and 
improve the accuracy of heat demand estimations.

1. Background 

The R4E project (www.roadmapsforenergy.eu) responds to the EE-07-2014 call entitled “Enhancing the capacity of 
public authorities to plan and implement sustainable energy policies and measures” within the Secure, Clean and 
Efficient Energy Work Program of HORIZON 2020 of the European Commission. The main challenge of the 
partners within R4E is to develop visioning and roadmapping capacities within municipalities to initiate joint 
activities to spur development and implementation of innovative energy solutions in cities.  

The implementation of strategies and plans on municipal level suffers from the effects of the recent global 
economic and financial crisis, the shifting of competences and responsibilities between government levels, 
difficulties within organizations to meet the necessary, and changing, skills and capacities; and a lack of knowledge 
on the state of the art concerning technological and organizational innovation. This leads to imperfect 
implementation processes and loss of faith in the usefulness of strategies and action plans. 

In order to overcome these barriers, R4E established the following objectives: 
 

   Creating high quality visions and roadmaps that drive collaboration between municipalities, entrepreneurs, 
knowledge institutes and citizens to achieve longer term ambitious goals through short term decisions and actions 
   Implementing with all partners a similar participative process for vision and roadmap development that enables 
continuous cross-city learning exchange of experiences, challenges and best practices. 
   Building an ecosystem of relevant local parties in each city, laying the foundation for extended collaboration 
between partners to drive innovation for sustainability purposes, through joint projects, e.g. joint pre-commercial 
procurement projects. 
 

This ambitious approach requires new processes and tools in order to foster understanding, communication and 
informed, shared decision-making among stakeholders.  

   

2. Introduction 
Our western societies are recently experiencing a strong shift towards participation of citizens and all type of 

interest groups in participatory, multi stakeholder processes, with the aim to find consensus among individual 
interests regarding societal changes and challenges, especially in the field of transition towards sustainability. 

In the technological field so-called user-centered research has been developed in order to capture user insights or 
user behavior regarding innovations with the aim of shortening product-to-market periods and gaining higher 
security regarding user adoption and market success of a product or service. New infrastructures and processes have 
been developed like e.g. Living Labs and Open Innovation strategies.   

Similar processes are increasingly taking place in the area of governance and decision making within 
municipalities, where citizens, entrepreneurs, academics and local entities as “users”, are expected to contribute to 
collective innovation and decision making processes. 

Similar to the questionable role of users as actors in the field of innovation (lack of experts knowledge, lack of 
motivation for continuity, IP rights and exploitation of results) the capacity of individual stakeholders has to be 
questioned in overviewing the whole process e.g. of the current transformation processes of cities towards more 
sustainable energy models. These processes are highly complex and open ended, including technological 
developments and changes, legislation, governance, societal changes and social innovations, linked to individual as 
well as collective value discussions and behavior changes regarding our lifestyle.

1. Background 

The R4E project (www.roadmapsforenergy.eu) responds to the EE-07-2014 call entitled “Enhancing the capacity of 
public authorities to plan and implement sustainable energy policies and measures” within the Secure, Clean and 
Efficient Energy Work Program of HORIZON 2020 of the European Commission. The main challenge of the 
partners within R4E is to develop visioning and roadmapping capacities within municipalities to initiate joint 
activities to spur development and implementation of innovative energy solutions in cities.  

The implementation of strategies and plans on municipal level suffers from the effects of the recent global

difficulties within organizations to meet the necessary, and changing, skills and capacities; and a lack of knowledge 
on the state of the art concerning technological and organizational innovation. This leads to imperfect

2. Introduction 
Our western societies are recently experiencing a strong shift towards participation of citizens and all type of 

interest groups in participatory, multi stakeholder processes, with the aim to find consensus among individual 
interests regarding societal changes and challenges, especially in the field of transition towards sustainability. 

In the technological field so-called user-centered research has been developed in order to capture user insights or

 Masseck, T. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000–000   3

The R4E project therefor takes a different approach to current energy strategies and plans, developing so-called 
“Energy Roadmaps”. The unique feature of the Roadmaps approach is that the process of development takes 
successful implementation through partnership and through an in-depth knowledge of the state of the art, now and in 
the near future, as a starting point. This approach is based on: 

 An ongoing learning process among all stakeholders, acquiring the necessary technical and systemic knowledge 
of complex transition processes. 

 Better communication among all participants, experts, politicians, researchers, entrepreneurs and citizens through 
a common language and trust building collective processes. 

 More consistent and consented outcomes, which increase decisively the possibilities for a successful 
implementation of resulting action plans. 
 
R4E offers a new strategy for complex transition processes of society towards a sustainable energy future, 

fostering within participatory processes the knowledge generation and improvement of the diverse stakeholder 
groups regarding renewable energy technologies, and a systemic view of energy in buildings and the urban context 
in general. 

 

3. Methodology 
R4E applies a specific 4-step process for the project itself, a specific 4-step structure for its desk studies as 

supporting documents for participatory stakeholder processes, and a specific approach for the learning and 
communication process of stakeholders through Systemic Solution Maps within the desk studies, in order to 
graphically represent the complexity of any energy-related transition process. 

 

3.1 The 4-step R4E process 

The R4E partner cities run through a 4-step R4E process (Figure 1), starting with the Ambition setting (step 1), 
and a Vision development and scenario building process (step 2) in order to discuss, define and describe a common 
desired future for their city with the participation of all type of local stakeholders such as citizens as well as relevant 
research and industry partners. In a third step partners develop Energy Roadmaps as the result of a cooperative 
process engaging, as in all previous steps, key stakeholders within the region from the business and knowledge 
sectors.  

 
Fig. 1: 4-step R4E process 

4 Masseck, T. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017) 000–000 

This results finally in the development of a specific Project portfolio (step 4) and well-developed implementation 
plans supported through a strong commitment of all participants. Figure 2 shows the general R4E approach in four 
steps. The R4E process allows ideally engaging partners and stakeholder groups in a continuous process over 3 
years and beyond, creating a strong collaboration based on trust and integration among all participants. 

 

3.2 Desk Study structure 

In order to support the participatory processes of the R4E project in generating consistent roadmaps for energy 
and solid implementation plans, desk studies about the state of the art of energy technologies and related 
sustainability concepts and solutions are facilitated to the participant cities.  

These desk studies include the following 4-step approach in order to structure knowledge and give consistent 
future outlooks on technologies related to smart energy strategies of cities (Figure 2). 

 
Fig. 2: R4E Desk study structure 

After describing and further defining the Smart Main Strategies of the partner cities, based on the developed 
visions and scenarios for their energy future with horizon 2050, so called Systemic Solutions Maps are developed in 
order to represent graphically the complexity of each strategy and its interrelation with diverse concepts and 
technologies.  

A third step consist in specific Technology Outlooks about technologies that have been mapped within the 
Systemic Solutions Maps, documenting their current state of the art, their specific challenges and their future 
perspectives. 

In a fourth step Case Studies are referenced to the different Systemic Solutions in order to showcase light house 
projects of urban energy transition, which already apply specific smart strategies or smart technologies for a 
sustainable energy future.  

This desk study structure allows all partners to generate and improve their knowledge in fields like e.g. the 
energetic refurbishment of existing buildings, or the establishment of smart energy grids with a high amount of 
distributed renewable energy sources, among many others, gaining a holistic and systemic vision of each strategy. 
The specific feature of Systemic Solutions Maps furthermore allows to be used as individual or collective tool for 
understanding complexity and interrelations among different strategies and technologies.  

In the following the approach of Systemic Solutions Maps is further described.

This results finally in the development of a specific Project portfolio (step 4) and well-developed implementation 
plans supported through a strong commitment of all participants. Figure 2 shows the general R4E approach in four 
steps. The R4E process allows ideally engaging partners and stakeholder groups in a continuous process over 3 
years and beyond, creating a strong collaboration based on trust and integration among all participants. 

 

3.2 Desk Study structure 

In order to support the participatory processes of the R4E project in generating consistent roadmaps for energy 
and solid implementation plans, desk studies about the state of the art of energy technologies and related 
sustainability concepts and solutions are facilitated to the participant cities.  

These desk studies include the following 4-step approach in order to structure knowledge and give consistent 
future outlooks on technologies related to smart energy strategies of cities (Figure 2).

3.3 Systemic Solution Maps 

Systemic Solution Maps are introduced as comprehensive representation of the inherent complexity of almost any 
strategy towards a reduced energy demand and a higher degree of sustainability on building level as well as on 
urban scale. 

Systemic Solution Maps (Figure 3) are connecting elements, which allow to set into the right relation the basic 
Smart Main Strategies for a sustainable energy future and the existing and developing energy technologies as well 
as related technological solutions described in the Technology Outlook section.  

 
Fig. 3: General Structure of Systemic Solution Maps 

The developed systemic representation allows mapping visually the interrelation of different parameters for a 
specific approach, e.g, in the field of material flows, water consumption or renewable energy generation, facilitating 
the understanding of the complexity of each specific field of action. 

 System Solution Maps are meant to be dynamic tools, which enable processes of discussion about the 
interrelation of technical, organizational and social aspects, including rich reference to corresponding developing 
technological solutions and important case studies.  

Stakeholders may read and reflect individually on these Systemic Solution Maps, may use them in their 
discussions and participatory processes, and even might adapt or develop them further according to their city 
specific social-economical, climatic, cultural and environmental background. 

This allows transforming a generic, limited representation of the complexity of specific fields of action into rich 
visions of a possible future of individual cities.

3.4 Experts Interviews and Generic Roadmaps 

Based on the thematic fields of the developed desk studies and the desired future scenarios of the cities, 
international experts have been identified in order to conduct expert’s interviews on future developments, with a 
specific outlook until 2050. Experts from industry, knowledge institutes and governments from all over Europe have 
been interviewed personally between May and October 2016. A minor number of interviews have been held via 
Skype calls, sharing common city visions via email or shared screen during the interview. 

The duration of interviews was between 1 to 1.5 hours. Some experts contributed to both fields of knowledge, 
Smart buildings and Smart urban spaces, as thematic areas overlap within a holistic view on cities and societies 
energy transition. 

All resulting answers have been clustered according to their similarities in content, creating different thematic 
fields a, e.g. in the area of renewable energy systems, legislation or behavior change of citizens.   

Figure 4 shows the 4 steps, which led to the generation of Generic Roadmaps.  

 
Fig. 4: Process of generation of Generic Roadmaps 

For each thematic field as specific timeline has been created covering developments on near, mid and long-term 
until 2050. Finally all 3 Generic Roadmaps have been synchronized in timescales and contents, leading to the final 
version, which will be delivered together with Roadmap Animations and the Desk Studies to the city partners. 

 

4. Results 
The R4E project has just concluded half of its third step, Roadmapping, within the overall 4-step process. Desk 

studies have been almost finished, Experts have been interviewed on each of the 3 main fields of knowledge, and 
Generic Roadmaps have been created as result on all of these activities. Desk studies and Generic Roadmaps will be 
handed out to partners during December 2016. 

A total of 18 Systemic Solutions Maps have been developed in the fields of Smart Buildings and Smart Urban 
Spaces in order to map the complexity of different and diverse approaches like Interactive Flexible Space Use, 
Collaborative Urban Planning, Communal Urban Farming, Thermal Smart Grids, Material Accounting Systems, or 
Health and Home Services in the field or Smart Urban Spaces, and concepts like Shared Use Management, Green 
Energy production, Smart Retrofitting Solutions, Waste Management, Building Water Management or Low 
Embodied Energy among others in the field of Smart Buildings.

Systemic Solution Maps are introduced as comprehensive representation of the inherent complexity of almost any 
strategy towards a reduced energy demand and a higher degree of sustainability on building level as well as on 
urban scale. 

Systemic Solution Maps (Figure 3) are connecting elements, which allow to set into the right relation the basic 
Smart Main Strategies for a sustainable energy future and the existing and developing energy technologies as well 
as related technological solutions described in the Technology Outlook section.  

 
Fig. 3: General Structure of Systemic Solution Maps 

The developed systemic representation allows mapping visually the interrelation of different parameters for a 
specific approach, e.g, in the field of material flows, water consumption or renewable energy generation, facilitating 
the understanding of the complexity of each specific field of action. 

 System Solution Maps are meant to be dynamic tools, which enable processes of discussion about the 
interrelation of technical, organizational and social aspects, including rich reference to corresponding developing 
technological solutions and important case studies.  

Stakeholders may read and reflect individually on these Systemic Solution Maps, may use them in their 
discussions and participatory processes, and even might adapt or develop them further according to their city 
specific social-economical, climatic, cultural and environmental background. 

This allows transforming a generic, limited representation of the complexity of specific fields of action into rich 
visions of a possible future of individual cities.

3.4 Experts Interviews and Generic Roadmaps 

Based on the thematic fields of the developed desk studies and the desired future scenarios of the cities, 
international experts have been identified in order to conduct expert’s interviews on future developments, with a 
specific outlook until 2050. Experts from industry, knowledge institutes and governments from all over Europe have 
been interviewed personally between May and October 2016. A minor number of interviews have been held via 
Skype calls, sharing common city visions via email or shared screen during the interview. 

The duration of interviews was between 1 to 1.5 hours. Some experts contributed to both fields of knowledge, 
Smart buildings and Smart urban spaces, as thematic areas overlap within a holistic view on cities and societies 
energy transition. 

All resulting answers have been clustered according to their similarities in content, creating different thematic 
fields a, e.g. in the area of renewable energy systems, legislation or behavior change of citizens.   

Figure 4 shows the 4 steps, which led to the generation of Generic Roadmaps.

For each thematic field as specific timeline has been created covering developments on near, mid and long-term 
until 2050. Finally all 3 Generic Roadmaps have been synchronized in timescales and contents, leading to the final 
version, which will be delivered together with Roadmap Animations and the Desk Studies to the city partners. 

 

4. Results 
The R4E project has just concluded half of its third step, Roadmapping, within the overall 4-step process. Desk 

studies have been almost finished, Experts have been interviewed on each of the 3 main fields of knowledge, and 
Generic Roadmaps have been created as result on all of these activities. Desk studies and Generic Roadmaps will be 
handed out to partners during December 2016. 

A total of 18 Systemic Solutions Maps have been developed in the fields of Smart Buildings and Smart Urban 
Spaces in order to map the complexity of different and diverse approaches like Interactive Flexible Space Use, 
Collaborative Urban Planning, Communal Urban Farming, Thermal Smart Grids, Material Accounting Systems, or 
Health and Home Services in the field or Smart Urban Spaces, and concepts like Shared Use Management, Green 
Energy production, Smart Retrofitting Solutions, Waste Management, Building Water Management or Low 
Embodied Energy among others in the field of Smart Buildings.

Furthermore 50 Technology Outlooks have been elaborated resuming the state-of-the art and future potential of 
mapped technologies. 

First System Solution Maps and Technology Outlooks have been presented to the city partners at the joint Vision
Building Workshop in Istanbul in May 2016, obtaining valuable input from city representatives regarding the 
readability of the maps, their usefulness as tools in participatory processes, and most specially about missing or 
under represented issues, which should be included within the maps, e.g. stronger references to urban resilience 
strategies or a stronger focus on the complexity of historic buildings within the city context. 

This stakeholder feedback has allowed to introduce changes and to improve the documents for their use as 
supporting tools in the following third step of the R4E process, the city specific Roadmapping Workshops from 
December 2016 on. 

Generic Roadmaps have been created based on an important number of experts interviews with experts from 
industry, knowledge institutes and governments form all over Europe. 

The created Generic Roadmaps as well as the Desk Studies with the developed approach of Systemic Solution 
Maps and Technology Outlooks will than have to proof that they are useful tools for multi stakeholder processes, 
and that the applied mapping of complexities and relationships will result in a useful identification of potential 
synergies and even innovations. 

This might contribute to the overall results to be expected of the R4E project after its successful conclusion: 

 The empowerment of public authorities to develop, finance and implement ambitious sustainable energy policies 
and plans in order to implement efficiently recent and future European Energy Directives 

 The introduction of a significant number of public officers and stakeholders in a new way of working, necessary 
for successful development and implementation of such plans 

 The development of ambitious but effective and realistic policies and plans with an important impact on the 
behavior of final consumers 

5. Conclusions 
The sustainable energy transition of communities requires multi-stakeholder processes, which should be based on 

a high level of shared knowledge about related concepts, energy technologies and developments in the present and 
the near future in order to allow the successful collaboration of all important members of a community. The 
presented overall R4E process, with its desk studies as supporting documents and the specifically developed concept 
of Systemic Solutions Maps and related Technology Outlooks may contribute to this important knowledge 
generation and show their usefulness as tools for multi stakeholder processes towards a sustainable energy transition 
of cities.
