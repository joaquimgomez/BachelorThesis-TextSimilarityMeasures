Summary 
 

This paper deals with the computational modeling and numerical simulation of contact 

problems at finite deformations using the finite element method. Quasi-static and dynamic 

problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full stick friction and 

frictionless cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the 

contact problem, such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new 

direct elimination method is proposed. Conserving algorithms are also introduced for the 

proposed formulation for dynamic contact problems. An assessment of the performance of the 

resulting formulation is shown in a number of selected benchmark tests and numerical 

examples, including both quasi-static and dynamic contact problems under full stick friction and 

frictionless contact conditions. Conservation of key discrete properties exhibited by the time 

stepping algorithm is shown in one of the numerical examples involving the dynamic analysis 

of a contact problem.

1 Introduction, motivation and goals 

Numerical analysis of contact problems has been one of the hot research topics of interest over 

the last decades. Contact problems arise in many applications, such as in crashworthiness, 

projectile impact, and material forming processes, i.e. sheet metal forming, bulk forming, 

casting, friction stir welding, cutting, and powder compaction. Despite the important progresses 

achieved in computational contact mechanics, the numerical simulation of contact problems is 

still nowadays a complex task, mainly due to the highly nonlinear nature of the problem, 



2  D. Di Capua, C. Agelet de Saracibar   
    

   

potentially involving fully nonlinear kinematics, finite strains, large slips, nonlinear boundary 

conditions, complex frictional behavior phenomena, thermomechanical contact, etc. 

Mathematically, the numerical analysis of a frictional contact problem amounts to 

finding the solution of an Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) within a constrained solution 

space. The variational formulation of a frictional contact problem includes restrictions on the 

admissible variations in the tangent solution space induced by the contact constraints, yielding 

to Variational Inequalities (VI). See, for instance, Kikuchi & Oden (1988) [27] and Duvaut & 

Lions (1972) [19].  

A regularization of the frictional contact constraints, using penalty or augmented 

Lagrangian methods, allows us to bypass the need to find a solution within a constrained 

solution space and provides a very convenient displacement driven frictional contact 

formulation.  

The penalty method can be considered as the standard regularization procedure for 

computational modeling of frictional contact problems and it has been widely used, for instance, 

by Oden & Pires (1984) [41], Oden & Martins (1985) [42], Hallquist, Goudreau & Benson 

(1985) [22], Curnier & Alart (1988) [18], Benson & Hallquist (1990) [11], Wriggers, Vu Van & 

Stein (1990) [62], Belytschko & Neal (1991) [10], Laursen (1992, 1999, 2002) [30,35,37], 

Laursen & Simo (1991, 1992, 1993) [29,31,32], Agelet de Saracibar (1997, 1998) [1,2], Petocz 

(1998) [44], Armero & Petocz (1998, 1999) [6,7], Agelet de Saracibar & Chiumenti (1999) [4], 

Agelet de Saracibar, Cervera & Chiumenti (1999, 2001) [3,5], and Chiumenti, Agelet de 

Saracibar & Cervera (2008) [17].  

To avoid some well known drawbacks exhibited by the penalty method, such as the 

penalty sensitivity and possible ill-conditioning of the system of equations, while retaining his 

advantages, the augmented Lagrangian method has been used as an alternative regularization 

procedure. Within the frictional contact problems context, the augmented Lagrangian method 

has been used by Laursen (1992, 2002) [30,37], Simo & Laursen (1992) [50], Laursen & Simo 

(1993) [31,32], Wriggers & Zavarise (1993) [63], Laursen & Govindjee (1994) [33], Wriggers 

(1995) [64], Zavarise, Wriggers & Schrefler (1995) [66], and Chiumenti, Agelet de Saracibar & 

Cervera (2008) [17], among others. 

A perturbed Lagrangian method has been used, for instance, by Simo, Wriggers & 

Taylor (1985) [56] and Ju & Taylor (1988) [26]. 

A displacement driven formulation of the frictional contact problem allows to widely 

exploit the features of the framework developed for computational plasticity. See, for instance, 

Simo & Hughes (1998) [57] and Simo (1994) [53] for an excellent account of computational 

plasticity. In particular, return mapping algorithms developed for plasticity can be applied to 

integrate the frictional contact traction. The lowest order member of the family of backward-

difference (BD) methods, the backward-Euler (BE) time integration algorithm, has become the 

standard frictional return mapping algorithm for the regularized frictional contact constrained 

evolution problem. Frictional return mapping algorithms using the BE method have been used 

by Giannakopoulos (1989) [20], Wriggers, Vu Van & Stein (1990) [62], Laursen & Simo 

(1993) [31,32], Agelet de Saracibar (1997, 1998) [1,2], Agelet de Saracibar & Chiumenti (1999) 

[4], and Agelet de Saracibar, Cervera & Chiumenti (1999, 2001) [3,5], among others. Within 

the family of Implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods, a generalized Projected Mid-Point (PMP) 



                                                         A direct elimination algorithm for quasi-static and dynamic contact problems 3 
 

algorithm, initially proposed by Simo (1994) [53] for computational plasticity, has been 

proposed by Agelet de Saracibar (1998) [2] as frictional return mapping algorithm for the time 

integration of the frictional traction problem. 

Typically, within the framework of the Finite Element (FE) method, most of the discrete 

frictional contact problems are formulated using the local parametrization induced by the FE 

triangularization of the contact surfaces. Due to the local character of the parametrization, the 

frictional time integration algorithm may turn out to be useless if large slips are involved. A new 

frictional time integration algorithm, designed to avoid the drawbacks arising from a local 

parametrization, being suitable for large slip multi-body frictional contact problems in 2D and 

3D, has been developed by Agelet de Saracibar (1997) [1]. Time integration of the frictional 

traction is performed using Hermite interpolation functions and introducing a new slip path 

parametrization, which, remarkably, is defined on the sole basis of the outward unit normal to 

the master surface, being independently of the local surface finite element parametrization used 

in the spatial triangularization. 

A pinball algorithm for contact-impact problems, using penalty and Lagrangian 

methods, has been presented by Belytschko & Neal (1991) [10]. 

It is well known that node-to-segment (NTS) contact formulations do not pass the 

contact patch test [47]. An alternative to the node-segment contact formulation is the mortar 

segment-to-segment contact formulation. A mortar segment-to segment contact formulation for 

large deformation solid mechanics has been presented by Puso & Laursen (2004) [45,46] and 

Yang (2006) [65]. Dual active set strategies based on the mortar method have been presented by 

Wohlmuth (2000) [59], Hüeber & Wohlmuth (2005) [24], and Brunssen et al. (2007) [14].  

Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) was recently introduced by Hughes, Cottrell & Bazilevs 

(2005) [25]. Within the IGA framework, the same smooth and higher order basis functions, e.g. 

NURBS, are used for both the CAD geometry and the approximation of the FEA solution fields, 

leading to evident potential advantages in the description of interacting surfaces undergoing 

large displacements and large sliding, as recognized already in the first IGA paper [25]. A 

detailed and up-to-date review of isogeometric contact formulations can be found in Lorenzis, 

Wriggers & Hughes (2014) [38]. 

A computational model for frictionless contact problems using the null-space method 

and introducing a smoothing technique of the master surface using cubic B-spline interpolation 

has been presented by Muñoz (2008) [40]. 

Time discrete conserving algorithms for nonlinear dynamics have been proposed by 

Simo & Wong (1991) [49], Simo & Tarnow (1992) [51], Simo, Tarnow & Wong (1992) [52], 

Simo &Tarnow (1994) [54], Simo, Tarnow & Doblaré (1995) [55], Gonzalez (2000) [21], 

Laursen & Meng (2001) [36], Armero & Romero (2001) [8], Meng & Laursen (2002) [39], and 

Armero (2008) [9]. The extension of time discrete conserving algorithms for frictionless and 

frictional contact problems has been done by Chawla (1997) [15], Laursen & Chawla (1997) 

[34], Chawla & Laursen (1998) [16], Petocz (1998) [44], and Armero & Petocz (1998, 1999) 

[6,7], among others. Bravo, Pérez Aparicio & Laursen (2011) [13] have proposed an Enhanced 

Energy Conserving Algorithm (EECA) formulation for time integration of frictionless contact–

impact problems using an enhanced penalty method, featuring energy, linear and angular

momentum conservation. Energy consistent time stepping schemes for finite-dimensional 

mechanical systems with holonomic constraints have been presented by Betsch (2005) [12].  

A fully nonlinear kinematics formulation of frictionless contact problems, including the 

derivation of the algorithmic contact operators, was presented by Wriggers & Simo (1985) [59] 

for 2D problems using linear surface elements, and by Parisch (1989) [43] for 3D problems 

using linear surface elements. An extension of the formulation to frictional contact problems 

was provided by Wriggers (1987) [61]. A general fully nonlinear kinematics formulation for 

multi-body frictional contact problems at finite strains in 2D and 3D, was first developed on a 

continuum setting by Laursen & Simo (1993) [31]. The fully nonlinear kinematics formulation 

of frictional contact problems developed by Laursen & Simo (1993) [31] was extended later on 

by Agelet de Saracibar (1998) [2] for coupled thermomechanical problems, Agelet de Saracibar 

& Chiumenti (1999) [4] to account for wear phenomena, and Agelet de Saracibar, Cervera & 

Chiumenti (1999, 2001) [3,5] to account for coupled thermoplastic problems including phase-

change. 

This paper deals with the computational modeling and numerical simulation of contact 

problems at finite deformations using the finite element method. Quasi-static and dynamic 

problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full stick and frictionless 

cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the contact problem, 

such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new direct elimination 

method is proposed. A conserving algorithm is used for dynamic contact poblems.  

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the continuum 

formulation of the contact problem. Section 3 deals with the finite element formulation of the 

contactless problem. Section 4 deals with the finite element formulation and numerical solution 

of the full stick and frictionless contact cases, using the proposed direct elimination method. 

Finally, Section 5 deals with an assessment of the contact formulation proposed through a 

number of representative quasi-static and dynamic numerical examples, under full stick and 

frictionless contact conditions. The paper concludes with some final remarks. An Appendix, 

including details of the linearization of the tangent orthonormal basis defined at the closest-

point-projection on the master surface, has been also included.

We will asume that no contact forces are present between the two bodies at the

into contact and produce contact interactive forces during some portion of the time interval of

2.2 Local formulation of the contact problem 

Using the classical slave-master formulation of contact mechanics [1,2,29-33,37], let us denote 

the contact surfaces (1)c  and 
(2)
c  as slave and master contact surfaces, respectively. Particles 

of the slave and master contact surfaces will be denoted as slave particles and master particles, 

respectively.  

 Let us consider a slave particle (1) (1)cX , being  (1) (1) (1) (1), ct  x X  its current 
spatial vector position of the slave particle at time t   , and  (1) (2), ct y X  its closest-point-

where n  is the outward unit normal to the spatial configuration of the master surface at the

assumed that the following condition holds, 
 

 
    (2) (1) (1) (1), , ,t t t  n n Y X n X  (5) 

 

The nominal frictional contact vector  (1) (1) , tT X  at a slave particle (1) (1)cX  at time

           (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1), : , , , ,N T Nt t t t t t     T X t X t X X n 1 n n T X  (6)

where ( )ext i  is the potential energy for the external forces of body ( )i . 
 It can be shown [8,9,21,34,49,51,52,54,55] that the linear momentum L , angular 
momentum J , and total energy E  are conserved for a homogeneous Neumann boundary 
problem, characterized by zero body forces and zero natural boundary conditions, yielding zero 

potential energy for the external loads, i.e. 0ext  . The total energy E  is also conserved if 
the external loading is conservative. A typical case of conservative external loading is the case 

of gravitational body forces and constant prescribed nominal tractions. 
 
 
3 Finite element formulation of the continuum problem without frictional contact

Let us consider first the finite element discretization of quasi-static and dynamic continuum 

problem without frictional contact constraints. Using a standard finite element discretization, the 

material coordinates ( ) ( )i ihX , displacements 
( )iu  and material velocities ( )iV  of body ( )i , 

take the form,

3.1 Quasi-static case

 It can be shown [6-9] that using this conserving time integration scheme, the full 

discrete version of the linear momentum hL , angular momentum hJ , and total energy hE  are 

conserved for a homogeneous Neumann boundary problem, characterized by no imposed 

boundary displacements and zero external loading, zero body forces and zero natural boundary 

conditions, yielding zero semi-discrete external force vector, ( )ext iA f 0 , and zero semi discrete 
potential energy for the external loads, 0exth  . The discrete versión of the total energy hE  is 
also conserved if the external loading is conservative. 
 
 
4 Direct elimination algorithm for contact problems 
 
4.1 Introduction and notation 

Within the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems proposed in this work, the 

restrictions arising by the contact between the bodies are introduced through the direct 

elimination of the displacements of the slave nodes. From a computational implementation point 

of view, this direct elimination method is carried out through a number of transformations made 

on the global tangent operator. In order to conveniently visualize those transformations, let us 

introduce the following notation.

4.3 Full stick frictional contact case 

Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s  is subjected to the 
constraints arising from the full stick frictional contact condition. Note that for the full stick 

frictional case, once the slave node comes into contact with a master surface, the isoparametric 

coordinates of the closest-point-projection are time-independent, remaining constant in time 

while contact is active. 
 
4.3.1 Quasi-static case 

For a quasi-static case, the current position of the slave node s  is attached to the current 
position of the closest-point-projection on the master surface, which is constant in time, yielding 

the following expression: 
 

    , 1 , 1 , 1 , 11 1
mnod mnodn n

s n i mi n i mi n m ni i
N       x x N x Nx   (31) 

 

where   are the time-independent isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-
projection.  
 
4.3.2 Dynamic case 

For the dynamic case, using a discrete linear momentum and energy conserving time integration 

scheme, the mid-point velocity of the slave node s  is matched to the mid-point velocity of its 
closest-point-projection, yielding the following expression [6]: 
 

    , 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/21 1
mnod mnodn n

s n i mi n i mi n m ni i
N       v v N v Nv   (32) 

 

where the (time-independent) isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection are 

computed at the mid-point configuration.  

Using a mid-point rule time integration, equation (32) yields, 
 

  , 1 , , 1 , , 1 , 1,s n s n m n m n s n m n        x x N x x u N u  (33) 
 

Note that, for the dynamic case, it is not posible to get an algorithm simultaneously 

satisfying discrete energy and angular momentum conservation [6]. The contact constraint (32) 

yields a discrete energy conservation algorithm, but the discrete angular momentum is not 

satisfied. Alternatively, imposing that the mid-point position of the slave node s  has to be equal 



14  D. Di Capua, C. Agelet de Saracibar   
    

   

to the mid-point position of its closest-point-projection, would yield a discrete momentum 

conservation algorithm, but then the discrete energy conservation would not be satisfied [6].  
 
4.3.3 Virtual contact work 

Let us denote as ,s n f  the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s  at time n  , and 
,m n f  the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the master element 

at time n  , where 1   for the quasi-static case and 1/ 2   for the dynamic case. 
Applying the virtual work principle to the discrete contact force vectors ,s n f  and ,m n f  reads, 
 
 , , 0s s n m m n      u f u f  (34) 
 

where su  and mu  are virtual displacements of the slave and master element nodes, such 
that, taking into account that the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection 

remain constant, yields, 
 
 s m u N u  (35) 
 

Substituting (35) into (34) yields,

 From an implementation point of view, starting from the global system of equations 

given in (30), the transformations of the global tangent stiffness matrix (GSM) and residual 

force vector (RFV) needed to implement the direct elimination method for the full stick 

frictional contact problem can be summarized in the following steps, which have to be carried 

out for each slave node s : 

 Step 1. Pre-multiply row s  of the GSM by the matrix TN . 
 Step 2. Add row s  to row m  of the GSM. 
 Step 3. Post-multiply column s  of the GSM by the matrix N . 

Step 4. Add column s  to column m  of the GSM. 
Step 5. Set to zero matrix the row s , column s  of the GSM. 
Step 6. Enter a diagonal matrix 1 1

k k
n n  1  in the row s , column s  of the GSM. 

Step 7. Add the vector  , 1 , 1,T k ks s n gs n N g u u  to the row s  of the RFV.

The diagonal matrix  1 , introduced in the row s , column s  of the GSM in order 
to avoid the ill-conditioning (zero terms in the main diagonal) of the GSM, is defined as,

Remark 1. Note that block-symmetry of the resulting global tangent stiffness matrix for the full 

stick friction case is preserved.  
 
4.3.5 Update of slave and master displacements and contact status 

Once the resulting incremental iterative problem has been solved, the slave and master 

displacements are updated according to the following expressions. 

 For a quasi-static problem, the update of the master and slave displacements takes the 

form, 
 

 
, 1 , , 1

For the dynamic case, once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been 

updated, the nodal velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19). 

Once the slave and master nodes have been updated, the contact status at time n   
has to be verified, checking out if the contact is still active or not. The contact will be still active 

if the contact normal force ,:nN s n nf      f n  satisfies the following condition: 
 

  , , 1 , 1: , 0nN s n n s s n gs n nf             f n g u u n  (46)

Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s  has to be 
deactivated for the next time step. 
 

4.4 Frictionless contact case 

Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s  is subjected to the 
constraints arising from the frictionless contact condition. Note that, contrary to the full stick 

frictional case, for the frictionless case, the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-

projection are not constant in time. For the sake of concreteness, only the 3D frictionless quasi-

static and dynamic cases will be presented, being straightforward to particularize the 

formulation for 2D cases.  
 
4.4.1 Quasi-static case 

For a quasi-static case, the current position of the slave node s  can be written in terms of the 
current position of the closest-point-projection, yielding the following expression: 
 

    , 1 1 , 1 1 , 1 1 , 11 1

where 1n   are the time-dependent current isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-
projection at time 1n . 
  Taking the variation of (47) yields,

and taking into account that the covariant tangent vectors are given by , 1 , 1 , 1n n m n    N x  and 

, 1 , 1 , 1n n m n    N x  (see Appendix 1), (48)2 can be written as,

 Let us denote as , 1s nf  the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s  at time 
1n , and , 1m nf  the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the 

master element at time 1n . Applying the virtual work principle to the discrete contact force 
vectors , 1s nf  and , 1m nf  reads,

where su  and mu  are the virtual displacements of the slave and master element nodes, such 
that, taking into account the variation of the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-

projection, satisfy the following expression (see Appendix 1),

where , 1n   and , 1n   are the covariant tangent vectors to the isoparametric coordinates of the 
master surface at the closest-point-projection. 

 Substituting (51) into (50), and taking into account that . 1 , 1 0n s n   f  and 

, 1 , 1 0,n s n   f  yields,

Remark 2. Note that the two last terms on the right hand side of (49) represent the tangent 

relative displacement of the slave node with respect to the closest-point-projection, here 

naturally expressed in terms of the variations of the contravariant components of the 

isoparametric coordinates 1n   and 1n   and the covariant tangent vectors to the 
isoparametric coordinates , 1n   and , 1n  , evaluated at time 1n . Note that those tangent 
vectors span the tangent space at the closest-point-projection at time 1n , but they do not need 
to be orthonormal, not even orthogonal. Alternatively, the tangent space could be spanned by an 

orthonormal basis defined by orthogonal unit tangent vectors 1, 1n  and 2, 1n  at the closest-
point-projection at time 1n  . Then, (49) can be alternatively expressed as,

where 1, 1s nu   and  2, 1s nu   are the components of the relative incremental slip displacement of 
the slave node s  with respect to the closest-point-projection, along the orthogonal unit tangent 
vectors 1, 1n  and 2, 1n , respectively.  
 Similarly, the constraints satisfied by the discrete contact force vectors , 1s nf  and , 1m nf  
given by (52), can be written as,

4.4.2 Dynamic case 

For the dynamic case, a discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy conserving 

algorithm is obtained, imposing that the normal component of the slave node at the mid-point 

configuration has to be equal to the normal component of the velocity of its closest-point-

projection at the mid-point configuration, yielding,

where 1/2nn  is the outward unit normal to the closest-point-projection at the configuration at

Let us denote as , 1/2s nf  the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s  at time

From an implementation point of view, starting from the global system of linearized 

equations given in (30), the transformations of the global tangent stiffness matrix (GSM) and 

residual force vector (RFV) needed to implement the direct elimination method for the 

frictionless contact problem can be summarized in the following steps which have to be carried 

out for each slave node s : 

 Step 1. Add to row m , column m  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

 Step 2. Add to row m , column gs  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

 Step 3. Add to row m , column s  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

Step 4. Add to row gs , column m  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

Step 5. Add to row gs , column s  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

Step 6. Replace row s , column m  of the GSM by the matrix

Step 7. Add to row s , column gs  of the GSM, the matrix , , 1

 Note that, following this procedure, the number of equations of the system is kept 

constant. Once convergence has been achieved, the increment of displacements , 1s nu  is 
computed in terms of , 1m nu  and , 1s nu  using either (53), for the quasi-static case, or (57)3,

Remark 3. Note that, contrary to what happens for the full stick friction case, block-symmetry of 

the resulting global tangent stiffness matrix for the frictionless case is lost due to the 

contributions of the matrices , ,k k kn n n    A A A  given in (67). Matrices 
k
n A  and 

k
n A  arise 

from the variation of the orthogonal unit tangent vectors 1,
k

n   and 2,
k

n   and note that
k T k
n n  A A , while matrix 

k
n A  arises from the variation of 

k
n N  in (65)1. Note also that, for 

linear elements the matrix kn  A 0  (see Appendix 1). Within an infinitesimal strain 
framework, those variations can be neglected and the block-symmetry of the resulting global 

tangent stiffness matrix can be preserved.

satisfied, and the discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy are conserved. 

For the dynamic case, once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been 

updated, the nodal velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19). 

Once the displacements have been updated, the contact status has to be checked out in 

order to decide if it has to be keep as active or if it has to be deactivated for the next step. The 

contact will be still active if the contact normal force ,:nN s n nf      f n  satisfies the following 
condition: 
 

  , , 1 , 1: , 0nN s n n s s n gs n nf             f n g u u n  (77) 
 

Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s  has to be 
deactivated for the next time step. 
 

4.5 Finite element implementation of the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems 

The direct method proposed in this work is relatively easy to implement into a FE code. A 

detailed description of the matrix operations needed to be carrried out for the full stick frictional 

case and the frictionless case has been given above in a step-by-step procedure. The finite 

element formulation and direct elimination algorithm for quasi-static and dynamic analysis of 

full stick friction and frictionless contact problems have been implemented in an enhanced 

version of the finite element code for structural analysis RamSeries [48]. Figure 2 shows a flow 

chart of the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems.

or the ill-conditioning of the system, are fully avoided. Furthermore, drawbacks linked to the 

Lagrange multipliers method, such as the need to dynamically expand the system of equations, 

adding new equations for the Lagrange multipliers, are also bypassed. Remarkably, the contact 

constraints are easily imposed by a number of transformations applied to the tangent stiffness 

matrix and residual vector of the problem without contact constraints. For contact dynamic 

problems, a conserving implicit time stepping algorithm has been presented and it has been 

shown that it preserves the conservation of the same properties (linear momentum, angular 

momentum and energy) exhibited by the continuum. 

 The performance of the contact formulation has been shown in a number of 

representative examples. It is well known that node-to-segment (NTS) based contact 

formulations, as the one shown here, do not pass the contact patch test. Nevertheless, the results 

obtained in the contact patch test show a convergence to the exact solution as the mesh is 

refined and the ratio between the master size elements and slave size elements increases. An 

assessment of the formulation has been performed in the analysis of two quasi-static benchmark 

tests. A very good correlation between numerical results obtained in this work and analytical 

(Hertz contact test) or numerical results, obtained with Abaqus and Marc FE codes, using the 

penalty method (punch test), has been obtained. Finally, an assessment of the conserving 

implicit time-stepping algorithm is shown in the numerical simulation of a dynamic contact 

problem. The impact of two rigid bodies is considered and it is shown that discrete linear 

momentum, angular momentum and total energy are conserved. 

 As a final concluding remark, we would like to point out that despite the fact that over 

the last decade an important effort has been done looking for contact formulations which had as 

a design target the requirement to pass the patch test, those formulations usually imply an 

important additional computational cost, while node-to-segment (NTS) contact formulations can 

still provide very good results, being competitive for many engineering applications.
