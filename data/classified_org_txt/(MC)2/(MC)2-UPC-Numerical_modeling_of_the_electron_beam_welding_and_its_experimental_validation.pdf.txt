Electron Beam Welding (EBW) is a highly efficient and precise welding method increasingly used within
the manufacturing chain and of growing importance in different industrial environments such as the
aeronautical and aerospace sectors. This is because, compared to other welding processes, EBW induces
lower distortions and residual stresses due to the lower and more focused heat input along the
welding line.

This work describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the EBW process as well
as the experimental work carried out to calibrate and validate it.

The numerical simulation of EBW involves the interaction of thermal, mechanical and metallurgical
phenomena. For this reason, in this work the numerical framework couples the heat transfer process to
the stress analysis to maximize accuracy. An in-house multi-physics FE software is used to deal with the
numerical simulation. The definition of an ad hoc moving heat source is proposed to simulate the EB
power surface distribution and the corresponding absorption within the work-piece thickness. Both heat
conduction and heat radiation models are considered to dissipate the heat through the boundaries of the
component. The material behavior is characterized by an apropos thermo-elasto-viscoplastic constitutive
model. Titanium-alloy Ti6A14V is the target material of this work.

From the experimental side, the EB welding machine, the vacuum chamber characteristics and the
corresponding operative setting are detailed. Finally, the available facilities to record the temperature
evolution at different thermo-couple locations as well as to measure both distortions and residual
stresses are described. Numerical results are compared with the experimental evidence.

1. Introduction

Electron Beam Welding (EBW) is a fusion welding process in
which a beam of high velocity electrons is applied to the materials
being joined. The work-pieces melt as the kinetic energy of the
electrons is transformed into heat upon impact.

In an electron beam system the electron emission originates
from a negatively charged filament: the cathode. When heated up
to its thermionic emission temperature, this filament emits elec-
trons. These electrons are accelerated by the electric field between
a negatively charged bias electrode (located slightly below the
cathode) and the anode. They pass through the hole in the anode
and are focused by an electromagnetic coil to a point at the work-
enti).

piece surface (see Fig. 1a). The beam currents and the accelerating
voltages employed for typical EBW vary over the ranges of 50–
1000 mA and 30–175 kW, respectively.

Typically, the EBW system used in manufacturing operates in a
vacuum environment providing protection against oxidation and
removing gas molecules to guarantee a stable electron beam
emission. Moreover, electrons are scattered when they hit air
molecules so that the lower is the ambient pressure, the less is the
scattering. As a consequence, the beam diameter reduces by
decreasing the ambient pressure and its power can be focused in a
very small spot area in the range of 0.3–0.8 mm and the resulting
power density can be as high as 1000 W/m2.

The resulting weld is very narrow and the high energy density
allows for quick travel speeds. Therefore, the welding process
occurs so fast that the adjacent material does not absorb the
exceeding heat, leading to a minimal heat affected zone.

On the one hand, in the case of thin plates, the welding process
is induced by the material melting within the welding pool

throughout the thickness of the joint. On the other hand, when a
deeper penetration is required, the high power density of the EB
leads to the vaporization of the material, producing the, so-called,
keyhole throughout the thickness of the specimen (see Fig. 1b).
The material flow in the molten-pool around the electron beam
closes the gap of the welding joint and the following coalescence
process produces the fusion weld.

Numerical modeling of welding processes has proven to be
highly efficient for design and production engineering [25,33,27–
29,16]. In comparison with experimental studies, numerical
simulation can give detailed information concerning the char-
acteristics of the welding pool, the size of the heat affected zone
and the final distortions and the induced residual stresses
[17,18,30] and, particularly, their relationship with the welding
process parameters such as the welding speed, the EB power, and
the spot size [26,34]. Hence, the experimental work can be
reduced as well as the trial-and-error loop necessary to optimize
the final manufacturing process.

Sections 2–5 describe the FE framework for the thermo-
mechanical analysis of the EBW process including a detailed
description of the power source induced by the EB as well as the
constitutive model suitable for the entire temperature range, from
room temperature to the fusion temperature of the material. In
Section 6, the research equipment available at the Beijing Aero-
nautical Manufacturing Technology Research Institute (BAMTRI) is
presented. The experimental campaign carried out to calibrate the
numerical model is illustrated in Section 7. Also, the simulation
tool is assessed by analyzing an industrial component, part of the
AIRBUS door frame.
2. Heat transfer analysis

Both the solidification and the cooling phases are controlled by
the balance of energy equation. This governing equation can be
stated as:

_H ¼ �∇ � qþ _Q þ _Dmech ð1Þ

where _H is the enthalpy rate (per unit of volume), q is the heat
flux, while _Q and _Dmech represent the heat source (per unit of
volume) and the thermo-mechanical dissipation rate (per unit of
volume), respectively.
Please cite this article as: M. Chiumenti, et al., Numerical modeling of
Elem. Anal. Des. (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.finel.2016.07.003i
For the welding process, the heat source is the power input of
the EB through the thickness of the component. A detailed
description of this heat source is presented in the following sec-
tion. The thermo-mechanical dissipation can be neglected in front
of the power source of the electron beam.

The enthalpy HðT ; f LÞ is a state variable defined as a function of
the temperature, T , and the liquid fraction, f L. Hence, the enthalpy
rate in (1) results in:

_H T ; f L
� �

¼ ∂H
∂T

_T þ ∂H
∂f L

_f L ¼ C _T þL_f L ð2Þ

where CðTÞ ¼ ∂H∂T is the (temperature dependent) heat capacity and
L¼ ∂H∂f L is the latent heat released during the phase-change process.

The heat capacity is usually defined as: C ¼ ρc, the product of
the material density, ρ, and the specific heat, c.

During the phase transformation the material volume, V , can
be split into liquid and solid phases as: V ¼ VLþVS. The liquid and
solid fractions are defined as: f L ¼ VLV and f S ¼

VS
V , respectively, so

that: f Lþ f S ¼ 1. The evolution of the liquid fraction _f L or, alter-
natively, _f S ¼ � _f L defines the phase-change, that is, how the latent
heat is absorbed or released during the transformation.

Remark 1. On the one hand, the EBW induces the melting of the
material in the HAZ followed by the solidification process which
produces the coalescence of the joint. On the other hand, the
energy balance (accounting for the energy absorbed during the
melting and the energy released during the solidification) is null
and very localized in the HAZ.

Remark 2. The amount of latent heat is negligible in front of the
energy input coming from the EBW. Moreover, the Heat Affected
Zone (HAZ) is very narrow and the phase-change occurs very fast
compared to the thermal diffusion process, so that its global effect
is minor in the heat transfer analysis (see [14]).

The heat flux (per unit of surface) q is computed as a function
of the temperature gradient through the law of Fourier as:

q¼ �k∇T ð3Þ

where kðTÞ is the (temperature dependent) thermal conductivity.
Due to the high conductivity of the metallic materials, the thermal
diffusion process is the key mechanism to form the welding joint,
driving both the solidification and the cooling phases through the
thickness of the body and particularly in the molten-pool.

Let V be an open and bounded domain in Rndim where ndim is the
number of dimensions of the space, closed by the smooth boundary
S¼ ST [ Sq where the corresponding boundary conditions are defined
in terms of either prescribed temperature on ST or prescribed heat flux
on Sq. Suitable initial conditions for the transient thermal problem are
defined in terms of initial temperature field: T t ¼ 0ð Þ ¼ To.

The resulting weak (integral) form of the energy balance
equation (1), used for the heat transfer analysis, can be written as:Z

where δT are the variations of the temperature field, compatible

If the welding process is used to join small thickness samples,
the prescribed heat flux, q, defined in (5), can be used to apply the
EB power input on the welding joint surface.

Taking into account that the EBW process is (usually) per-
formed into a vacuum chamber (around 10�6 bar), the heat flux
by convection, qconv, can be neglected. Hence, the radiation heat
flux, qrad, is the most important condition to dissipate the heat
through the body surfaces and particularly at the HAZ, due to the
high temperature field induced by the welding heat source. The
radiation heat flux can be computed using Stefan–Boltzmann's law
as a function of the surface temperature, T , and the room tem-
perature, Tenv, as:

qrad ¼ σradεrad T4�T4env
� �

ð6Þ

where σrad is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and εrad is the
emissivity parameter, respectively.

Remark 3. The radiation heat flux out of the HAZ can be neglec-
ted. This means that its global effect could be considered by

modifying the efficiency parameter of the heat source (see next
section) without loss of accuracy in the simulation.

Finally, the heat loss due to the heat conduction process
between the component and the clamping system, qcond, can be
taken into account using Newton's law as:

qcond ¼ hcond T�Tclamp
� �

ð7Þ
where hcond is the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) by conduction
between the two materials in contact, and Tclamp is the reference
temperature of the clamping system (see [11]).

Remark 4. The HTC is defined as the inverse of the thermal
resistivity and it depends on different parameters defined at the
contact interface such as the contact pressure and the surface
roughness, among others. Considering the contact between
metallic materials, the value of the HTC is very high, around 2000–
3000 W/m2 K. Hence, Newton's law can be replaced by prescribing
the temperature at the corresponding contact surface, ST as:
T ¼ Tclamp.
3. EB power source

The heat source per unit of volume of the EB, appearing in the
balance of energy equation (1), is defined as:

_Q ¼ _P q r; zð Þ ð8Þ
where _P is total energy input and qðr; zÞ is the distribution function
depending on the distance, r, from the central axis of the EB and
the penetration, z, through the thickness of the work piece.

The power source is:

_P ¼ ηVI ð9Þ
where V and I are the accelerating voltage and the current
intensity, respectively, and η is the heat absorption efficiency.

There exist different alternatives for the definition of the power
distribution qðr; zÞ [33,21,31,25,23,32,21]. In this work, the EB is
characterized by a Gaussian distribution defined as:

the 95% of the energy is focused. This radius is maximum at the
top surface where roð0Þ ¼ rmax, and it reduces, according to a
parabolic function, till vanishing at the maximum penetration d, of
the EB through the weld joint (see Fig. 2a).

The proposed distribution of the power source is normalized
(its volume integral is 1) and its amplitude is maintained for each
section along the beam axis as:

4. FE modeling of the EBW process

The EBW process is modeled by applying the (ideal) power
distribution defined in (8) for a heat source which is moving along
the user-defined welding line. From the numerical point of view,
the implications derived from the space discretization (FE mesh
adopted) and the time-stepping defined for the time-integration
of the thermal (transient) problem must be considered.

The numerical simulation of this process requires an ad hoc
procedure to apply the (volumetric) heat source to those elements
affected by the EB while moving. Therefore, at each time-step of
the simulation, a searching algorithm is used to identify the ele-
ments within the HAZ.

The discrete problem is characterized by a time-step,
Δt ¼ tnþ1�tn, so that a discrete sequence of computations is
performed according to the time-marching scheme. Therefore, the
heat source does not continuously move along the welding line (as
for the continuous problem) but, instead, it is stepping from its
position at time tn to that at time tnþ1. Consequently, the power
input is intermittent along the welding line, producing a dis-
continuous HAZ. The problem can be alleviated by reducing the
time-step, to get an overlapped HAZ progression, but not avoided.

As a possible alternative, the total power input delivered within
the time-step, Δt, can be distributed to the elements belonging to
the volume affected by the EB during this interval, which has at
both ends the molten-pools at times tn and tnþ1. The upper surface
of the HAZ results in a rectangular section vEBΔt long (vEB being
the EBW speed) and rmax wide (see Fig. 2b). The section width
reduces in depth according to the parabolic evolution described
above (see [14]).

A further consideration is about the space discretization. Even if
the heat affected zone (HAZ) is discretized using a very fine mesh,
it is very challenging to have enough resolution to define exactly

the ideal volume, VHAZ, where the power input is applied.
According to the outcome of the searching algorithm, it is possible
to compute the volume, Vh

of the elements belonging to the (discretized) HAZ as:

Hence, the (volumetric) heat source is corrected as:

This correction preserves the total energy input independently
of the mesh used (see [12]).
5. Stress analysis

The mechanical problem is governed by the balance of
momentum equation. The local form, for quasi-static conditions,
can be stated as: find the displacement field, u, for given
(prescribed) body forces b, such that:

∇ � σðuÞþb¼ 0 ð14Þ
where ∇ � ð�Þ is the divergence operator and σðuÞ denotes the
Cauchy stress tensor.

The stress tensor can be split into its hydrostatic (pressure) and
deviatoric parts p and s, respectively, as:

σ u; pð Þ ¼ pIþsðuÞ ð15Þ
being p¼ 13trðσÞ and s¼ devðσÞ. This is a very convenient choice to
deal with the isochoric behavior, which is a characteristic of the
liquid phase or, more generally, when the deformations are mainly
deviatoric. This is the case when J2-plasticity models are used to
describe the constitutive behavior of metallic alloys.

This given, the local form of the mechanical problem can be re-
formulated as: find the displacement field, u, and the pressure field, p
(defined as an independent variable of the problem), such that:

where eT is the thermal deformation and KðTÞ is the (temperature

bility. Note that the mixed u=p formulation in (16)–(17) is equivalent
to the balance of momentum equation (14) but, in this split format, it

5.1. Mechanical constitutive laws

The material model chosen to simulate the constitutive beha-
vior is based on previous developments of the authors in the field
of coupled thermo-mechanical analysis for casting processes [1,6]
or welding analysis [12]. In both cases, the temperature range
varies from room temperature to very high values above the
melting point. As a consequence, the material response must
reproduce either the elasto-plastic behavior when the material is

at room temperature or the pure viscous behavior observed above
the melting point. This transition can be simulated adopting an
apropos thermo-elasto-visco-plastic constitutive model. The defi-
nition of temperature dependent material properties and, parti-
cularly, the thermal softening induced by the temperature
dependent yield stress, allows for a gradual contraction of the von
Mises yield-surface as the temperature increases. When the tem-
perature is close to the melting point, the viscous behavior
becomes predominant, the elastic limit gradually reduces, van-
ishing when liquidus temperature is reached. As a result, a purely
viscous model is recovered for the liquid-like behavior. Hence, the
transition from the solid to the liquid-like phase is driven by the
temperature dependency of the material properties and it is forced
during the phase-change according to the solid fraction function.

Therefore, the constitutive laws suitable for all the temperature
range of the process are characterized by a J2-thermo-elasto-
visco-plastic constitutive model of the form:

where GðTÞ is the (temperature dependent) shear modulus and
KðTÞ is the (temperature dependent) bulk modulus which controls
the material compressibility.

Remark 5. During the solid-to-liquid phase-change, the solid
fraction, f S-0, while the stresses remain bounded. As a con-
sequence, both the volumetric and the deviatoric parts of the
elastic deformation vanish and the material behaves as a liquid-
like material. The (deviatoric) viscous-plastic flow is obtained from
the rate-dependent visco-plastic strain evolution law.

The total strain tensor is computed in terms of the displace-
ment field, u, as:

[1,6,12]).

5.1.2. Liquid-like phase
The liquid phase is characterized by a temperature above the

liquidus temperature: T4TL and f S ¼ 0. From Eqs. (23) and (24),
both the volumetric and the deviatoric components of the elastic
strain tensor vanish. Therefore, on the one hand, Eq. (23) reduces
to: evol ¼ eT . This corresponds to the continuity equation for mass
conservation:

On the other hand, Eq. (24) reduces to:

so that only shear (viscous) deformations occur. The yield-surface
radius defined in Eq. (34) reduces as the temperature increases till
vanishing ðR¼ 0Þ above the liquidus temperature. Introducing this
result into the evolution law of the plastic multiplier (38), a purely
viscous model is recovered:

is assumed.

elastic strains become negligible compared to the visco-plastic
deformations. Hence, the mushy phase is actually governed by the
visco-plastic flow [13,19].

5.2. Discrete and stabilized weak form of the mechanical problem

Within the framework of the standard Galerkin finite element
method, the discrete counterpart of the weak form for the mechanical
problem (21) is defined by a finite element approximationwhere both
displacement and pressure fields are taken as nodal variables. If con-
tinuous equal order linear interpolation P1P1 is used to approximate
both (discrete) spaces, then the resulting mixed u=p formulation
violates the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) compatibility con-
dition [5]. This produces instabilities in the pressure field and, conse-
quently, poor numerical performance. Stability can be achieved either
choosing u=p interpolation spaces that satisfy the LBB condition (e.g.
P2P1 elements) or, alternatively, circumventing this condition. A
possible choice consists of using a stabilization technique within the
framework of Variational Multi Scale (VMS) methods (see the original
idea in [24]). In the present work, the Orthogonal Subgrid Scale (OSS)
Please cite this article as: M. Chiumenti, et al., Numerical modeling of

stabilization technique has been adopted to stabilize P1P1 mixed u=p
elements with continuous equal order linear interpolations. The OSS
technique, originally developed to fulfil the incompressibility condition
in CFD problems (see [15]), has been exploited in the solid mechanics
context to deal with both elastic incompressibility and J2-plasticity
(isochoric) problems (see [9,8,10,2]).
6. Experimental set-up

The EB welding facilities at the Beijing Aeronautical Manu-
facturing Technology Research Institute (BAMTRI) consist of a high
vacuum electron beam welding equipment operating in 85 m3

vacuum chamber. The accelerating voltage of the electron gun is
15 kV with a nominal power of 60 kW. Fig. 3a shows the EB
welding facilities at BAMTRI.

The welding process has been carried out in accordance with
AIRBUS quality standards (AIP01-04-011-Specification for Electron
Beam Welding of Hard Metals). The joint quality has been
inspected by X-ray to discard pieces with internal cracks or
excessive porosity, meeting A-Class quality standards.

pretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.)

M. Chiumenti et al. / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 121 (2016) ∎∎∎–∎∎∎ 11
Temperature measurements have been carried out by ther-
mocouples located at different distances from the welding line
avoiding the radiation flux induced by the power source. All
measurements have been duplicated (from both sides of the
welding line) to ensure quality control. Fig. 4a shows a welding
sample with the corresponding thermocouples for the tempera-
ture measurements during the whole duration of the welding
process.

Konica–Minolta [range-7] is the 3D laser scanning system used to
measure the distortions of the different samples after cooling at
room temperature (see Fig. 3b). The measuring method consists of
a triangulation light block technique, which uses a semiconductor
laser with a wave-length of 660 nm, a resolution of 1.31 mega-
pixels (1280�1024) and a tolerance of 4 μm. The measurement
process starts by marking a grid of reference points on each sur-
face of the body. Later, the laser source is used for a three-
dimensional scanning of the body surfaces using a narrow light
plane (less than 0.4 mm wide) identifying the position of the
reference points with very high accuracy (see Fig. 4b). The mea-
surements are imported into a CAD system to compare the refer-
ence geometry with the deformed one and color-filled contour
plot can be produced and easily compared with the results coming
from the numerical simulation.

Numerical simulation of the EBW process requires the char-
acterization of the material properties to be used for the analysis
according to the constitutive model available. Their values depend
on the temperature, covering the full range from room tempera-
ture to fusion temperature (1655 °C).

In the present work, the target material is Ti6Al4V titanium
alloy. Fig. 5 shows the temperature-dependent properties used for
this alloy within the available temperature range [4,20].

Poisson's ratio used is ν¼ 0:342. The liquidus-to-solidus phase-
change is defined by a latent heat of L¼290 kJ/kg, together with the
liquidus and solidus temperatures of 1655 °C and 1605 °C, respectively.

7. Numerical results

This section describes the assessment of the in-house coupled
thermo-mechanical FE software developed for the numerical
simulation of the EBW process [7].

The results obtained in the simulation analyses are presented
in terms of temperature graphs at different points (virtual ther-
mocouples) of the structure, as well as contour-fills of both tem-
perature and distortion distributions using the in-house pre-post-
processor GiD [22]. These results are compared with the corre-
sponding measurements obtained at BAMTRI research labs.

Two analyses have been carried out: firstly, two benchmarks
are used to calibrate and validate the software in terms of thermal
(temperature evolution) and mechanical (residual distortions)
response, respectively. The two samples are very similar a part
from the boundary conditions (clamping system) and the location
of the thermocouples. They consist of rectangular titanium plates
joined together using a constant EB power source. Next, an
industrial case is presented. Two different welding configurations
are tested on a door frame component from AIRBUS to assess their
industrial feasibility.

7.1. Calibration benchmarking

The first example consists of a Titanium (Ti6Al4V) plate,
290 mm long, 104 mm wide and 10.5 mm thick. Fig. 6a shows the
FE mesh used to perform the numerical simulation. It consists of
13.846 nodes and 16.314 hexahedral elements. A finer mesh has
been used close to the welding line to be able to capture the high
temperature gradient induced by the EBW process. To capture the
mechanical distortion accurately, 5 elements have been placed
through the thickness of the plate. Mixed u/p FE technology has
been used to deal with the isochoric plastic strains induced by the
J2-plastic model adopted as well as for incompressible behavior of
the fluid-like phase.

The colored zones in Fig. 6a represent the surfaces in contact
with the clamping system which have been used to restrain the
movement of the plates. Conduction heat transfer at the contact
interface between the plate and the clamping system is con-
sidered. The heat transfer coefficient used for Newton's model is
500 W/m2 K.

The software uses an automatic time-stepping algorithmwhich
moves the heat source element-by-element (Courant's number:
Cu¼ 1). This allows for most accurate results but, at the same time,
is the more CPU-time consuming solution.

The EBW process is performed in a vacuum chamber so that the
heat flux by convection can be neglected and the heat absorbed by
the plate during the EB welding process can be evacuated by
radiation heat flux only. The emissivity coefficient used for the
radiation model is 0.8.

Fig. 7a shows the location of the 5 thermocouples used for the
measurement of the temperature evolution during the EBW pro-
cess. They are placed at 3, 3, 2.5, 4.5 and 2.9 mm from the welding
line, respectively.

Table 1 shows the welding parameters used for the experi-
mental setting. The same parameters have been assumed in the
numerical simulation to define the power source.

Fig. 8a–d compares the thermal measurements obtained by the
thermocouples 1–4 with the corresponding numerical results
obtained. There is good agreement between the corresponding
temperature graphs at all the thermocouples locations. The only
noticeable difference is in the peak temperature. This difference
depends on the thermal inertia of the thermocouples used for the
temperature recording. The smaller and the more conductive the
thermocouples are, the faster are the temperature measurements.
Observe that the difference in the peak temperature reduces when
the location is far from the welding line.

source is very much focused, affecting only the material nearby the
welding line. The key-hole shape is also shown. Temperatures in
the key-hole are much higher than the fusion temperature and
here the material is vaporized. Fig. 10a shows the resulting
microstructure after welding and it is possible to appreciate the
size and shape of the HAZ. Fig. 10b shows the corresponding HAZ
obtained through numerical simulation. Remarkable agreement is
obtained.

A second welding is performed on a similar sample and it is
used for a double-check to prove the previous measurements. The
same plate size, material and welding process parameters have
been used as for the previous case. The main difference consists of
the position of the clamping system, affecting the mechanical
response. The position of the clamping system that is the surfaces
used to prescribe the vertical movement are detailed in Fig. 6b
(color area). The FE mesh used for the numerical analysis is
identical to the previous one.

Fig. 7b shows the location of the 4 thermocouples used for the
measurement of the temperature evolution during the EBW pro-
cess. They are placed at 1.7, 3.7, 4.7 and 18.7 mm from the welding
line, respectively.

The comparison between the thermal measurements and the
corresponding numerical curves is shown in Fig. 11a–d. Once again
the agreement is noticeable.

Fig. 12a shows the final distortions after cooling. The experimental
contour-fill is obtained interpolating the out of plane ;displacements
recorded by the 3D scanning system. The corresponding numerical
result is shown in Fig. 12b in terms of z-displacement contour-fill. The
same color-scale has been used for both results. The comparison
shows a good agreement from both qualitative and quantitative
points of view. On the one hand, the result obtained through the
numerical simulation presents perfect symmetry with respect to the
welding line because the clamping prescriptions are enforced exactly.
On the other hand, the experimental result is very sensitive to the
effectiveness of the clamping system and it is clear that this is not
able to prevent the movement of the plate due to the thermal dila-
tation induced by the welding process.

7.2. AIRBUS door frame component

The selected component is a large-scale complex thin-walled
titanium structure. This component is part of the AIRBUS door
frame as shown in Fig. 13a. Fig. 13b shows the component once
isolated from the assembled structure which forms the door
frame. The welding analysis is performed through the cross-
section shown in Fig. 13c. The key point is that it exists a vari-
able thickness (2, 4 and 6 mm, respectively), making the welding
operation more demanding (see Fig. 13d).

Two different welding configurations are analyzed:
Fig. 17. Thermoco

Please cite this article as: M. Chiumenti, et al., Numerical modeling of

1. EBW process using a variable power source according to the
variable thickness of the section to be welded.

2. EBW process using a constant power source during the whole
welding operation. This process configuration is feasible by
inserting a consumable flange along the welding line. The EB
penetration and spot size correspond to the flange height and
thickness, respectively.

The first analysis corresponds to the first option, which
assumes a variable power source according to the thickness of the
titanium plate to be welded. The airframe structure has been
simplified removing the two lateral flanges. However, both length
and thickness of each section of the plate have been maintained as
in the original design of the airframe component. Fig. 14a shows
the geometry proposed for the welding analysis and the corre-
sponding FE mesh made of 24.084 elements and 33.000 nodes.

The component is made of titanium (Ti6Al4V) and the material
properties are the same as for the benchmarks. Only heat radiation
loss has been assumed: the emissivity coefficient used is 0.8 with
an environment temperature of 20 °C.

The power source parameters used for each thickness have
been obtained scaling the current intensity in Table 1. The welding
parameters used for the analysis are shown in Table 2. An effi-
ciency of 75% is assumed to account for the actual power
absorption.

In the second analysis, a 10 mm high and 1 mm thick flange has
been inserted along the welding line. Fig. 14b shows the geometry
with the welding flange inserted between the two parts to be
jointed, and the corresponding FE discretization using 28.180
elements and 38.140 nodes.

The welding process parameters are given in Table 1 and they
are the same used to calibrate the model in the benchmarking
analyses. In fact, now the EB penetrates through the full thickness
of the flange (10 mm as for the benchmarking samples) indepen-
dently of the actual thickness of the plates to be welded. Also in
this cases, an efficiency of 75% has been assumed.

Fig. 15 shows on the left-hand side 3 contour-fills which cor-
respond to 3 different time-steps of the first analysis (variable
power source), during the welding process of the 6, 4 and 2 mm
thickness plates, respectively. On the right-hand side the corre-
sponding contour-fills for the flanged option. In both cases (vari-
able and constant power source), it is possible to produce high
quality weld independently of the plate thickness to be welded.
The size and shape of the molten-pool is very similar for both
options (see Fig. 16) without appreciable differences along the
welding line as well as in the HAZ.

Fig. 17 shows the location of two thermocouples close to the
welding line for both welding configurations. The first thermo-
couple falls inside the HAZ (2 mm from the welding line), while

the second one is placed nearby (4 mm). The corresponding
temperature histories are presented in Fig. 18. The peak values as
well as the cooling times are very similar for the two welding
configurations.

From the industrial point of view, this result is very encoura-
ging, particularly when adopting the second configuration. In fact,
this option allows for either complex welding shapes or sections
with a variable thickness. The use of a (suitable) constant power
source simplifies the welding operation and the preliminary
power source calibration. Fig. 19 shows the variable thickness
section of the AIRBUS door frame component. A constant height
flange (10 mm high and 1 mm thick) is inserted along the entire
section to be welded allowing for a constant EB power source.
8. Conclusion

In this work, a FE framework for the numerical simulation of
the EBW process is presented. Apropos constitutive behavior
within the entire temperature range from room temperature to
the fusion temperature is detailed. A precise description of the EB
power source is introduced at continuum level together with the
corresponding corrections due to the FE discretization and time-
stepping scheme.

The numerical model has been calibrated and validated
through an experimental campaign carried out at BAMTRI
research labs. Experimental and numerical temperature profiles as
well as residual out-of-plane displacements are compared with

noticeable agreement. The application to an industrial case has
proved the capability of the proposed numerical tool to validate
suitable welding configurations for demanding shapes.
