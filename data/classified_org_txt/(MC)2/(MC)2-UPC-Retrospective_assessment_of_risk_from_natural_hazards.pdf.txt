RETROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO NATURAL 
HAZARDS 

C. A. Velásquez1, O. D. Cardona2, M. L. Carreño3, A. H. Barbat4 

 

Abstract. The existing disaster databases allow analyzing losses produced by previous 
events and assessing the risk to natural hazard in a similar way as the insurance industry 
does for vehicles, health, etc., if the conditions and trends are maintained. Among the 
existing disaster databases, we selected DesInventar whose vast majority of records 
correspond to “small” events; this selection is of special interest as these small events 
are often ignored because, individually, they only stroke a few assets accounting for low 
economic losses. Nevertheless, their accumulated effect can have a significant impact 
over the economic and fiscal sustainability of urban areas, regions or countries. Also, 
considering the difficulties involved in assessing risk for those small disasters, like the 
lack of general models and the elevated susceptibility to local variables of the results, 
this approach can give answers so far unavailable. The methodology herein proposed 
has been applied to the assessment of risk (in the terms of the loss exceedance curve) in 
23 countries. 

Keywords disaster risk; retrospective assessment of risk; loss exceedance curve. 

1 Introduction 

The assessment of risk due to natural hazards (e.g. landslide, volcanic, hydro-
meteorological, hurricane, drought and tectonic) is a task of special concern for the 
communities settled in hazard prone areas, for the local authorities responsible for the 
welfare of the population, for the academic community which wants to understand and 
predict the occurrence of those hazards and also for entities dedicated to improving the 
living conditions of the communities [1, 2, 3, 4]. The disasters caused by natural 
hazards undermine the capacities and resources of the affected communities. 
Furthermore, when those disasters impact recurrently the same settlements, the

reconstruction and recovering processes can be interrupted and the consequences of the 
disasters get deeper. The destruction of assets and the restriction of the capital formation 
are some of those consequences that also increase the poverty of the members in the 
affected community and reduce their capacity for adapting and handling future events. 

Extensive risk is related to small but disperse disasters (e.g. landslides, floods) which 
can occur over large areas but affecting small settlements. Modeling small disasters is a 
difficult task, especially at country level, due to the large amount of information 
required and to the susceptibility of the results to the local data (like topography or soil 
mechanics), that is, the results have a high variability over small changes of these input 
data. Even more, the exposure data will also require details only available in big cities 
but not in rural areas. Nevertheless, the effects of this extensive risk, taking into account 
their high occurrence rate, can deplete the available resources of the affected 
communities and worsen the consequences of future disasters and, therefore, financial 
strategies for their management are required [5, 6]. 

The small disasters are generally evaluated at country level by using susceptibility maps 
which indicate areas of high, medium or low risk; those maps are generated based on 
local characteristics related to the proneness of these hazards. This approach, which 
allows a better planning and land-use policies, lacks the characteristics required for a 
risk assessment; therefore it is not possible to obtain the required metrics. The most 
important and robust risk metric is the average annual loss, AAL. The AAL can be 
defined as the amount of resources required to be saved annually in order to cope with 
all the future losses over a large period of time; even so, if in the short time these 
savings are not enough, they will be compensate during future and less catastrophic 
periods. 

The study of the consequences of individual disastrous events is a complex task. The 
adequate assessment of the impact upon the economic, macroeconomic, social and 
environmental sectors requires a qualified staff, a large amount of information and 
periods of time long enough for accounting these consequences. . Usually, due to the 
complexity and the data requirements, this evaluation is performed only on catastrophic 
events that compromises consolidated economic sectors. But after a small disaster (i.e. a 
few persons or a small area affected), the governmental help is low or inexistent and it 
is the affected population that has to assist itself and reconstruct its lost assets. These 
small disasters are, in some way “invisible” to the national and in some cases even to 
the regional authorities. 

Without trying to solve all the elements of the complex task of assessing the economic 
loss caused by a disaster, the main objective of this article is proposing a simple 
methodology which allows estimating the losses at local level. This loss value is related 
to the resources that a local govern has to spend in order to cope with the replacement or 
repair of the affected assets, according to its fiscal responsibility. This model is 
necessary due to the limited amount of data available from previous disasters, especially 
in the case of minor disasters. The proposed assessment, even if hypothetical and

disasters (which can affect simultaneously a large number of elements) and were 
evaluated by a prospective approach [10].  

The objective of this article is to develop a model for retrospective assessment of natural 
hazards risk. It will allow appraise a minimum cost that a disaster had incurred over the 
affected society in a simple and replicable approach. This model assesses a minimum 
loss on each event, and also the amount of resources needed for future disastrous events 
if the current tendencies are kept. Results obtained by using the proposed retrospective 
methodology are finally presented for several countries. 

2 Disaster databases 

Recording the consequences of past events, including cause and location, allows 
depicting a general image of areas prone to natural hazards and the severity of the 
different phenomena involve; and, at the same time, it allows the study of important 
volumes of information highly relevant for hazard and risk studies, avoiding the lengthy 
and expensive process of manually searching and retrieving those consequences for 
each one of the studies and reports available at the considered area. Unfortunately, 
disasters occurred a few decades ago lack the proper report of the consequences and 
require, in many cases, an extensive and expensive search over public documents. The 
availability of a disaster’s catalogue, prevent those events of been forgotten and allows 
that lessons from them could be assimilated and used in the future. 

The disaster databases do not store the complete catalogue of historic disasters; instead 
they are collecting the more complete set of events (including if possible previous but 
well documented events). This means that in the best case, there will be available a 
sample of events large enough to be studied and from which recommendations could be 
obtained. Nevertheless, it is important remembering that the information and data stored 
can have errors and requires a permanent review. 

Two databases are evaluated in this paper, based on their public availability, their 
update cycle, and the type of consequences reported. Nevertheless, there are other 
disaster databases like NatCat and Sigma, but those are not of public access, and are 
based mainly on insurance claims; this fact makes them slanted on countries where the 
insurance industry have a limited coverage. 

2.1 EM-DAT 

The international disaster database EM-DAT [12] was developed in 1988 and is 
currently updated and maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of 
Disasters (CRED) of the Université catholique de Louvain. It keeps a complete 
inventory of global disasters, which are over a specific threshold. Any event to be stored 
in the disaster database has to meet at least one of the following criteria: 

 10 o more people reported deaths, or 
 100 or more people reported affected, or 



P a g e  | 5 

 

 Have a declaration of state of emergency, or 
 Call for international assistance. 

In this disaster database, the reports from the United Nations agencies have the highest 
priority, followed by the reports of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA), governmental reports and finally the International Federation of Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). This redundancy permits a constant review of 
the disaster information and, in some cases, including events that are not attended by all 
the listed agencies. 

2.2 DESINVENTAR 

The DesInventar database has been continuously updated since its inception in 1993 by 
the non-governmental organization “Network of Social Studies in the Prevention of 
Disasters in Latin America” (LA RED). Conceived as an inventory of the disasters 
effects, that everyday affects each one of the country’s settlements. Currently two 
similar but different databases are maintained, one for the Americas countries [13] and 
one for the rest of the world [14].

This database collects the information at city/village level, and because of this 
resolution one disastrous event can be reported in several records, one per each affected 
settlement.  

DesInventar uses information from governmental entities and collaborating NGO’s but, 
due to the detail level and the small size of many events it also requires the use of other 
sources like, newspapers. The information stored in the DesInventar database requires a 
permanent review; it has been found during consecutive reviews data from 
sensationalist newspapers, official reports with inflated values and transcription errors. 



P a g e  | 6 

 

These inconsistences are generally difficult to be solved due to the lack of redundancy, 
but using statistical technics, e.g. OutLiers [15], they can be reduced. 

3 Economic loss model 

The estimation of the losses induced by a disaster is a complex task that requires 
specialized staff, a large amount of data and enough time to process the different effects 
over the society. The ECLAC handbook [16] is a comprehensive guide that studies the 
disaster impact over social and economic sectors, the infrastructure, the environment the 
employment and income and the macroeconomic variables. Evaluating the economic 
effect of hundreds or thousands of records included in a disaster database requires the 
use of a methodology different than the ECLAC handbook or similar; it requires a 
simpler methodology easily replicable and quick, which only considers the effect of the 
disasters upon the public and vulnerable sectors. For this, a review of the elements that 
are affected commonly during a disaster and are usually reported has to be done. 

The proposed loss model is based on the assumption of the fiscal responsibility of the 
local government toward the more vulnerable and fragile society sectors, because it 
shares some blame (due to the lack or inadequate building codes, the lack of building 
controls, the inadequate protection of the infrastructure) or because it is mandate by the 
country laws. Although the definition and scope of the fiscal responsibility varies 
between countries [17], for this paper it will be defined as the government solidarity 
after the disaster with the vulnerable population; consequently the vulnerable population 
is defined as the social sector that does not have the resources to overcome the event. 

The estimated loss will be the disaster minimum cost upon the society, taking into 
account only social elements. That is, a destroyed house will be replaced by a social 
housing solution even if the original one has other characteristics. This limitation is, in 
part, due to the reported data, in which only generic information is gathered; and is also 
based on the fiscal responsibility idea, according to which the replaced item will be a 
social element with the minimum requirements available. 

The objective of the proposed methodology is establishing the minimum cost that a 
disaster had incurred over the affected society in a simple and replicable approach. 
Therefore, this methodology cannot be compare with more robust methodologies in 
which several sectors are study in detail. This model assesses a minimum loss on each 
event, and also the amount of resources needed for future disastrous events if the current 
tendencies are kept. 

3.1 Assumptions 

The following assumptions are made for the proposed economic loss model: 

 Only elements that could be considered as fiscal responsibility will be included 
(e.g. houses, health centers, schools and roads). 



P a g e  | 7 

 

 The destroyed houses will be considered as total loss, it means, the full element 
will be replaced. 

 For the damaged houses a mean value of 25% will be used. It means that, in 
average repairing four (4) damaged houses will cost the same as building a new 
one. 

 The replacement value of the different elements will not include the cost of the 
building site. The current building area could be reused, or the government 
could assign a new area for these elements. 

 The model will not include indirect costs (e.g. shelter, demolition and hauling), 
neither macroeconomic losses. 

 The model will not include the value of the belongings, equipment or any kind 
of element different from the construction. 

 Losses over crops and cattle belonging to vulnerable population, which in some 
cases could be object of relief policies, will be ignored. This limitation is due to 
the difficulty of filter the reported disaster impact of vulnerable sectors from the 
one of industrial and wealthy sectors, the lack of detailed reports that allow 
knowing what was lost (i.e. only the total area of crops affected is reported) and, 
finally, because the economic loss is function of the type of element (crop/cattle) 
and the stage at the productive cycle on which they are at the moment of the 
disaster (i.e. the loss is different when planted than when is ready to harvest). 

 The model will not include the damage upon forests, because often it is the 
nature the one in charge of reforesting the burned area. 

 The only damage to infrastructure considered in the model will be the damage to 
roads. This is due to the difficulty of assessing the replacement cost of other 
infrastructure elements in which costs are dependent on the element 
characteristics (for example, in the case of bridges costs depend on their length, 
elevation, etc.). 

 The model will not consider human affectation. There are technical and moral 
issues regarding those fields. 

 The calculated economic loss will be expressed in US Dollars. This will be 
useful for review and comparison among different countries.  

3.2 Economic valuation of houses 

To assess the effect of disasters on houses, it is required to define the cost and 
characteristics of a basic unit. The replacement and reparation cost of the houses 
damaged or destroyed by the disaster will be based upon a single family social housing 
unit, although the social housing characteristics have changed over the years and are 
different from country to country. In most cases the definition of what a social housing 
solution is not stated and it is left to the social welfare agencies criteria (e.g. in 
Colombia, before 2004, was the internal housing agency the one in charge to define the 
characteristics of the social housing solutions; after, a governmental decree defined the 



P a g e  | 8 

 

basic characteristics for this classification); furthermore their characteristics change 
among agencies and among countries. 

Table 2Table 2 shows different values of area and cost for single family social housing 
units in some Latin-American countries. The data has been retrieved from laws or 
decrees of several Latin American countries, social welfare agencies publications and 
architectural books related. The reported areas are, in most cases, for non-developed 
units what means that an expansion (e.g. second story) could be built in the future.

* MWM: Minimum monthly wage. 

The 2003 ECLAC handbook [16] was aware of the complexity of the problem of 
correctly assess the houses worth, because of the large number of typologies, sizes, 
materials, and others elements related to the houses; and recommend the use of the 
monthly minimum wage as an indicator for the cost of the damaged houses, making it 
equal to the cost of one square meter of construction. It can be noticed in Table 2Table 2 
how several countries relate the price of the social housing with the minimum wage; 
this relation takes into account the purchasing power of the population for which these 
policies are designed and allows certain flexibility in the cases where the cost of the 
building area could be an important factor. 

Social housing area 

Table 2Table 2 shows the different areas of social housing solutions and how those 
areas have changed over time. For this model, we will assume the area of an individual 
unit of 45 m², taking into consideration that the values of 32m² and 35m² are for non-
developed units, and that the population density obtained with the proposed area is 
between 15 and 9 m²/inhabitant for families with 3 to 5 members. 

Value per area unit 

To define the economic value for the replacement of a damaged house, we require a 
replicable methodology on which the basic data could be easily acquired. Taking into 
account that indicators (e.g. minimum wage) are not available for all the countries and 
that, furthermore, those can change internally between regions, cities or in the case of 
the minimum wage upon the related activity. We will employ the Gross Domestic 
Product per Capita (GDP per capita) for estimating the economic value per square meter 
of construction. To find the relation between the GDP per capita and the area unit of 
social housing constructions we use the “Global Construction Cost and Reference 
Yearbook” [28]. Figure 2Figure 1 shows the relation for 93 countries between the 



P a g e  | 9 

 

minimum costs of construction per unit area reported in the yearbook and the GDP per 
capita [29] which have a correlation (R²) of 59% with the best fitting line; the same 
exercise using the construction minimum wage [28] has a correlation of 40.7% with the 
corresponding best fitting line. 

 
Figure 2 GDP per capita and construction cost relation, using data from 93 countries. 

The best fitting line, its equation and correlation with the data is also plotted. 

Figure 2Figure 2 does not show a clear tendency. Therefore, we repeat the exercise 
using only the countries reporting social housing construction, using a smaller sample of 
16 countries and not the initial sample of 93 countries. Figure 3Figure 2 shows the new 
analysis, between the construction cost per unit area and the GDP per capita, on which a 
correlation of 85.7% with the best fitting line is obtained, for the case between the 
minimum wage a correlation of 80% with the best fitting line was obtained.

Finally, a factor considering the cost of the construction area preparation (i.e. the cost 
related to domestic utilities, roads, sidewalks and parks) is included; this factor was 
calculated using a small sample of data from the national planning bureau (DNP) of 
Colombia, obtaining a mean factor of 40%. This value will be assume, because it is a 
function of several factors (like topography, number of units, distance to the utilities 
network, distance to the supplies, etc.) which cannot be considered with the necessary 
detail. 

3.3 Economic valuation of schools and health centers 

The schools and health centers are usually defined by their services to the community 
(i.e. primary and/or secondary education, first aid, small clinic, city or regional hospital) 
but not by the building constructed area. In order to consider the effect of the disasters 
over those elements, the model requires setting a minimum area, required by each of 
those elements to perform its social function. The area herein defined is will be 
multiplied by the construction value per square meter previously obtained for the social 
housing units. 

For the scope of the present methodology, and taking into consideration the social 
function of these buildings, its assume that, if the construction has been destroyed or 
damaged by the disaster, it will be reconstructed on a less hazard prone area; thus, the 
cost of the replacement of the element will be the total asset value. The model will not 
consider the supplies and equipment, only the direct cost of the building.  

Table 3Table 3 shows the assumed minimum elements that a basic school will require 
for fulfilling its social function. Correspondingly Table 4Table 4 shows the minimum 
elements for a basic health center.

3.4 Economic valuation of roads 

For the cost of roads, we will use the information from the World Bank project: 
ROCKS (“ROad Costs Knowledge System”) [30]. This project has collected data from 
over 40 countries and, among other items, it includes at global and regional level the 
following costs: construction, improvement and rehabilitation. ROCKS [30] database 
reports the costs in USD corresponding to the year 2000; thus a correction is require, 
which is included in Table 5Table 5. 

Table 5 Inflation rate correction for USD [31] 

Year 2000 2010 2011 2012 2013 
 1.00 1.27 1.31 1.33 1.35 

To determinate the average national cost of a road per length unit, we require the 
percentage of participation of the different materials in the country’s total. The World 
Bank Indicators System [32] only gives the percentage of asphalted roads against the 
total length by country; to be conservative with the costs the model considers that gravel 
roads are the complementary part. For the cases in which there is not an available value 
for the indicator [32] for the evaluation year, the most recent reported value will be 
used. Table 6Table 6 and the Figure 4Figure 3 display the cost of road reconstruction 
per kilometer for the world and several continents [30].

4 Methodology for the retrospective assessment of risk  

The different steps for the assessment of the economic losses caused by disasters are 
given below. Using this assessment, the losses due to previous disasters can be obtained 
and also their effects can be measured. The effect of the disasters, in particular of the 
small and frequent ones, has severe consequences for the development and the poverty 
level of the affected communities. 

4.1 Database selection 

There are two disaster databases that have the required characteristics: EM-DAT [12] 
and DesInventar [13, 14]; but there are important differences, that make them more or 
less suitable for the proposed model. The consequences threshold required for the 
recording, the number of fields used to describe the effects, and the geographic level 
upon which the disaster effects are recorded are some of the differences between the 
databases; but these are also the main characteristics required by the proposed model, 
therefore the DesInventar disaster database was selected as the most suitable for 
performing the proposed analysis. Table 7Table 7 and Figure 5Figure 4 show the 
number of records for a specific country available in each of those databases; it can be 
noted that from a statistical analysis, the DesInventar database is more robust. 

Table 7 Number of records available per disaster database for Colombia 

Database Period Records 
DesInventar 1914-2011 30,761 
EM-DAT 1906-2011 228 

 
Figure 54 Records available per disaster database for Colombia 

As noted previously, the DesInventar database has fields that are in line with the 
proposed economic loss model, among which the damaged houses, the destroyed houses 
and the meters of damaged roads. Also, it must be noted that the DesInventar disaster 
database contains a high number of records with minor damages and within a large area; 
these are considered as small disasters that have occurred over rural and peripheral 
areas. Therefore the records of the DesInventar database are considered as the 
consequences of the natural hazards upon the vulnerable society sectors.

4.3 Classification and filtering of records 

Considering that there is a large number of terms that can be used to describe the actions 
of a natural hazard which materializes over a region and that those terms can differ for 
the same event among regions of the same country it is necessary to classify each one of 
the recorded events on common categories. In this way, a more straight-forward 
methodology can be proposed, that also allow the comparison of results from different 
countries. Even more, many available administrative information use nonacademic 
vocabulary. Table 8Table 8 shows the considered disaster categories; their use depends 
on the existing hazards in the study region. In this step, no cause-effect relation will be 
considered, that is, the events will be classified according to their reported cause and not 
to their trigger event (if any, in the case of triggered disasters); the next step “Event 
grouping” will handle these possibilities. 

Table 8 Natural hazards categories 

Event Description 
Tectonic Events caused by tectonic activity, like earthquakes and tsunamis. 
Landslide Events caused by slope instability (e.g. mass movements, landslide) 
Volcanic  Events originating from volcanic activity (e.g. pyroclastic flows, lava). 

Hydro meteorological Events caused by normal water cycle (e.g. Storm, hail storm, flood) 
Hurricane Extreme hydro meteorological events (i.e. tropical storm, hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons) 
Drought Events caused by low air humidity over a long period. 

Besides the events belonging to one of these categories, the DesInventar disaster 
database also includes anthropic events. Those events were discarded from the analysis 
since they are the result of human activity and their occurrence does not correspond to 
any natural process and require very specific policies for reduction and management. 

Table 9Table 9 displays the relation between the field “Cause” of the DesInventar 
records and the previously defined categories. This is not an exhaustive list, what means 
that according to the selected DesInventar database other terms could be found. The 
anthropic events have been filtered out, together with forest fires, which mostly are 
related to or caused by to human behaviors [33, 34, 35] including, but not limiting to: 
land conversion burning, discarded cigarettes, electric equipment sparks, etc. 
Nevertheless, the present methodology can be adapted to consider the effect of wildfire, 
based on local data and knowledge of their causes. 

Table 9 Cause category relation

4.4 Event grouping 

The DesInventar database registers the effects of any single event or disaster in several 
records, one for each stroked location. This means that in the case of disasters striking a 
large area (e.g. earthquakes) one event could have all its consequences spatially 
dispersed on hundreds of locations. In the case of time persistent disasters (e.g. 
hurricanes) the consequences of the event could also be temporally distant. Therefore, a 
process for identifying and merging the records related to the same disaster is required. 

Table 10Table 10 shows the time ranges for the same category records to be taken as 
caused by the same event; moreover, considering the possibility that one event could 
trigger another disaster, the table also includes a period of time between records of 
different categories on which the relation cause-effect could be assumed. The records at 
the same regional level (i.e. the records that share the same area code) which occurs 
between the time frames defined in Table 10Table 10 will be grouped together. The 
ranges displayed are provided as an example, as these values have to be defined by 
means of a more detailed analysis of the database and of the existing hazards.

4.5 Economic valuation 

For the economic valuation of the losses induced by the processed events, only direct 
losses will be considered. As explained in section 3, the calculated cost can be 
considered as the minimum resources that the local government was supposed to spend 
restoring the lost assets for social equivalent ones, in order to cope with its fiscal 
responsibility.  

Additionally to the quantitative fields accounting the consequences of the disaster (i.e. 
damaged houses, destroyed houses, schools, health centers, roads), DesInventar also 
contains logical fields, expressing if any damage can be expected over those same fields 
(e.g. has_destroyed_houses). In the cases that a logical field shows damage, but the 
corresponding quantitative field is empty (or zero) a unitary element will be assigned. 

The proposed relations of the economic valuation model are based on simplifying 
assumptions. Those are made with the best possible criteria, considering the use and 



P a g e  | 16 

 

application of the expected results. The main objective is to obtain a minimum cost of 
the previous disasters, in a simple and replicable methodology. Therefore, the current 
model is open to improvements. 

4.6 Results 

Once the economic valuation of the processed events is completed, it is possible to 
observe the overall impact of the disasters upon the society during the studied period. 
The total loss and the average annual loss (AAL) for all the events and by category are 
some of the direct results available. The obtained values can be considered as 
conservative for the effects of the disaster (due to the use of a simplified model, the 
number of fields employed and the assignation of a social replacement value). 
Nevertheless, these results are representative of the impact, especially for small and 
medium disasters which are constantly ignored by the authorities because of their 
apparently and individual low cost. Several results obtained for Colombia during the 
development of this methodology for the GAR11 report [7] are shown in the following. 

Figure 7Figure 6 shows the percentage of threatened municipalities of Colombia 
respecting to the disaster category losses.

Figure 8Figure 7 compares the losses due to the studied categories for different return 
periods. In this particular case it also shows how in the short return periods are the 
hydro-meteorological events the ones that most impact the communities and the life and 
properties of their members.

Finally, as the obtained results represent economic losses, a frequency analysis is 
possible for each of the categories of natural hazard and for all the categories. Thus, the 
retrospective or empiric loss exceedance curve is determined. This curve shows the 
historic frequency with which each loss is reached or exceeded. The loss exceedance 
curve, LEC, provides the most complete description of risk. It displays the relation 
between a given loss (usually economic) and the annual rate with which that specific 
loss will be reached or exceeded. Figure 11Figure 10 shows a LEC which correlate an 
expected loss (horizontal axis) with their estimated frequency (left vertical axis). As the 
frequency is the inverse of the return period, the loss can also be represented as a 
function of the return period (the right vertical axis).

4.7 Applications of the proposed methodology 

Some results obtained during the developing of the methodology for the GAR reports 
[7, 8] are shown in Table 11Table 11; these correspond to some American countries 
only and are shown in the Figure 12Figure 11, where it can be seen the impact (in 
absolute and relative numbers) that the disasters had. Results for other countries of Asia 
and Africa can be found in the GAR reports and in the GAR background papers [36, 
37].

The retrospective LEC is also an important result which is shown in Figure 13Figure 12 
for the studied American countries. This result allows observing the frequency with 
which small, medium and big disasters hit these countries in the past. 

 
Figure 1312 Retrospective LECs for the studied American countries 

All the performed analyses are showing the complex situation of the communities and 
treasury departments due to the natural hazards, particularly due to the small disasters, 
allowing to communities and to the corresponding agencies to understand the individual 
and cumulative effects of the natural hazards, if no change is made regarding risk 
reduction and risk management policies. 

The results obtained from the analysis represent the economic losses that the previous 
disasters produced in the affected communities, and show the amount of lost resources 
that, in the majority of the events, were replaced by the affected communities, reducing 
their adaptive capacity and their systems of production. 

These results also represent the risk due to natural hazards, in particular those 
responsible for the small disasters. The small disasters need a different approach for 
their assessment, because they are depending on local characteristics and large and

comprehensive models that account for the disperse risk over a big area will require an 
important amount of information and computational resources not yet available. 

5 Conclusions 

The possibility of assessing the effects of previous small natural disasters allows the 
identification and characterization of the natural hazards and, at the same time, allows 
accounting for their accumulated effect. The proposed methodology addresses this 
problem in a systematic way and it can be used for a broad number of records available 
from disaster databases. Nevertheless, it is important to remark that the resolution and 
the reliability of the economic evaluations are far more accurate in the individual 
analysis of events than in their collective analysis. 

Employing similitudes with the insurance industry, it is possible to correlate the 
previous damages and losses to the future risk caused by small disasters (at least at short 
term). This is particularly helpful when thinking in the complexity of modeling the 
effect of small disasters over large areas considering, among others, the amount of data, 
the spatial resolution and the susceptibility of the results. This retrospective risk 
assessment and its different metrics (i.e. the Loss Exceedance Curve or LEC and, the 
Average Annual Loss or AAL) is of special importance for small communities, which 
are the more likely to be hit by small disasters and, in many cases, are ignored by 
planning authorities. 

The proposed retrospective LEC curve is of special relevance for governments, treasury 
secretaries and international organizations. The policy makers do not calculate this 
segment of the LEC, which largely characterize the risk due to minor disasters. Even 
more, when the retrospective LEC is combined with the prospective LEC (obtained 
from a catastrophic risk assessment) it conforms the hybrid LEC [10] providing a more 
robust and comprehensive profile which can describe, simultaneously, the country’s 
extensive and intensive risk. 

The reliability of the analysis is based on the information provided by the disaster 
databases employed. Thus, there is a permanent need for reviewing and auditing the 
different database records and its information sources. Other elements like the chosen 
variables, the replacement items and their cost could be improved in country specific 
assessments.
