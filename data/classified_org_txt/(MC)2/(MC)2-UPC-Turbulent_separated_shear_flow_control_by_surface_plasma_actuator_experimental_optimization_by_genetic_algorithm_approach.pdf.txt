Abstract 
The potential benefits of active flow control are no more debated. Among many others applications, flow control 

provides an effective mean for manipulating turbulent separated flows. Here, a non-thermal surface plasma 

discharge (dielectric barrier discharge) is installed at the step corner of a backward-facing step (U0=15 m/s, 

Reh=30000, Reθ=1650). Wall pressure sensors are used to estimate the reattaching location downstream of the 

step (objective function #1) and also to measure the wall pressure fluctuation coefficients (objective function 

#2). An autonomous multi-variable optimization by genetic algorithm is implemented in an experiment for 

optimizing simultaneously the voltage amplitude, the burst frequency and the duty-cycle of the high voltage 

signal producing the surface plasma discharge. The single-objective optimization problems concern alternatively 

the minimization of the objective function #1 and the maximization of the objective function #2. The present 

paper demonstrates that when coupled with the plasma actuator and the wall pressure sensors, the genetic 

algorithm can find the optimum forcing conditions in only a few generations. At the end of the iterative search 

process, the minimum reattaching position is achieved by forcing the flow at the shear layer mode where a large 

spreading rate is obtained by increasing the periodicity of the vortex street and by enhancing the vortex pairing 

process. The objective function #2 is maximized for an actuation at half the shear layer mode. In this specific 

forcing mode, time-resolved PIV shows that the vortex pairing is reduced and that the strong fluctuations of the 

wall pressure coefficients result from the periodic passages of flow structures whose size corresponds to the 

height of the step model. 

I. Introduction 
The aeronautic industry faces huge challenges to reach the technical recommendations of national and 

international advisory research panels. Among them, the reduction in fuel consumption and radiated 

noise are two recommendations leading to strong expectations for the future, but these 

recommendations require the definition of innovative techniques. Flow control devices are potential 

options for simplified aerofoil design and manipulation of turbulent separated flows while maintaining

high aerodynamic performances and low noise emission. Many types of active flow control systems 

have been defined in the last ten years [1], but depending on the flow conditions they have to be fully 

optimized in terms of geometry, distribution and operation to reach their better level of control 

authority. In many situations, the optimal command can be easily defined by in-lab experiments 

simply by prospecting on the best forcing conditions by a large parametric study. However, when the 

number of parameters for the command is increasing, a simple parametric study is time-consuming 

and in most of the case, such an approach is not fully effective. Furthermore, in case of a non-linear 

flow response with several minima or maxima, simple techniques such as gradient-based approaches 

can fail to identify a global optimum in particular if the initial point is not well chosen [2-3]. A 

solution for multi-parameter optimization is the evolutionary algorithm method that has a smaller 

propensity to converge toward  a local optimum when a global optimum is expected, and that can be 

constructed for solving by experiment multi-parameter research problems as originally defined in 

Rechenberg [4]. Solving optimization problems using evolutionary algorithms can determine the best 

design or decision for a single objective function or can find a set of solutions which are superior to 

the rest of solutions in the search space in case of multi-objective optimization (pareto-optimal front). 

Such a technique is able to find global extremum even in complex functions with many local maxima 

or minima. When solving a fluid dynamics optimisation problem, numerical simulations are often used 

instead of experimental analysis software due to their lower cost, lower noise in the data and the 

complete information on the flow to feed the optimizer. Many studies have been devoted to the 

optimization of aerofoil shape according to specific needs [5-6], but numerical optimization can also 

find new relevant applications in the enhancement of active flow control systems. This type of 

optimization follows the recommendation provided by Gad-El-Hak in its famous book [7] where the 

author identified evolutionary algorithms as powerful tool for the control of fluid flow. Recently, 

evolutionary approaches have been implemented in computational fluid dynamics in order to solve 

multi-criteria optimization problem. These evolutionary algorithms are a stochastic optimization 

techniques mostly based on the principle of genetics with selection by ranking and design space 

exploration accomplished by mutation and crossover operators [8].

Among several applications, genetic algorithms have been used in combination with CFD for 

optimizing aerodynamic shapes of high lift multi-elements aerofoil by multi-point adaptation [9-10]. 

Flow control optimizations have also been reported by combining evolutionary algorithms and 

numerical simulations. In Hilgers and Boersma [11], the spreading of a turbulent jet is optimized by 

Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) regarding the forcing mode and frequency in the initial region of 

the free shear layer. DNS has also been used for reducing the skin friction on the turbulent wall of a 

channel flow [12]. The optimal forcing by suction/blowing jet on the upper surface of a NACA0012 

aerofoil has been numerically determined in [13]. The problem of time-averaged drag minimization 

for flow past a circular cylinder has been addressed in different publications [14-15]. Recently, a 

NSGA-II code has been numerically applied to optimize the flow reattachment along a NACA0015 

aerofoil by simple two-dimensional plasma discharge model [16]. In this paper, four design variables 

and six objectives functions were optimized in order to improve the performances of the aerofoil in 

post-stall incidence by using DBD actuator. This complex optimization problem finally leads to the 

definition of a ‘safe’ region of the design parameters. 

Such fully numerical procedures become extremely expensive as the number of geometry 

parameters is increased. The limitation due to the computational time cost is regularly pointed out, 

restricting the method to an approximated evaluation of the objective function or limiting the 

investigations to low Reynolds numbers. In fact, evolutionary algorithms were initially defined to be 

used in an experimental context [4]. In its earlier applications, the iterative process of optimization by 

evolutionary algorithm was implemented experimentally by modifying manually the geometry of a 

two-phase flow model in 1970 [17]. Now, experimental optimization is often referred as Hardware-In 

the-Loop (HIL) method. Indeed, because evolutionary algorithm only requires the evaluation of the 

cost function regarding a set of control parameters, such an algorithm can be used in conjunction with 

experimental measurements. Such a coupling between a numerical solver and  wind-tunnel tests has 

been recently introduced in the experimental flow control community as a convenient way to reach 

optimal control conditions in autonomous manner (autonomous experimental optimization as named 

in [18]). Complex application as the experimental design-optimization of a flapping wing (NACA 



4 

 

 

0012 equipped with eight actuators to modify its geometry) in order to maximize the produced lift has 

been proposed in [18]. Active wing morphing has also been investigated in [19] where a two-point 

optimization design is conducted by interfacing an evolutionary genetic algorithm with a sting balance 

supporting the wing model in a wind tunnel. Recently, the influence of a flow control system based on 

dielectric barrier discharge has been optimized by NSGA-II algorithm in a multi-objective 

optimization approach [20]. Indeed, the autonomous experimental optimization proposed in [20] 

simultaneously maximizes the lift coefficient estimated by time-averaged pressure measurements and 

minimizes the electrical power consumed by the actuator. The results are analysed by regarding the 

trend of the global solutions as well as by inspecting the non-dominated solutions of the multi-

objective optimization problem. This elegant approach demonstrates the contribution of each of the 

design variables on the lift recovery. In [21], the lift production and drag reduction caused by two 

plasma actuators on the opposite sides of a circular cylinder have been simultaneously optimized 

regarding four design variable including the phase delay between both independent actuators. The 

genetic algorithm is used to build a Kriging surrogate model that can find effectively a global 

optimum. The approach reveals the role of the duty-cycle and the modulation frequency for achieving 

the multi-objective optimization. Evolutionary algorithms can also open new exciting directions for 

optimization or for manipulating turbulent flows. For instance in [22-23], the best control law can be 

obtained by a model-free approach based on genetic programming methods. This approach, called 

machine-learning control, can find a control law depending on the local [22] or global [23] flow 

conditions in order to minimize or maximize objectives functions selected in regard to the studied 

case. For instance in [22], the authors find the best control law for minimizing or maximizing the 

turbulent energy and the spreading of a turbulent mixing layer. The results are compared to an open-

loop test campaign and confirm the effectiveness of machine-learning to optimize one parameter of the 

actuator (in the present case the excitation frequency) at a reduced cost time. 

The present investigation concerns an experimental turbulent confined flow separation scenario. 

Indeed, the flow separation downstream of a backward-facing step (BFS) has been selected as the flow 

configuration to be optimized. This configuration is well-adapted for defining unsteady flow control 



5 

 

 

approaches because the flow behind a BFS presents a large variety of periodic motions that can be 

manipulated. The actuator is based on a surface dielectric barrier discharge [24-26] operated by 

applying an AC high-voltage to the air-exposed electrode of the actuator as in [20-21]. Plasma 

actuators are based on electro-mechanical conversion principle that implies fast energy transfers. By 

adjusting the electrical parameters of the electrical signal applied to the air-exposed electrode, the 

amplitude, frequency and duty-cycle of the periodic flow fluctuations induced by the plasma discharge 

can be easily tuned [27] and feed the genetic algorithm optimizer. In the present investigation, a 

genetic algorithm is used instead of a gradient-based approach simply because the flow response map 

to a DBD forcing has already been conducted in [28] and it was shown that the flow response is not 

monotonous as it presents several minima. Furthermore, the proposed method couples a numerical 

optimizer to a wind-tunnel experiment leading to an autonomous experimental optimization, an 

approach rarely presented in the recent literature. Single-objective genetic algorithm that solves multi-

design variables optimization problem is implemented in a feedback loop. Here, the three design 

variables (voltage amplitude, modulation frequency and duty-cycle) are simultaneously optimized to 

finally determine a trio of optimal values for minimizing the mean reattachment location or for 

maximizing the wall fluctuating pressure coefficients, depending on the single-objective function to be 

optimized. Finally, time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are conducted for 

the best parameters identified from the genetic algorithm method in order to highlight and detail the 

physical phenomena behind the optimal forcing conditions. 

II. Experimental setup 
The experiments are conducted in a closed-loop wind-tunnel having a moderate turbulent intensity 

(0.8%). The dimension of the test section is 300x300x1000 mm3. The model covers the full spanwise 

of the test section and has a height of 30 mm. The aspect ratio (channel width on step height) is larger 

than 10 to minimize the side-wall influence on the flow in the centre of the wind tunnel. All 

measurements are performed for a free-stream velocity of 15.6 m/s (Reh=30000). A zig-zag turbulator 

with thickness of 300µm is installed 10h upstream of the step corner in order to guarantee a fully 

turbulent boundary layer at the separation point. In a past experimental campaign [29], the inlet flow 



6 

 

 

conditions have been detailed by two-components LDV. At the step corner, the boundary layer 

thickness is 14 mm and the momentum thickness is 1.65 mm (Reθ=1650) for a H factor of 1.6. 

 The model has been designed to accommodate the plasma actuator with minimal influence on the 

incoming boundary layer. The step model includes an internal cavity for placing the grounded 

electrode while the air-exposed electrode (black-painted aluminium with total thickness of 60 µm) is 

placed on the opposite side of the model. The air-exposed and the grounded electrode have a width of 

15 and 10 mm respectively and the gap between them is fixed at 2 mm. The model made of PMMA 

serves as dielectric barrier with a thickness of 3 mm.   

 

 

Figure 1 : Sketch of the DBD plasma actuator with details on electrode arrangement and co-ordinate system used in 
the paper. 

The plasma discharge is produced by amplifying the ±10 V signal of a PXI card (NI, PXI-5402) 

with a high voltage power amplifier (TREK® model 30/20A). This amplifier generates a maximum 

output voltage of +/- 30 kV (tension gain 3000V/V) and a maximum output current for AC peak of +/-

40 mA (slew rate 500V/µs). The plasma discharge is produced by a sinusoidal waveform with ac 

frequency always maintained at 2 kHz. Such continuous signal can be effective to manipulate a 

separated flow, however unsteady forcing by burst modulation is preferred in the present investigation. 

Thus, the plasma discharge is alternatively turned off and on at frequencies in the range of the periodic 

fluctuations of the natural flow by using a low frequency gate function to trigger the ac sine voltage 

(burst modulation, see [26]). Three design variables are simultaneously optimized: the voltage 

amplitude, the burst frequency and the duty-cycle considering that the driven frequency is fixed (see 

Figure 2). The voltage amplitude mainly acts on the amplitude of the mean flow produced by the 

surface discharge. The burst frequency drives the periodic excitation imposed by the discharge. The 

duty-cycle of the applied signal modifies the amplitude of the flow fluctuations produced by the 

plasma. High duty-cycle value means that the produced flow approaches steady flow conditions (i.e., 

x

small fluctuation amplitude) while low duty-cycle will emphasize the amplitude of the fluctuations but 

in this case the mean produced flow velocity is small [27]. Then, for flow control perspectives, a 

balance has to be found for producing a ‘high’ mean flow and one having ‘high’ fluctuation amplitude. 

All of these three parameters have strong influence on the performance of the control, this motivating 

for optimization studies using model free method such as evolutionary algorithm. 

 

 

Figure 2 : Illustration of the three design variables simultaneously optimized by the genetic algorithm 

 

The optimization concerns two independent objective functions, both being estimated by 

measurements of the unsteady wall pressure downstream of the backward-facing step. The first 

objective function is the location of the mean reattachment point. Here, it is estimated by the position 

XR of the wall pressure fluctuation coefficient (CP’) peak along the stream wise direction on the wall 

(Figure 3b). The procedure simply consists in recording the pressure signals on the bottom wall and in 

computing each local pressure fluctuation coefficients. Then a dedicated gradient-based algorithm 

seeks for the location of the maximal fluctuation. Determination of the location of maximum CP’ is a 

convenient and relevant way to estimate the reattachment location without direct measurement [30, 31, 

32], even if it was already observed that such method often leads to a small under-estimation of the 

real mean reattachment location [33, 34]. In order to extend the optimization to unsteady component of 

the flow, a second objective function is considered. The spatial integral of the wall pressure fluctuation 

coefficient CP’ is performed all along the bottom wall (grey region in Figure 3b). This integral is an 

estimator of the flow variations in the shear layer developing from the step corner. It is considered that 

the pressure fluctuations at the bottom wall are caused by the intensity and integral length scale of the 

vortical flow structures embedded in shear layer and the flapping character of the reattaching flow as it 



8 

 

 

is discussed in [33, 35]. Then, higher value of the CP’ spatial integral is supposed to be related to a new 

organization or amplification of the unsteady character of the separated flow. 

In order to measure the pressure fluctuations downstream of the backward-facing step, the bottom 

wall has been equipped with 32 pressure taps. These pressure taps consist of holes with 0.6-mm 

diameter distributed along the streamwise direction from x/h=1 to x/h=9. The distance between two 

successive taps is 4.5 mm resulting in a spatial resolution of 0.15h (see Figure 3a). Unsteady pressure 

sensors (12 bits) with intrinsic bandwidth of 2 kHz for max pressure of 250 Pa are used (HCLA 12X5, 

SensorTechnics, 12.5 kPa dynamic range, 0.6 Pa of resolution).  They are connected to the pressure 

taps using 350-mm long, 0.8-mm diameter Tygon tubes. The maximum error including non-linearity, 

hysteresis, and thermal drift is ±2.25% of the full-scale span. A preliminary dynamic calibration of a 

single sensor with its tube connection revealed a measurable bandwidth of 6–1200 Hz. Output voltage 

signals of the pressure sensors are recorded by a multiplexed 32 channels acquisition card (PXI-6259). 

The signal generator and acquisition cards are embedded in a PXI chassis allowing for an autonomous 

scanning of the electrical parameters while the output responses of the 32 sensors are simultaneously 

recorded. The 32 sensors are used to compute the streamwise distribution of the rms pressure 

fluctuations normalized by the inflow dynamic pressure. Then, the wall pressure fluctuations are 

presented in coefficient form: 

C�� =
�1� �	
� − 
� +

� + ⋯+

(1) 

where P0 and U0 refers to the reference value of the static pressure and streamwise freestream 

velocity, respectively. At acquisition rate of 1000 Hz, preliminary tests have shown that a correct 

estimation of the mean reattachment point requires at least 5 seconds of continuous recording in order 

to reach a converged mean location. This time is a strong limitation for real-time estimation, but it is 

intrinsic to the unsteady character of the turbulent reattaching flow in BFS configuration. Another 

limitation is that the reattachment is estimated within ±0.15h resolution due to the spatial resolution of 

the linear array of pressure sensors.

fluctuation coefficients CP’ along the bottom wall downstream the step model for U0=15 m/s (b). 

 

Time-resolved particle image velocimetry has been performed for the optimal control parameters 

identified by the optimizer. The flow is measured by a fast PIV system composed by a high-speed 

camera (Photron, APX-RS), a single head Nd:YLF high-speed laser with dual oscillator (Quantronix, 

Darwin-Duo), a triggering unit (EG, R&D Vision) and a PC running Davis V8.2 software (Lavision). 

The laser (sheet of 1 mm) is placed above the BFS at mid-span of the model to avoid lateral regions 

possibly affected by the boundary layer developing on the side wall of the tunnel. The camera is 

operated at 2000 full frames per second at 1024x1024 pixels². The flow is seeded with atomized oil 

(Ondina 15, Shell) resulting in 0.3-0.5 µm trackers. Double-frame acquisitions are performed with 

frames separated by a time delay of 90 µs. The two velocity components (-1<x/h<8, -1<y/h<1.3) are 

computed using a cross-correlation algorithm with adaptive multipass, interrogation windows of 64 x 

64 to 16 x 16 pixels and an overlap set to 50%. This results in a spatial resolution of 2.15 x 2.15 mm² 

for the vector fields. The maximum seeding particle displacement is approximately 8 pixels with a 

sub-pixel error of ±0.1 pixel, that corresponds to a minimal accuracy of ±0.2 m/s. Flow sequences of 

7.5 seconds are recorded. Acquisition starts 10 seconds after the plasma has been turned on, thus the 

transient regime is discarded from the analysis. The acquisition time is sufficiently long then all the 

time-averaged quantities (first and second order) have converged to their steady state values 

(variations lower than 5%). 

III. Description of the genetic algorithm based optimizer 
 



10 

 

 

Optimization methods define a set of tools and techniques that help engineers to solve complex 

problems optimizing an objective function while fulfilling a set of constraints. This type of problem 

can be formulated as follows: 

Maximise or minimise an objective function f depending on N� design variables subject to 
constraints: 

g�	x� = 	0	and	h$	x� ≥ 0, j	 = 	1, … , N), k	 = 	1, … , N+, (2) 

where g�	and	h$ are, respectively, the equality constraints with a total number of Ng and the inequality 
constraints with a total number of Nh. The variable x is an N� dimensional vector where its arguments 
are the design variables.  

The optimisation problem will result on a set of design variables that defines the 

Maximum/Minimum value of the objective function. Among the optimization methods available, 

evolutionary techniques and more specifically genetic algorithms are of interest on this research. 

Genetic algorithms have evolved quite quickly thanks to engineering applications. Their stochastic and 

robust character makes them very useful in complex problems where few or none information is 

available about the objective functions. In addition, they fit very well with multi-objective problems. 

The optimization strategy is inspired on the natural evolution of species, formulated by Darwin. It gets 

the optimal individuals using a combination of selection, crossover and mutation of the fittest 

individuals, which are the candidate solutions. The first implementation of GA used a chromosome 

containing the values of the input variables in the form of a chain binary-encoded, but real-coded 

genetic algorithms were firstly proposed by Selfridge [36] and later by Bledsoe [37].  

The iterative process for optimizing the forcing conditions by a genetic algorithm approach is 

illustrated in Figure 4. The procedure starts with a randomly generated population (also called 

generation), including a predefined number of individuals. Here, each generation is composed of ten 

individuals, one individual being composed of the three design variables introduced previously in the 

paper. The set of parameters of each individual is applied to the surface plasma discharge and then the 



11 

 

 

objective function (or fitness function) is evaluated. The evaluation of one individual takes 5 s due to 

the unsteady aspects of the BFS flow. Furthermore, in order to discard transient regimes the pressure 

acquisition starts 5 seconds after the plasma is turned on. To recover a natural flow regime, a period of 

5 seconds is considered after the plasma is turned off. Then, the whole acquisition process takes 15 

seconds per individual plus a few hundred of microseconds to read and write the input and output 

ASCII files. At the end of the evaluation process all individuals can be ranked according to the value 

of their fitness function. At this time, the basic operators which manage the genetic algorithm, namely 

the selection, the crossover and the mutation, are applied. The selection operator takes care of 

selecting the best performing individuals of each population to enable other operators to produce new 

offspring. It is the most basic operator and usually the first one to be applied. The most usual selection 

techniques are roulette wheel, ranking selection, and Elitism, among others. In the present 

investigation, the best individuals are selected by a ranking tournament. Crossover operator takes two 

selected individuals and it combines them to create a new offspring. Several techniques can be used to 

determine the point where the genetic information is split to add the genetic information from the 

second individual. Here, single-point crossover, the most standard techniques for crossover, is applied 

(probability of 0.9). Finally, the mutation operator creates new offspring modifying the information 

contained in one design variable of a selected individual. Bit inversion and order changing are usual 

mutation techniques for binary encoding, but here (because of real-value encoding approach) a small 

quantity is added to the design variable under mutation process. Furthermore, the mutation probability 

is set as a function of the number of design variable; it is defined as 1/3 because three designs 

variables are considered. At the end of the operator procedure, a new generation is produced and the 

iterative process starts. This iterative process finish when the stopping criterion is reached (it could be 

accuracy, time, number of iterations, etc…). Here, the genetic approach tests a total of 12 generations 

for a total running time of 45 minutes. The procedure is fully automatized and it corresponds to a 

closed-loop approach by autonomous experiment optimization. 

The selected optimizer used in this work is the Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm (SOGA) 

module in Robust Multi-objective Optimization Platform (RMOP) developed at CIMNE. Details of 



12 

 

 

RMOP can be found in references [38, 39]. This optimization platform enables the analysis of single 

and multi-objective problems using the hybridized techniques that combine Pareto-game and Nash-

games. However, in this work only the subset of tools corresponding to single objective optimization 

problems has been used and this simplified use of the optimization code is not using the parallel 

computing capabilities in order to avoid overloading the plasma actuator with more than one 

individual at the same time.

IV. Results – Optimization by GA method 
The procedure of coupling experimental sensors and actuators with a numerical optimization code, as 

an analogic solver, has been described in the previous sections of this paper. Now, the results of the 

optimization are presented regarding each of the objective functions (reattachment minimization or 

wall fluctuating pressure maximization). 

 

 
IV-1 Minimization of the reattachment location 

In this first optimization case, the reattachment length XR is the objective function of the optimization 

problem. The objective is then:  

Minimize 

,-	.//0� = min�34	.//0��	 (3) 



13 

 

 

where .//0 is the vector containing the three design variables (.5, .6, .7) of the DBD plasma 
actuator. 

The optimization problem, equation (3), is defined as a single-objective minimization problem, 

with the following definition of the lower-upper bounds search space of the three design parameters: 

- .5: Voltage amplitude (kV); V	ϵ	ℕ, 12 ≤ V ≤ 20  
- .6: Burst Frequency (,=>, in Hz);	,=>	ϵ	ℕ, 10 ≤ ,=> ≤ 300 
- .7: Duty Cycle (DC, in %); DC	ϵ	ℕ, 5 ≤ DC ≤ 95  

 

Some of the evaluations of the populations are illustrated in Figure 5. This plot shows the 

optimization process for the three design parameters. The first generation is produced randomly and 

then it covers a large search space region. However, regardless of the applied electrical parameters, all 

the evaluations indicate a reduction of the recirculating area when the surface plasma discharge 

operates. The convergence of the iterative process is clearly evidenced in Figure 5. For instance, the 

design variable corresponding to the voltage amplitude reaches its final value in only a few 

generations (see generation 7 in Figure 5Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable.), but other 

parameters such as the burst frequency need more time to converge. The mutation of the individuals 

slows the convergence rate but also insures that the best solution is found even in context of several 

local minima in the static response of the flow. 



14 

 

 

 

Figure 5 : Evaluation of the individuals of different generations for the reattachment optimization by SOGA. 

 
 The convergence of the best solution of each generation is shown in Figure 6. This plot shows how 

fast the convergence of the optimization is. After 60 evaluations (i.e., six generations), the minimized 

reattachment length is 4.55h meaning that the recirculation bubble has been reduced by 20%. This 

reduction is in agreement with [29] but larger reductions by using surface plasma actuators are 

reported in [40] or [41] in case of an initial laminar flow regime. The reduction in size of the 

recirculating flow is also similar to those obtained at similar Reh by using an oscillatory jet with a 

continuous slit exhaust [42] or an oscillatory flap [31]. At the end of the iterative optimization process, 

the best individual find by the solver corresponds to periodic forcing with voltage amplitude at its 

maximal value (i.e., 20 kV here), a duty-cycle in the 50-60% range and superimposed perturbations in 

a 120-130 Hz range. As it is shown in Figure 7 where the distribution of the design variables of the 

120 individuals are plotted, many of the individuals have design variable values around the optimal 

forcing condition due to the fast convergence rate of the method. The most effective periodic forcing 

frequency when scaled on the height of the step or the initial momentum thickness leads to Strouhal 

numbers of about Sth=0.23 and Stθ=0.013, respectively. Periodic forcing at these Strouhal numbers has 

been largely documented in literature for other types of flow control devices than the surface plasma 



15 

 

 

discharge used in the present investigation [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. For instance, Chun and Sung in [42] 

identified the optimal local forcing at Sth=0.27 (Reθ=1470, pulsed jets produced by loud speakers). In 

[43], Bhattacharjee et al. identify a 0.2-0.4 Strouhal range for which loud speaker installed on the top 

wall of the test section can minimize the recirculation bubble. By large eddy simulation, Merhez et al. 

[44] shows that the recirculating flow is reduced for sinusoidal oscillating jet positioned at the step 

edge and operated at Sth=0.25. A similar optimum frequency can be found in the wake of bluff body as 

it is shown in [45]. In fact, the separated shear layer formed downstream of a BFS evolves as a typical 

mixing layer in its earlier stage of formation with a typical ‘shear layer mode’ of instability at about 

Stθ=0.012 (where θ is the momentum thickness of the boundary layer) [46]. Forcing a separated shear 

layer with periodic perturbations at Stθ =0.013 is well known to promote a faster growing of the shear 

layer by an increase of the pairing mechanism [47]. This type of forcing corresponds to a manipulation 

of the shear layer mode of instability [48] for which a larger spreading rate results in a shortened 

reattachment.

IV-2 Maximization of the wall pressure fluctuations 

The second optimization test case problem selects the CP’ spatial integral value as the objective 

function to be improved. Thus, the optimization problem is now defined as:  

Maximize 

,-	.//0� = max	�∫ CD�	.//0��,	 (5) 

where .//0 is the vector containing the three design parameters of the plasma DBD actuator and the 
integral symbol is the spatial integration from x/h=3.2 to x/h=7.4. 

Again, the optimization corresponds to a single-objective maximization problem with multi 

design variables. These variables have the same lower-upper bounds search space than in section IV-1.

Figure 8 : Four generations of the maximization of the wall fluctuating pressure coefficients 

 

The evolution of the individuals of a few of the tested populations is shown in Figure 8. Starting 

from a population of random individuals (generation 1), the electrical parameters finally collapse to 

values covering a tiny range. At the end of the iterative process, the GA code identifies the best 

forcing conditions that maximize the wall fluctuating pressure. For periodic forcing with maximal 

voltage amplitude, duty-cycle of 50% and perturbation frequency at 65 Hz, the wall fluctuating 

pressure coefficients are maximized with an increase by 115% by comparison with the non-forced 

flow conditions. The convergence rate of the SOGA approach is lower than the one for the objective 

function related to the reattachment location, here variables of the best candidate have been found for 

the last generation (Figure 9). The optimal voltage amplitude is found from the first generations 

because this variable has a strong influence on the control authority (in fact, it drives the amplitude of 

the mean flow produced by the discharge). However, the convergence is slowed by the definition of 

the optimal duty-cycle and in a lesser extent by the determination of the best forcing frequency. As it 

is presented in Figure 9, the individuals of the total population present frequency variable within a 50-

100 Hz range and duty-cycle covering a 40-80% range. Here, the optimal forcing frequency 

corresponds to a Strouhal number Sth=0.125 (Stθ=0.006), but also to a Strouhal number based on the 



18 

 

 

reattachment location equal to StXR=0.6. This frequency corresponds thus to the frequency of the 

vortical flow structures when they impact the bottom wall [30, 35, 47]. That suggests that the best 

forcing frequency for maximizing the wall pressure fluctuations matches with the one at the end of the 

shear layer development when the dividing line curves to the bottom wall. This mode of forcing 

corresponds to the first subharmonic of the shear layer mode. Kaul recently confirmed that the first 

subharmonic of an instability wave is a dominant parameter in the development and growth rate of a 

separated shear layer [49]. However, single-frequency forcing at the subharmonic has only been 

investigated in a few publications but, in most cases, this has been conducted in a general context of 

double-frequency excitation where forcing at the fundamental and its subharmonics are considered 

simultaneously or with a phase delay [50, 51, 52]. Because double-frequency excitation is more 

effective than single-frequency due to subharmonic resonance [53, 54, 55], the case of single-

frequency excitation at the subharmonic has not been fully documented in these publications. Here, the 

GA method has identified such a forcing mode as the more effective for maximizing the wall pressure 

fluctuations in case of BFS flow configuration. This specific forcing condition will be detailed later in 

the paper.

V. Results – PIV measurements on the best forcing conditions identified by SOGA 
The optimal design variables for maximizing the pressure fluctuations or minimizing the reattachment 

location have been identified by the GA optimizer in the previous part. Now, the flow response to the 

trio of optimized parameters is detailed by a time-resolved PIV analysis. 

V-1 Mean flow quantities 

The mean velocity field normalized by the freestream velocity U0 is plotted in Figure 10 for the natural 

flow case as well as the two combinations of parameters defined from the GA code. The iso-contours 

or the representations by streamlines confirm that the actuation leads to a reduction of the recirculating 



20 

 

 

bubbles for both applied signals. From these data, the location of the reattachment point is determined 

as the point where the velocity U is equal to zero at a distance of 0.05h from the bottom wall. The 

natural flow reattaches at 5.83h downstream of the step wall. This value corroborates with the 

reattachment location extracted from the wall pressure fluctuations distribution. When the plasma 

discharge is operated at 20 kV, 65 Hz and 50% of duty-cycle (Stθ≈0.06, Figure 10B), the mean 

reattachment point is moved further upstream with a location identified at a distance of 5.12h from the 

step. For the design variables optimizing the reattachment location (Stθ≈0.013 from the SOGA code, 

Figure 10C), the mean flow reattaches at 4.55h. The flow measurements confirm the 22% reduction in 

the reattachment length due to the DBD actuator. 

The modifications caused by periodic forcing are further detailed by inspecting the evolution of 

the vorticity thickness with downstream location x/h (Figure 11). At the separating point located at the 

step corner, the vorticity thickness is small but it rapidly grows with the downstream distance. 

Regardless the presence of forcing conditions or not, a linear growing is observed up to x/h=3.5 (zone 

I in Figure 11). Beyond this location, the vorticity thickness of the natural flow stops its development 

from x/h≈3.5 up to x/h≈5.5. The stabilization of the vorticity thickness (zone II) should result from the 

completion of the merging process or because the vortices stop their development in size [56]. When 

subharmonics forcing is performed at Stθ =0.006, the shear layer stops its linear development at an 

upstream position (at x/h≈4) and the vorticity thickness is maintained at a constant value up to x/h≈5. 

The major modifications in zone II are observed when the plasma is operated at Stθ =0.013. In this 

latter case, the shear layer stops its development at a shortened distance (x/h=3) while downstream of 

this location (zone II) the vorticity thickness still increases but with a reduced rate. It is assumed that 

the reduced spreading rate of the shear layer caused by the discharge in zone II corresponds to a 

change in the growing mechanism of the fully developed shear layer compared to zone I. The 

amalgamation of adjacent vortices contributes to a larger spreading of the shear layer but the pairing of 

vortical flow structures is not the only mechanism to promote the divergence of a turbulent shear 

layer. For instance, a smaller spreading rate has been observed in the process of vortex splitting than in 

vortex merging [57]. Furthermore, the shear layer growing can also be caused by the growth of eddies 



21 

 

 

by fluid entrainment and not to the pairing mechanism as shown in Brown and Roshko [58]. 

Unfortunately, an analysis based only on mean flow quantities cannot reveal the real dynamic 

corresponding to the flow in zone II. Beyond the reattachment point (end of zone II), in all cases the 

vorticity thickness increases again due to the lateral displacement of the reattaching region (zone III).

V-2 Time-resolved analysis of the turbulent separated flow 

Here, the time-resolved fluctuating velocity v’ is extracted from the PIV fields at y/h=0.05 in order to 

analyse the temporal evolution of the separated shear layer. The presence and convection of the 

vortical flow structures is clearly evidenced by the alternations of positive and negative v’ velocity 

components and also by the orientation of the streaks shown in Figure 12. The convection velocity, Uc, 

is 0.55U0 for the natural flow and it is slightly reduced to 0.5U0 when the plasma discharge is applied. 

However, the main result from this figure is the strong regularization of the vortical flow structures of 



23 

 

 

the shear layer for a forcing at the shear layer mode Stθ =0.013. It is shown in Figure 12c that the flow 

quickly organizes in a periodic manner (from x/h=1) and it exhibits a strong periodization between 

x/h=2 and x/h=4. Furthermore, the frequency signature of the vortex street is halved past the x/h=4 

position probably due by the vortex pairing. An actuation at Stθ ≈0.006 (Figure 12b) also affects the 

flow dynamics, but its influence is not as clear as the regularization imposed by forcing at the shear 

layer mode. The amplitude of the fluctuating v’ velocity is clearly reinforced, even more than forcing 

at Stθ =0.013, but the shedding regularization is less pronounced. The flow structures increase in size 

when they are convected, but their mechanism of growing is not clear from Figure 12b. The extraction 

lines confirm the presence of oscillations in the flow with a wavelength increasing along the vortex 

street development as it was observed for the natural flow.

and 6 for the natural flow (a), periodic forcing at Stθ =0.006 (b) and Stθ =0.013 (c). 

 



24 

 

 

 Complementary to the analysis done over a short flow sequence as in Figure 12, the power density 

spectra of the fluctuating component v’ at three locations along the shear layer mean centerline are 

shown in Figure 13 by considering each complete series of flow measurements. At the beginning of 

the shear layer development (x/h=2), the turbulent energy of the baseline flow is small and no discrete 

frequency dominates. The periodic behavior of the shear layer is not fully installed at this location. 

Beyond this position, the turbulent energy is increased, but the frequency content of the turbulent flow 

is spread over a wide frequency band with maximal amplitude of the PSD observed at low frequency 

(~7 Hz, presumably the physical frequency related to the flapping of the shear layer). A small 

amplitude bump can also be observed at about 72 Hz and its first subharmonics, the signature of 

periodic events at these frequencies. 

 For flow forcing at Stθ=0.006, the shear layer presents periodic components from the earlier stage 

of the shear layer development (x/h=2) as demonstrated by the small amplitude peak at the forcing 

frequency and its two first harmonics in the PSD. Downstream of this position, a strong and sharp 

peak is observed at the forcing frequency, while only a small signature of vortex pairing is visible at 

Stθ/2. The signature at the forcing frequency is continuously amplified all along the shear 

development, this even downstream of the mean flow reattachment. As it was discussed in [56], the 

amplification of the subharmonic component occurs over a longer distance by comparison with the 

amplification of the fundamental. Here it is demonstrated that the subharmonic component is 

continuously amplified up to the reattaching region. This constant increase with only a small signature 

of pairing activity and the enlargement of the streaks in Figure 12 indicate that the growing 

mechanism of the coherent flow structures is primarily due to an entrainment process. This is further 

confirmed by the time-resolved velocity flow fields depicted in Figure 14. By plotting the vector field 

in a zoomed view together with Γ2 criterion as it is defined by Graftieaux et al. [59], this figure shows 

how the vortical flow structures predominantly evolves when they are convected downstream of the 

step. A visual inspection of the vector fields shows that vortex pairing occurs at some instants of the 

flow sequence however the most recurrent scenario is a growing of the vortical flow structures by 

entrainment of the fluid when they are convected. As it is shown in Figure 14, the vortical flow 

structures are already formed at x/h=1. They are stretched during their convection but they remain 



25 

 

 

coherent all along the shear layer development. In its final stage, the flow structure has a size 

corresponding to the step height. Thus, the upper part of the vortical flow structure is in direct 

interaction with the main flow velocity (i.e., the flow in the upper part of the shear layer) that helps the 

flow structure to gain rotation speed and finally promotes a low resident time in the mean recirculating 

region. These flow structures are periodically shed in the wake of the BFS, this shedding being 

responsible for the strong frequency signature in the PSD of Figure 13.

is separated by 2.5 ms. 

 

For the actuation at the shear layer mode (Stθ=0.013), the organized development of the shear 

layer get new insight from the power density spectra analysis. In the earlier stage of the vortex 

formation (x/h=2), the influence of the actuator is clearly evidenced by the high amplitude peak 



27 

 

 

observed at the forcing frequency. The shear layer oscillations are fully periodic without a trace of 

high frequency content or low frequency vortex pairing. At x/h=4, the peak at the forcing frequency is 

largely damped. That suggests that the maximal amplification of the fundamental occurs upstream of 

x/h=4 (and upstream of the maximal amplification of the subharmonic, see the case of forcing at 

Stθ=0.006 introduced earlier in this paper) and that further downstream of this location the amplitude 

of the fundamental is decaying quickly. The PSDs also indicate that the vortex pairing process 

becomes significant from x/h=4 as demonstrated by the peaks at Stθ/2 and Stθ/4. The vortex pairing 

observed for shear layer mode forcing is illustrated in Figure 15. This sequence shows how two 

vortices (vortices A and B) can pair at location x/h~3.5. At the end of the amalgamation mechanism, 

the two structures have merged together to form a discrete coherent rotating region (vortex A+B). 

Finally, the pairing of vortices results in a single large-scale vortical flow structure that fills the space 

from the bottom wall up to the upper region of the separated shear layer. Due to the size of the flow 

structure and the entrainment of the convective flow, the residence time of large scale flow structures 

in the recirculating region is reduced. Both the reduced resident time and the promoted shedding 

process downstream of the mean reattachment point contribute to the periodic shrinkage of the 

recirculating region, this being partially responsible for the large reduction in the reattachment 

location. Furthermore, the amalgamation of adjacent vortices contributes to a larger spreading of the 

shear layer [47] as observed in Figure 11. The spreading mechanism, and the resulting reduced 

recirculation length, are also emphasized by the entrainment toward the recirculating region of non-

turbulent flow initially close to the upper part of the shear layer but transported toward the bottom wall 

by the coherent flow structures. Furthermore, as it is indicated in [60], the pairing process also 

enhances the regions of flow trapped between two successive vortical flow structures increasing 

further the transfer from the non-turbulent region to the recirculation zone. Here, the time-resolved 

PIV measurements confirm that the large reduction in reattachment position derives from the increase 

in vortex pairing caused by the local forcing at the shear layer mode.

IV Concluding remarks 
The present experimental study interests in optimizing by an autonomous approach the effects of a 

linear plasma actuator on the vortex development of a separated shear layer formed in the wake of a 



29 

 

 

backward-facing step. Here, the frequency, duty-cycle and amplitude of the imposed perturbations are 

simultaneously optimized regarding objective functions related to the mean flow reattachment location 

or to the level of the wall pressure fluctuations. The present study demonstrates that the reattachment 

length can be minimized or the wall fluctuating pressure maximized in only a few iterations, this with 

an electrical command autonomously optimized. However, the use of a GA code does not conduce to 

the definition of new control mechanisms as it can be expected by such an approach. Indeed, 

complimentary PIV measurements have shown that the two best forcing conditions identified by the 

GA approach correspond to the well-known excitations of the shear layer mode of instability of a 

turbulent shear layer (minimization of the reattachment) or to a periodic forcing at the first 

subharmonics of the most amplified mode (maximization of the wall fluctuating pressure coefficients). 

The time-resolved velocity fields indicate that periodic forcing by plasma discharge at the shear layer 

mode promotes a strong regularization of the vortex street. This forcing reduces largely the location of 

the mean reattachment point because of an enhanced vortex pairing mechanism. The present paper 

highlights the important role of the subharmonic instability for the development of the shear layer 

downstream of a BFS. Indeed, it was shown that large scale flow structures can be produced by 

forcing the flow at the first subharmonic of the shear layer mode. It has been shown that the 

amplification of the subharmonic continuously increases all along the shear layer development up to 

the reattachment point. This amplification corresponds to a vortex growing by both vortex pairing and 

fluid entrainment mechanisms as suggested by the time-resolved PIV measurements. These 

measurements have demonstrated that forcing by single-frequency at the subharmonic of the shear 

layer mode leads to the formation of flow structures with a vertical size corresponding to the height of 

the step mode; flow structures that are periodically shed in the wake of the BFS model and that persist 

beyond of the mean reattachment position. 

 Beyond simply using the robustness of an autonomous experimental optimization method, and its 

feasibility for wind tunnel experiments in context of flow control optimization, it is expected that 

autonomous seeking of optimal control conditions including multi-input and multi-objective 

capabilities would be of great interest for the flow control community. Indeed, in complex control 



30 

 

 

scenario, for instance when several actuators are considered individually, when multi-frequency 

forcing with phase shift [61] or when the second objective function concerns a minimization of the 

consumed power as in [20], such algorithms may highlight unseen influence of some design variable 

on the flow and reveal new control mechanisms.
