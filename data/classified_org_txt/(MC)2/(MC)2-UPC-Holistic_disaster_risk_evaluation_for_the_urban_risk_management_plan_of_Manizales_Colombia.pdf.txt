Abstract Disaster risk depends on both the physical vul-

nerability and a wide range of social, economic, and

environmental aspects of a society. For a better risk

understanding, a holistic or integrated perspective was

considered when risk was assessed for the city of

Manizales, Colombia. This assessment accounts not only

for the expected physical damage and loss, but also for the

socioeconomic vulnerability factors that favor second-

order effects in a disaster. This comprehensive approach

allows the identification of different aspects related to

physical vulnerability, social fragility, and lack of resi-

lience that can be improved, thus enhancing integrated

disaster risk management actions. The outcomes of this

comprehensive assessment are currently being used as

input to update the disaster risk management plan of

Manizales.

1 Introduction

Disaster risk is defined as the potential economic, social,

and environmental consequences of hazardous events that

may occur in a given period of time. In order to evaluate

risk according to this definition, the assessment should be

interdisciplinary and multisectoral and should take into

account not only the expected physical damage, the num-

ber and type of potential casualties or the economic losses,

but also the conditions related to social fragility and lack of

resilience that favor the second-order effects (indirect

effects) that amplify the impacts when a hazardous event

strikes an urban center.

A holistic risk assessment at the urban level needs to

account for the vulnerability in several of its dimensions

(social, economic, physical, cultural, environmental, and

institutional), and requires combining the physical risk

results with aspects that reflect the degree of social fragility

and lack of resilience (Carreño et al. 2007b; Birkman et al.

2013). Social fragility is measured by means of variables

that try to capture issues related to human welfare, such as

social integration, and mental and physical health, both at

the individual and the community level. Lack of resilience

is related to deficiencies in coping with disasters and

recovering from them. In this framework, resilience is

defined as the adaptive ability of a social-ecological system

to cope and absorb negative impacts as a result of the

capacity to anticipate, respond, and recover from damaging

events.

The level of a disaster depends not only on the intensity

of the natural event, but also on the vulnerability of the

exposed elements. In the case of small-scale disasters,

vulnerability is particularly important when the intensity of

the hazard events is moderate or even low. In contrast, in

the case of big disasters, vulnerability is quickly saturated

due to the intensity of the hazards, and therefore, its rela-

tive importance is smaller (Cardona 2004a; Marulanda

et al. 2010; Velásquez et al. 2014).

Disaster risk can be referred to as intensive risk when it

is associated with high-severity, mid- to low-frequency

hazardous events that involve large events—such as

earthquakes, tsunamis, large volcanic eruptions, flooding in

large river basins, or tropical cyclones—that are able to

affect a significant number of exposed elements simulta-

neously. Extensive risk is associated with low-severity,

high-frequency events, mainly but not exclusively related

to highly localized hazards that usually affect a few com-

munities at a time; in this case, the local and national

emergency response mechanisms are effective (UNISDR

2009, 2011, 2013; ERN-AL 2011). Small disasters (related

to extensive risk) are often the result of climate variability

and the increase in social, economic, and environmental

vulnerability. But they turn into a significant social prob-

lem because they destroy properties and livelihoods of the

weak sectors of society and deepen their incapability to

adapt, thereby perpetuating vulnerability and poverty

(Velásquez et al. 2014).

From a holistic and comprehensive perspective, risk

involves both the physical vulnerability and the social and

economic vulnerability factors that configure the suscepti-

bility conditions of urban areas. Physical vulnerability is

related to lack of structural strength of the assets exposed to

hazards, based on the potential intensities of the hazardous

events in a period of time. The susceptibility of the social

context depends on the socioeconomic fragilities and on

issues related to lack of resilience of the population in the

study area. Therefore, to reduce risk it is necessary to

implement corrective and prospective actions against both

hard and soft vulnerability factors. Consequently, disaster

risk management requires an interinstitutional and multi-

sectoral structure to implement, through public policies and

actions, the changes needed to reduce vulnerability and

disaster risk.

This article is focused on the holistic evaluation of the

seismic risk of the city of Manizales, Colombia, and how

the results of a comprehensive risk assessment are used for

updating the City Disaster Risk Management Plan.

2 Holistic Evaluation Methodology

Since 2001 the authors have been working on the holistic

approach for disaster risk assessment and have developed

and applied evaluation methodologies and metrics for this

objective (Cardona 2001, 2004a, b, 2011; Carreño 2006;

Carreño et al. 2007b). The evaluation methodology has

been improved and adapted according to the case studies

and the availability of information related to hard (physical

risk) and soft vulnerability factors (Barbat et al.

2010, 2011; Carreño et al. 2012, 2014a, b; Birkman et al.

2013; Cárdenas et al. 2015; Jaramillo et al. 2016).

Carreño et al. (2007a, 2012) developed two alternative

versions of the evaluation model—one based on indicators

and the other based on expert opinions—in which risk

assessment is performed by affecting the physical risk with

socioeconomic factors or risk drivers, in order to reflect

how socioeconomic fragilities and lack of resilience

aggravate or amplify the direct effects of disasters. This

holistic evaluation method has been implemented as a post-

processing tool of the Comprehensive Approach to Prob-

abilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) platform (Cardona

et al. 2012; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2016). This approach

contributes to the effectiveness of risk management,

inviting to action through the identification of development

weaknesses and shortcomings at the urban center (Carreño

et al. 2007a).

Socioeconomic fragility and lack of resilience are

described by a set of indicators that aggravate the physical

risk. Thus, the total risk depends on the direct effects or

physical risk, and the indirect effects expressed as a factor

of the direct effects. Therefore, the total risk is expressed as

follows:

RT ¼ RF 1þ Fð Þ ð1Þ

where RT is the total risk index, RF is the physical risk

index, (1 ? F) is an impact factor, and F is the aggravating

coefficient. This coefficient depends on the socioeconomic

fragility, SF, and on the lack of resilience of the exposed

context, LR.

The physical risk, RF, is evaluated using the following

equation:

RF ¼
Xp

i¼1
FRFi:wRFi ð2Þ

where p is the total number of indicators related to the

physical risk, FRFi are the component factors and wRFi are

their weights. The physical risk factors, FRFi, are calculated

using the net values of physical risk indicators; they can be

the result of a deterministic or a probabilistic risk assess-

ment, such as the number of casualties, the value of

destroyed area, the pure risk premium (that is, the relative

average annual loss), and so on (Lantada et al. 2010). The

weights are defined on the basis of local expert opinions

processed by means of the analytic hierarchy process

(AHP) that is used to derive ratio scales from both discrete

and continuous paired comparisons (Saaty 1980; Carreño

et al. 2007a).

The indicators used in this evaluation have different

characteristics and units, and transformation functions

should be used to standardize the gross values of each

Int J Disaster Risk Sci 259

123



indicator, transforming them into commensurable risk

factors, taking a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

The transformation functions used in the methodology

in order to calculate the hard and soft risk factors are

membership functions for high levels of risk defined for

each indicator in the terminology of fuzzy sets and logic

(Carreño et al. 2007a). The value 0.0 represents the non-

membership and 1.0 corresponds to total membership. The

limit values, Xmin and Xmax, are defined taking into account

expert opinions and information about previous disasters.

Figure 1 gives a model for these functions.

Similar functions are used in the case of the indicators

for social fragility and lack of resilience to develop the

transformation functions. Sigmoid functions are used in

most cases, and the type S or Z is used depending on the

type of indicator. In the case of the indicators of lack of

resilience, the function has an inverse (Z) shape, that is,

higher values of the indicator result in lower values of

aggravation. The aggravating coefficient is calculated in a

way that is similar to computing the weighted sum of the

aggravating factors.

F ¼
Xm

i¼1
FSFi � wSFi þ

Xn

j¼1
FLRj � wLRj ð3Þ

where FSFi are factors related to the socioeconomic fragi-

lity, and FLRj are factors related to the lack of resilience of

the exposed context. The weights wSFi and wLRj represent

the relative importance of each factor and are calculated by

means of the AHP based on local expert opinions.

The indicators are selected, depending on the case study,

as the most significant for each category. For example, in

the case of social fragility, we can use the slum-squatter

neighborhoods area, the mortality rate, the delinquency

rate, and the population density. In the case of lack of

resilience, the number of hospital beds, the health human

resources, the public space area, the rescue and firemen

manpower, the development level, and the emergency

planning can be used. These indicators can be replaced by

others according to the information available for each case

study. There is not a minimum indicators number estab-

lished to apply the methodology; instead, it is expected that

the indicators involve information related to the social

fragility and lack of resilience of the community. Jaramillo

et al. (2016) provide an idea about indicators that can be

used following the indicators applied by urban observato-

ries of the United Nations and other social researchers.

The robustness of this methodology has been studied by

assessing the uncertainty of values and the sensitivity to

change of values, weights, and transformation functions.

The methodology is not excessively sensitive to slight

variations of the input data and to small changes in the

modeling parameters, such as weights and transformation

functions. If the range of variation of data and parameters

is reasonable, the results of the numerical simulations will

be stable and reliable. More details about the robustness

analysis are given by Marulanda et al. (2009).

Detailed information about this evaluation method can

be found in Carreño (2006), Carreño et al. (2007b), and

Barbat et al. (2011). For management purposes, the risk

assessment should improve the decision-making process in

order to contribute to the effectiveness of risk management,

calling for action and for identifying the weaknesses of the

exposed elements and their evolution over time (Carreño

et al. 2007a). In the case that the basic information required

by this methodology does not exist or is not available, the

holistic evaluation of the disaster risk can be performed by

using expert opinions and applying an alternative

methodology based on the fuzzy sets theory (Carreño et al.

2012, 2014a).

3 Holistic Evaluation of the Disaster Risk
for Manizales

Manizales, with a population of 400,000 inhabitants, is

located on the Colombian Central Mountain Range (part of

the Andean Mountains, Cordillera de Los Andes) in the

northern part of the Coffee-Growers Axis (Eje Cafetero).

Due to this location, the city has an abrupt topography with

steep slopes that has required public infrastructure for land

stabilization in several areas of the city.

Manizales has been affected by various hazards in the

past: landslides induced by rain, generated in most cases by

the formation of settlements in areas with very steep

slopes, as a product of the dispersed and uncontrolled

growth of the city; floods, mainly on the banks of the

Chinchiná River and Manizales, Olivares, and El Guamo

creeks; ash fall events due to volcanic threat; and earth-

quakes. During the twentieth century the city was affected

by six major earthquakes. This experience allows a better

understanding of disaster risks for the decision makers and

citizens in general. The city has been developing and

consolidating its practices and public policies on integrated

risk management for several years, especially since the

1970s.

This article is focused on the holistic evaluation of the

disaster risk of the city of Manizales, Colombia, and how

the results of the risk assessment have been used to update

the City Disaster Risk Management Plan. The city of

Manizales is subdivided into 11 districts (comunas in

Spanish), which are the study areas for this evaluation:

Atardeceres, San José, Cumanday, Estación, Ciudadela del

Norte, Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro, Tesorito, Palogrande,

Universitaria, La Fuente, and La Macarena. These districts

do not have independent decision makers on disaster risk

management, and they have strong differences among them

that can be captured by this evaluation in order to focus

efforts on different aspects that contribute to disaster risk.

This evaluation was requested and funded by the local

government. The results obtained by district are useful for

the city administration in order to prioritize specific mea-

sures for each area in the city. It is expected that the local

government will update this evaluation every 4 years to

review the progress and effects of the different policies and

measures in the city.

3.1 Physical Risk Index

A probabilistic approach was used for the analysis of

seismic and landslide hazards (triggered by earthquakes or

heavy rainfall) to obtain stochastic event sets suitable for

the probabilistic loss estimation and risk results in terms of

different metrics after aggregating in a rigorous way the

losses associated to the different hazards. Detailed and

high-resolution exposure databases were used for the

building stock and infrastructure of Manizales, together

with a set of vulnerability functions for each of the con-

sidered perils. The physical risk index, RF in Eq. 1, is based

on the results of this fully probabilistic multihazard risk

assessment made for the city using the CAPRA platform

(Bernal 2014; Bernal et al. 2017). Risk was assessed on a

building-by-building basis, and by aggregating the metrics

for the whole districts. Further details on the physical risk

assessment can be found, as part of this special issue, in

Bernal et al. (2017). For this evaluation, the selected

indicators correspond to the pure risk premium (average

annual loss / exposed reposition value) for six sectors:

residential (RF1), commercial (RF2), industrial (RF3),

health (RF4), institutional (RF5), and education (RF6).

These values were standardized by using a transformation

function that defines a value of 10% as the maximum pure
risk premium for a risk factor of 1.0. Table 1 shows the

obtained factors, the calculated weights for each factor, and

the physical risk index for each district and for the city as a

whole. The weights assigned to the risk factors are the

same for all districts in the city.

High physical risk occurs mainly in the residential and

commercial sectors of the city. In order to make this

evaluation useful for decision making, it is necessary to

focus the attention on the obtained results for each district.

In the case of the residential sector, the risk factor FRF1
takes values greater than or equal to 0.8 in most of the

districts of the city (8 of 11) because the vulnerability of

informal buildings. The districts San José, Cumanday,

Estación, Ciudadela del Norte, and Ecoturı́stico Cerro de

Oro reach the maximum value, or a value very close to it,

due to the concentration of buildings built before the first

national seismic code (1984). Atardeceres has a low value

of 0.30 for the risk factor in the residential sector. The risk

factor for the commercial sector (FRF2) shows greater dif-

ferences between the districts of the city. Cumanday,

Ciudadela del Norte, La Fuente, and La Macarena districts

have values greater than 0.8. The districts of Tesorito and

Universitaria have low values; these districts were built

more recently applying seismic design codes. The risk

factor for the industrial sector (FRF3) also shows marked

differences among the districts of the city. Only Cumanday

has the maximum value because the buildings are older.

San José, Palogrande, and La Fuente have values greater

than 0.8 due to the lack of construction quality. Tesorito

has a very low value (0.06), because this is a new area of

the city.

In the case of the health sector (FRF4), there are also

large differences among the risk factors of the districts of

the city. Two districts, Cumanday and La Fuente, reach the

maximum value, while Universitaria has a value of 0.03

because most buildings in this area are earthquake resistant

constructions. The physical risk factor for the institutional

sector (FRF5) takes the maximum value for the Ciudadela

del Norte district. Four districts—Atardeceres, Tesorito,

Universitaria, and La Fuente—have values below 0.2. In

the case of the education sector (FRF6), La Macarena is the

only district that reaches the maximum value (1.0) because

most buildings in that district are among the oldest, and

Estación and Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro have values higher

than 0.8. Atardeceres, Ciudadela del Norte, and Tesorito

have the lowest values.

3.2 Aggravating Coefficient

Indicators related to social fragility and lack of resilience

were identified to define the aggravating coefficient

(F) and, therefore, the impact factor (1 ? F) of the

potential physical damage and loss. They reflect the social

absences, weaknesses, and susceptibilities from a devel-

opment point of view that should be addressed by the

processes of economic and social development planning to

reduce vulnerability and risk from a comprehensive per-

spective. Table 2 shows the indicators related to social

fragility (SF) and lack of resilience (LR) selected for the

holistic evaluation, in accordance with the available

information and the Xmin and Xmax parameters used in the

transformation functions for each case. The indicators used

to calculate the aggravating coefficient correspond to the

official information provided by different agencies at the

local and national levels such as: the Secretariat of Plan-

ning (Secretarı́a de Planeación), the Secretariat of Public

Health and Legal Medicine (Secretarı́a de Salud Pública y

Medicina Legal), the Risk Management Unit (Unidad de

Gestión del Riesgo), the National Administrative Depart-

ment of Statistics (Departamento Administrativo Nacional

de Estadı́stica—DANE), the System of Identification of

Potential Beneficiaries for Social Programs (Sistema de

Identificación de Potenciales Beneficiarios de Programas

Sociales—SISBEN), and the National Planning Department

(Departamento Nacional de Planeación) (Suárez 2015).

The indicators included in Table 2 were selected with

the objective of involving the most representative infor-

mation on the risk drivers of social fragility and lack of

resilience, with complete coverage of the city areas, and

the most updated information evaluated in a participatory

way in the framework of the city program ‘‘Manizales

>cómo vamos?’’ (Manizales, how are we doing?).
Table 3 shows the results for the aggravating factors for

each district of Manizales, taking into consideration the 11

indicators listed in Table 2. They have been obtained by

using transformation functions type S (for social fragility)

and Z (for lack of resilience) to standardize each indicator.

The total aggravating coefficient (F) is obtained after

scaling all the factors in commensurable units by using

Eq. 3. Table 3 also shows the average values of the factors

for the city, normalized with the density of population. The

average values for the city recognize the murder rate, the

lack of hospital beds, the lack of health human resources,

and the lack of public space as the main aggravating con-

ditions. But to guide decision making it is necessary to

review the situation for each district.

The districts of San José and La Macarena show serious

problems related to the social fragility and lack of resi-

lience of the community, with the maximum contribution

from the aggravating factors of murder rate, hospital beds,

public space, medium to high socioeconomic stratum,

population density, and health human resources.

The aggravating factor related to the slum area (FSF1) is

particularly relevant in La Macarena (0.76) and La Fuente

(0.45), while in the other districts of the city it has values

lower than 0.15. The aggravation due to the rate of murders

(FSF2) in the districts of the city is very close to the max-

imum value for most of the districts (9 of 11); this reflects

social deterioration and breakdown in most parts of the

city. The aggravation related to the lack of education of the

population (FSF3) for San José is the worst value in the city

(0.69). Atardeceres, Ciudadela del Norte, Universitaria, La

Fuente, and La Macarena, present values greater or equal to

0.40.

The values for the aggravating factor due to over-

crowding of the population (FSF4) show higher values in

the districts of San José (1.00) and La Macarena (0.80).

The lower values of this factor correspond to the districts

Cumanday, Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro, Tesorito, and

Palogrande. The aggravation related to the population

density (FSF5) shows values equal to or very close to the

maximum value (1.0) for the districts San José, Cumanday,

and La Fuente.

The aggravating factor related to the lack of hospital

beds (FLR1) has the worst values, very close to the maxi-

mum value for most of the districts (9 of 11). Atardeceres

and Estación have lower values, although they are not

negligible. The lack of hospital beds is an aspect that

should be improved for the whole city. The lack of health

human resources (FLR2) is similar to the lack of hospital

beds. Most of the districts have the maximum value or very

close to it, except Atardeceres (0.9). The contribution of

the lack of public space (FLR3) has values greater than 0.8

for 6 of the 11 districts (San José, Cumanday, Estación,

Ciudadela del Norte, Palogrande, and La Macarena). The

lack of public space does not represent a problem for

Atardeceres and Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro. The aggrava-

tion due to the lack of rescue human resources (FLR4) has

very low values. Only Estación and Ciudadela del Norte

have high values that indicate a significant lack of

resilience.

The districts San José, Ciudadela del Norte, Universi-

taria, and Macarena show the highest level of aggravation

with respect to level of development (FLR5). Atardeceres,

Estación, and Palogrande show no problem in this area. In

contrast, Palogrande is the only district that presents the

maximum value of aggravation in the area of community

participation (FLR6); Cumanday and Ecoturı́stico Cerro de

Oro also have high values of aggravation. The other dis-

tricts of the city have values lower than 0.35. Estación and

La Fuente show no aggravation due to lack of community

participation.

It is also possible to compare the different factors within

each district. This is useful for identifying the contribution

of each factor to the total risk of each district and for

prioritizing the alternative risk reduction actions.

3.3 Evaluation of the Total Risk

The composite total risk index (RT) is calculated based on

the component indicators. It has been used as the Urban

Disaster Risk Index (UDRi) for each district of the city,

like it has been evaluated for other cities worldwide

(Suarez 2007; Marulanda et al. 2009, 2013; Khazai et al.

2015). Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the results for the eleven

districts, taking into consideration the physical risk, the

aggravating coefficient, and the total risk, respectively. The

figures show how the physical risk map values (Fig. 2) are

amplified by the aggravating coefficient (Fig. 3), and result

in the total risk or the UDRi (Fig. 4). All ranges of physical

risk, the aggravating factor, and total risk were defined with

officers and advisors of the Secretariat of Planning, taking

into account the disparity and social characteristics used in

the city to rank and compare the districts.

The aggravating coefficient (Fig. 3) shows medium–

high values for the districts of San José, La Macarena,

Ciudadela del Norte, and La Fuente; medium values for the

districts of Universitaria, Cumanday, and Estación; med-

ium–low values for Tesorito, Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro,

and Palogrande; and a low value for Atardeceres.

The total risk (Fig. 4) shows high value for the district

of Cumanday; medium–high values for La Macarena, San

José, and La Fuente; medium values for Estación, Ciu-

dadela del Norte, and Palogrande; medium–low values for

Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro and Universitaria; and low val-

ues for Atardeceres and Tesorito.

Once the results and the ranking of risk in Manizales

have been obtained by district, it is possible to review each

case and disaggregate it into its components, identify which

factors and indicators are more relevant, and define the

possible actions to reduce the underlying causes of risk.

The UDRi results for Manizales were analyzed for each

district. Carreño (2015) provides detailed information

related to the evaluation process and to the obtained results

for the holistic evaluation of disaster risk, including the

analysis for each district in the city.

Cumanday (C3) showshigh total riskandhighphysical risk,

illustrated by the levels of probable losses for the industrial,

health, institutional, and educational sectors. It is the oldest

area of the city. In the case of the aggravation, the most

problematic factors are the murder rate, population density,

lack of hospital beds, lack of human resources in health, lack of

public space, and lack of community participation.

La Macarena (C11) presents high total risk and a high

physical risk in the education, commercial, residential, and

health sectors. The aggravation is mainly associated with

the murder rate, the lack of hospital beds, the lack of

human resources in health, the lack of public space, and the

low level of development.

San José (C2) shows high to a medium–high level of

total risk, the same level for physical risk and aggravation.

Physical risk is high in the residential, industrial, and

institutional sectors. The factors that amplify risk are the

murder rate, population density, lack of hospital beds, lack

of human resources in health, lack of public space, low

level of development, and overcrowded tenant houses.

La Fuente (C10) shows a medium–high level of total

risk due to medium–high values of physical risk and the

impact factor as a result of the level of aggravation.

Specifically, the district presents a high physical risk for

the health, residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.

The aggravation is mostly related to the murder rate,

population density, lack of hospital beds, lack of human

resource in health, and the level of development.

Estación (C4) presents amedium level of total risk obtained

from a medium–high level of physical risk and a medium

aggravation level. The physical risk is high for the residential,

education, and health sectors. Aggravation has the greater

contributions from the lack of human resources in health, the

lack of public space, and the lack of rescue human resources.

Ciudadela del Norte (C5) shows a medium level of total

risk resulting from a medium level of physical risk and a

medium–high aggravation. Specifically, the physical risk is

high in the residential, commercial, and institutional sec-

tors. The conditions related to the greatest aggravation are

the murder rate, lack of hospital beds, lack of human

resources in health, level of development, lack of rescue

human resources, and public space.

Palogrande (C8) presents a medium level of total risk

resulting from a medium level of physical risk and a

medium–low aggravation. Specifically, it presented a high

physical risk for the residential and industrial sectors. The

aggravation is mostly related to the lack of hospital beds,

lack of community participation, lack of human resources

in health and public space.

Ecoturı́stico Cerro de Oro (C6) shows a medium–low

total risk level, resulting from a medium physical risk level

and a medium–low aggravation. The physical risk is mostly

due to the residential and education sectors. The

aggravation is mainly related to the lack of hospital beds,

lack of human resources in health, the homicide rate, and

the lack of community participation.

Universitaria (C9) presents a medium–low total risk

level, as the result of a medium–low physical risk and a

medium–high aggravation. Specifically, the physical risk is

identified for the residential sector. The aggravation is

related to the homicide rate, the lack of hospital beds, lack

of human resources in health, and the level of development.

Atardeceres (C1) shows a low level of total risk resulting

from a medium–low physical risk and a low aggravation. A

medium–low physical risk is identified in the health and com-

mercial sectors. The aggravation shows a high level in relation

to the murder rate and the lack of human resources in health.

Tesorito (C7) presents a low total risk, resulting from a

low physical risk and a medium–low aggravation. Specifi-

cally, a medium–high physical risk is identified in the resi-

dential sector. The aggravation is related to the murder rate,

lack of human resources in health and lack of hospital beds.

4 The Urban Disaster Risk Management Plan
of Manizales

The Urban Disaster Risk Management Plan is the legal

instrument, according to Law 1523 of 2012, through which

the objectives, goals, strategies, actions, and actors are

defined to implement the national policy of risk manage-

ment of Colombia, during a period of 12 years

(2016–2028, three administrations). Figure 5 presents the

main programs and subprograms for the city of Manizales,

within the framework of the risk knowledge, risk reduction,

and disaster management processes.

This municipal plan was adopted by decree (Alcaldı́a de

Manizales 2016a) to define the medium- and long-term

actions, derived from the general diagnosis of the city

through the physical and holistic assessment of the disaster

risk, and the evaluation of the disaster risk management

performance in the city by using the Risk Management

Index (RMI) (Carreño et al. 2004, 2007a), both in retro-

spective and prospective ways. It also defines the goals, the

general procedures, and mechanisms for achieving the

goals, the budget, and the schedule of all activities. The

strategic and programmatic components of the plan have

been the result of a participatory process, in which it was

possible to systematize contributions from the different

public and private stakeholders and actors, who attended

different workshops and interagency meetings. Both gen-

eral objectives for the whole city and specific objectives by

districts of the city have been defined, using the results of

the holistic disaster risk assessment described above. In

addition, the holistic risk assessment has been included in

the plan as a recursive process and continuous risk

266 Carreño et al. Holistic Disaster Risk Evaluation of Manizales

123



research, facilitating the dynamic and adaptive manage-

ment by risk problem framing and reframing.

This plan was incorporated into the socioeconomic

Development Plan of the current administration (2016–2019)

as a component of environment, climate change, and disaster

risk management and will guide the action to reach the

development objectives and goals and the instruments of

linkage and harmonization with other plans at the city level,

such as the territorial or land-use planning (POT, Plan de

Ordenamiento Territorial, in Spanish) and the emergency

response plan of the city (Alcaldı́a de Manizales 2016b).

5 Conclusion

Risk understanding is an unavoidable process and early step

for risk management. The formulation of a policy and pro-

cess for risk reduction and of adaptation should be based on

knowledge of the components and the disaggregation of the

underlying causes of vulnerability and risk, taking into

account both their harder and softer characteristics. Holistic

risk assessment has been developed to deal with these

characteristics, considering the physical risk, or potential

direct effects, and its amplification, or potential indirect

effects. This type of integrated and scientific approach

facilitates decision-making and the flexible adjustment in

practice of actions to be implemented by different actors as a

disaster risk management plan.

The Disaster Risk Management Plan of Manizales,

Colombia, has been formulated based on the participation

of the different private and public actors and with the input

from the holistic disaster risk assessment of the city.

Strategic and programmatic components have been

defined, framing and reframing the risk problem, and

identifying the main actions to be implemented in each

district of the city and making the follow-up of risk

reduction in a dynamic way, using the holistic risk

assessment approach to give account of the improvements

and achievements on vulnerability and risk reduction.

The results for the city of Manizales can be compared

with those obtained for other cities following the same

methodology. But, for such a comparison, it is necessary to

take into account that the indicators involved in the eval-

uation can change according to the existent and available

information in each case. The objective of this holistic

approach is to support the decision-making process on

disaster risk reduction by improving the risk understanding

of the stakeholders; the comparison with other cities can

provide a general idea of the situation, but the real value of

this evaluation is in the identification of differences at local

level.
