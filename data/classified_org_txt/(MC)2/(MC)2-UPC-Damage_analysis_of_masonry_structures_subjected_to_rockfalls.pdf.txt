Abstract  
Masonry structures present substantial vulnerability to rockfalls.  The methodologies for the 
damage quantification of masonry structures subjected to rockfalls are scarce. An analytical 
procedure for the damage assessment of masonry structures is presented. The procedure 
comprises three stages: (1) Determination of the rockfall impact actions which are applied to a 
masonry structure, in terms of external forces, using the Particle Finite Element method PFEM; 
(2) Evaluation of the mechanical properties, modelling of the masonry structure, and calculation 
of the internal stresses, using the finite element method FEM; (3) Assessment of the damage due 
to the rockfall actions, applying a failure criterion adapted to masonries, and  calculation of the 
damage in terms of the percentage of the damaged wall surface. Three real rockfall events and 
their impact on buildings are analysed. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed procedure is then 
used to identify the variables that mostly affect the extent of the wall damage, which are the 
masonry width, the tensile strength, the block diameter and lastly, velocity.   

1. Introduction  
Rock falls are very frequent soil instabilities occurring in cut and natural slopes and coasts. During 
a rockfall, the high velocity of the fall reduces critically the reaction time of individuals and 
communities. Protection measures, as nets and barriers, are common ways of prevention. 
However, if they do not exist or they are ineffective, significant structural and non-structural 
damage maybe caused to buildings and their occupants.  

Although sophisticated methods for the analysis of the stability of rocky slopes exist (Corominas 
et al. 2014), the rockfall vulnerability assessment of structures is poor and mainly empirical, 
resulting in uncertain loss predictions (Papathoma-Kohle et al. 2007). For big rockfall events, the 
loss due to the impact of rock boulders on buildings is expected to be very high. Nevertheless for 
small and medium-sized events, this loss varies. The vulnerability of buildings in rockfall prone 
areas, when expressed in quantitative terms, can provide an objective parameter for the cost-
benefit analysis for the protection interventions. To this aim the objective here has been the 
assessment and quantification of the rockfall vulnerability of buildings.  

To assess the vulnerability level of a structure, four main groups of methods exist 
(UNDP/UNESCO, 1982): (i) Categorization methods, based on the typological classification of 
structures into typological classes; (ii) Inspection and rating (empirical) methods, with an 
attribution of numerical value to each structure; (iii) Analytical methods, based on the analysis of 
a structure for the estimation of its expected resistance at an accidental event; (iv) Experimental 
methods, including tests for the determination of the structural properties of the whole structure 
and its components. Several researchers have proposed analytical methods for the evaluation of 
the vulnerability of buildings impacted by rapidly moving landslides such as debris flows (Fuchs 



2 
 

et al. 2007; Totching and Fuchs  2013; Quan Luna et al. 2011) and snow avalanches (Bertrand 
et al. 2010).  

The rockfall vulnerability has been in generally quantified to a lesser extent, mostly by means of 
empirical evaluations (Agliardi et al. 2009; Glade and Crozier 2005) without differentiating 
between typological classes. The response of structural elements to boulder impacts has been 
further investigated for embankments and protection structures (Volkwein et al. 2011), using 
empirical, analytical and experimental methods, as far as it concerns the impact loads, the energy 
transfer from the boulder to the structural elements and the response of the latter. Mavrouli and 
Corominas (2010a, 2010b) and Mavrouli et al. (2014) presented a method for the vulnerability 
assessment of reinforced concrete buildings. However, these results cannot be generalised to 
different structural typologies from the studied ones, as the structural performance of a building 
is strongly influenced by its geometry, load-bearing system and materials. Although masonries 
are common typologies in mountainous rockfall prone areas worldwide, the rockfall vulnerability 
of masonry buildings has received little attention so far. 

As real events indicate, certain masonry structures retain substantial vulnerability to the dynamic 
impact of rockfalls. This is due to the brittle nature of the unreinforced masonry elements and their 
general design without considering loads with direction out of their plane (Schmidt and Cheng 
2009). Masonry is an assemblage of units (stone blocks, bricks etc.) and mortar joints. Lourenço 
(2008) presents the most common masonry types, depending on the materials and their 
configurations. The response of the masonries to external actions presents many sources of 
uncertainties (Mojsilovic and Faber 2008), therefore in order to describe it, a probabilistic 
approach is preferred instead of a deterministic one. The probabilistic approaches, exactly as the 
deterministic ones, require the application of models and methodologies for the assessment of 
the structural response of buildings subjected to rockfalls.  

The numerical analysis of masonry buildings can indicate their expected performance to given 
rockfall impacts, independently of the existence of empirical data. It can provide a tool for 
assessment of the damage, which takes into consideration specific typological classes and 
characteristics, and provides distinct damage degrees for given rockfall magnitudes and 
intensities.  The masonry analysis requires methodologies that can incorporate its peculiarities 
with respect to the heterogeneity and variability of the composite materials, the orthotropy along 
its two directions with reference to the horizontal and vertical joints planes, its low tensile strength, 
and the statically indeterminate load-bearing system.  

The use of the Finite Element Method for the analysis of masonry structures subjected to out-of-
plane loading has been proposed by many researchers (Martini 1997), for static and dynamic 
problems. Different alternatives exist for the constitutive modelling and the homogenisation of the 
materials (Lourenço 1996), the consideration of non-linearities (Burnett et al. 2007; Wu and Hao 
2006) and two or three dimensional configurations (Syrmakezis et al. 2005c).  Syrmakezis et al. 
(2005a, 2005b, 2006) proposed a complete stress and failure analysis of masonry structures 
subjected to out-of-plane earthquake loading using the finite-element method to calculate model 
stresses, displacements and dynamic structural properties (i.e. eigen-period). In that methodology 
the first stage finite element analysis information is completed by a failure analysis, applying a 
failure criterion especially adapted to masonry structures (Syrmakezis and Asteris 2001). In this 
way, problematic areas on the structure can be located, possible causes of failure can be 
quantified, and the expected damage can be specified on a qualitative and quantitative basis. The 
failure analysis was performed using the software FAILURE. Using the results of this analysis 
Marinelli et al. (2004) have provided a procedure for incorporating the uncertainties which are 
involved in the seismic response of masonry structures, using fragility curves.  

The works on the behaviour of masonries subjected to impacts by drop-weights are scarce, while 
most of them focus on the seismic (DeJong 2009) or blast (Milani and Lourenço 2009; Mayrhofer 
2002) actions. Lourenço et al. (2010) studied the impact behaviour of masonry arches using the 
finite element method for high strain-rate loads (impulses). Schmidt and Cheng (2009) developed 
a finite element model for the analysis of the out-of-plane impact response of unreinforced 
masonry walls proposing a constitutive model for the simulation of contact forces between a 
moving mass and a wall. Burnett et al. (2007) used linear elastic solid elements for masonry units 
in conjunction with a specially formulated contact interface model for masonry joints; they 
developed a simplified discrete-crack finite element approach to model unreinforced brickwork 
and blockwork masonry walls subjected to out-of-plane impacts. These models work for low-
velocity impacts. There is a lack of studies on the performance of masonries subjected to high-



3 
 

velocity rockfall impacts. Hence, there is a need to provide methodologies that take into 
consideration the impact forces that are developed on a masonry wall due to the wall-boulder 
interaction and that can provide a measure for its damage. It is the aim of this work to bridge this 
gap. 

We focus on a methodology that analyses masonry structures and assesses their damage, 
according to Syrmakezis et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2006) including calculations for both stresses and 
failure. The degree of damage is, then, provided as the percentage of the area that failed (its 
resistance was exceeded by the rockfall actions). Using this process, we analytically examined 
three different rockfalls in the Pyrenees, leading to the impact of rock boulders on buildings. Given 
the size of the rock boulders, we calculated the damage, its pattern and extent, and we compared 
it with the observed damage.   

To adapt this methodology to rockfall impacts a further step is proposed. This step aims at 
calculating the impact force that is applied to a masonry wall by a rock boulder, considering the 
wall characteristics and the boulder kinematic properties (size and velocity). Due to the high 
stress-rate of the rockfall impact, it is important to incorporate the effect of the impact velocity and 
the wall/boulder interaction. 

The proposed procedure is applied to identify the variables that mostly affect the wall vulnerability, 
performing a sensitivity analysis. These variables refer to the characteristics of the masonry and 
of the rock boulder at the moment of the impact. These factors should be taken into consideration 
when assessing the vulnerability and the risk. 

This work forms part of an ongoing work on the vulnerability of masonry buildings subjected to 
rockfall impacts. It is intended to use it for the assessment of the response of a variety of structural 
typologies to a series of rockfall impacts, and the development of fragility curves for a wide range 
of applications.  

2. Analytical methodology 
The proposed methodology implicates three stages for the evaluation of the structural response 
of masonry walls subjected to rockfall impacts.  

(1) Determination of the rockfall impact actions that are applied to a masonry structure, in terms 
of external forces, using the Particle Finite Element method PFEM.  

(2) Evaluation of the mechanical properties and modelling of the masonry structure, using the 
finite element method FEM and calculation of the internal stresses.  

(3) Assessment of the damage of the masonry structure, applying a failure criterion on the 
results of step (2) and using the software FAILURE (Syrmakezis and Asteris 2001); 
quantification of the damage in terms of percentage of the damaged wall surface.  

These steps are explained in the following sections.  

2.1 Rockfall actions on masonry walls  
The simulation of the interaction between an impacting boulder and a masonry wall, including the 
transmission of the impact energy between them, is a complex issue due to the large number of 
involved factors: the relative masses, stiffnesses and velocities of the rock block and the wall, the 
contact zone, the loading time-history, the impact precision, and the area of the absorbed local 
energy. 

In order to quantify the impact forces and the energy absorbed by the wall, the masonry walls 
should be modelled. Due to the in-homogeneities characterizing such structures, both modelling 
and numerical simulations are hard to be treated in a standard way.  Although masonry is not an 
homogeneous material, a simplified option to evaluate its response is to model it as a continuum 
body incorporating given isotropic average properties. When specific details on the possible 
cracking are required, the use of accurate and more sophisticated models is necessary instead, 
either for stone masonry walls (Ramakrishnan and Lourenço 2009) or for clay brick masonry walls 
(Bakhteri and Sambasivam 2003; Brasile et al. 2010; Bakhteri et al. 2004). In all cases, the Finite 
Element Method (FEM) is commonly used for this. The FEM formulates a solution on the 



4 
 

mechanics of the continuum to represent the internal stress evolution of a medium under certain 
loading conditions. 
To evaluate the impact forces, the contact zone and the resultant energy, the mechanical stresses 
that are developed during the contact should be also taken into account. The contact mechanics 
are characterized by complexity when it comes to their modelling and numerical simulation. In the 
case of an impact of a rock boulder with a masonry wall, both parts can be considered deformable. 
The results vary depending on the stiffness of each part, and this makes the analysis of the 
interaction of the two bodies more complex. A considerable deformation of the softer media 
affects the contact area.  Hence if there is an impact, the impact-induced acceleration and the 
dynamics of the interaction must be taken into account. All these aspects introduce a large set of 
new non-linearities to the model.  

In this work, one of the objectives was to use a method suitable to capture the impact 
characteristics of a rock boulder on a masonry wall and able to surpass all modelling complexities. 
For this reason the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) joined with the Contact Domain 
Method (CDM) is proposed.  

The PFEM is founded on the Lagrangian description of particles and motion and it combines a 
meshless definition of the continuum containing a cloud of particles with standard mesh-based 
finite element techniques. The initial developments of the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) 
took place in the field of fluid mechanics (Idelsohn et al. 2004; Oñate et al. 2004), because of the 
PFEM feasible features of tracking and modelling of free surfaces. Later on, the Particle Finite 
Element (PFEM) was applied in a variety of simulation problems and to solid mechanics. The first 
applications of PFEM to solid mechanics took place for problems involving large strains and 
rotations, multiple body contacts and creation of new surfaces (riveting, powder filling, ground 
excavation and machining) (Carbonell et al. 2013; Oliver et al. 2007). 
 
In the PFEM, the continuum, representing a solid, is described by a collection of particles in space. 
The particles contain enough information to generate the actual boundaries of the analysis 
domain. Meshing techniques like the Delaunay tessellation and the alpha-shape concept 
(Edelsbrunner and Mucke 1994) are used to discretize the continuum with finite elements starting 
from the particle distribution. The meshing process creates continuum subdomains and identifies 
the geometrical contacts geometry between different sub-domains (Fig. 1). 
 
 

 
Fig.1 Using the alpha-shapes the detection of contact between sub-domains is automatically 
generated. Contact Domain elements are formed when the sub-domains are close enough. The 
identification of the continuum between subdomains is used for the definition of the contact 
set, which provides the active area of contact where the contact constraint is applied. The 
Contact Domain Method (CDM) is specially formulated to take into account the contact 
constraint defined by an interface finite element mesh (Oliver et al. 2009; Hartmann et al. 2009)

Using the PFEM and the CDM the impact of the boulder against the wall can be simulated 
properly. For simplicity, and in order to define a useful representative model, we started with a 
definition of a two dimensional model consisting of: 

(1) A wall defined by its height and thickness, fixed at the base and supported at the top. The 
masonry material characterized as an elastic material by the Young Modulus, the Poison Ratio 
and the Density. 

(2) A rock boulder that can have different shapes. The first approach is a regular quadrilateral 
shape. The material is also considered elastic with a Young Modulus, Poison Ratio, and a Density. 
The boulder is considered stiffer than the wall and the material parameters are defined 
accordingly. 

The self-weight is considered for both bodies, and the boulder is located next to the wall with an 
initial imposed velocity to set the movement against the wall.  

To give a representative view of the analysis, some results are presented in Fig. 2. In this example 
the wall has a height of 3 meters and a thickness of 0.6 meters. The rock boulder is a quadrilateral 
of 1x1 meters with an initial velocity of 5 m/s. Fig. 2 shows how the boulder-wall interaction is 
captured and the dynamic impact forces calculated at every time step of the analysis. The 
maximum displacements are also depicted. The contact domain elements are not shown. From 
this numerical simulation, the envelope for the maximum contact forces and also the stress 
distribution in the direction of the movement of the boulder can be extracted. 

 
Fig.2 An indicative PFEM post-process model and results (horizontal contact stresses and 
displacements) for the impact of a rectangular boulder on an elastic wall with an initial velocity 
of 5 m/s, for different steps of the analysis  

 

In the following section, the information from the numerical simulation is used in order to apply a 
representative pseudo-static force to the masonry wall domain that will represent the initial loading 
conditions for the next step of the procedure where a stress and failure analysis is performed. 

In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we present an example considering isotropic damage for the constitutive 
behaviour of the masonry wall. The collapse of the wall can be observed. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the 
same example, but with a different geometry for the boulder and isotropic damage for the 
masonry, is presented. It can be seen how the damage distribution and the contact surface 
experience a continuous change.  

The results of Fig. 7 indicated that the absorption of the energy for the different models is 
substantially different (Fig. 7). For the elastic model, the obtained contact time interval is longer. 
The energy is not damped and multiple rebounds occur. Therefore if we consider the elastic case  
we err on the side of caution.

2.2 Mechanical properties and masonry modelling   
The finite element modelling has been widely used for the stress-strain analysis of masonry walls, 
as it can provide a reliable distribution of masses along the structure and a realistic simulation of 
the inertia forces imposed on it (Syrmakezis et al. 2007).  

The out-of-plane analysis of masonry walls using the Finite Element Method FEM is performed 
herein. Lee et al. (1994) proved that the numerical modelling of masonry walls, subjected to lateral 
loading, assuming elastic-brittle behaviour, can efficiently predict their physical behaviour. This is 
also applied here. The three-dimensional modelling of the masonry is proposed. The most 
commonly employed finite element type for this purpose is the shell element. The modelling of 
masonry walls with a denser mesh near the rockfall application area is suggested. 

Computational modelling frameworks for masonry structures range from simplified to complex 
nonlinear finite element or discrete element models. In most cases the macro-level nonlinear finite 
element models and homogenisation techniques are adopted. Attention has also been given to 
other methodologies (discrete element method, rigid block spring method, lattice modelling, 
discontinuous deformation analysis, combined discrete/finite elements), which deal more directly 
with the discontinuous nature of structural masonry in a simplified micro modelling manner. In 
large and practice-oriented analyses, the information concerning the interaction between masonry 
blocks and mortar is usually negligible for the global structural behaviour.  Here, the finite element 
macro-modelling approach is followed, where the unit-mortar interfaces are smeared out in a 
homogeneous continuum. The macro-modelling strategy is thus used as distinct from the detailed 
micro-modelling and simplified meso-modelling ones, which consider the units and mortar 
distinctively (Lourenço 1996; Rots 1991).  

For periodic masonries (with repeated units of blocks and mortar) macro-elements can be used 
with equivalent properties (Mavrouli and Syrmakezis 2008). For each element, the material is 
assumed to be linear elastic, isotropic and damage-free before loading, with its elastic properties 
defined by the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The equivalent mechanical properties of the 
homogenised masonry (representing a composite of units and mortar) can be calculated 
according to Eurocode 6, CEN (2005) using the following expressions. The influence of the block 
size to the masonry properties was not considered here.

The modulus of elasticity Ec (Young modulus) is calculated as:  

Ec =1000 *fwc  (2) 

The rockfall action is applied as an external pseudo-static force corresponding to the maximum 
contact force stress calculated using the PFEM, and determined for each combination of wall 
(characterised by its width), and rock boulder (characterised by its width, height and velocity). It 
is applied here as an external uniform stress perpendicular to the wall. The application area is 
central on the wall, and its height and width are equal to the boulder dimensions.  

The resistance (strength) of the masonry is a parameter presenting high degree of uncertainty 
due to heterogeneity of the materials.  Given the impact velocity, the strain-rate effect is a further 
source of uncertainty. This variability can be contemplated using probabilistic approaches. The 
same applies for all variables intervening in the analysis that cannot be precisely determined.  

2.3 Failure analysis  
Failure analysis implies the use of a failure criterion for the definition of the damaged areas of a 
structure. Its selection is crucial for the determination of mechanical failure due to elastic 
deformation. When bi-dimensional assumptions are made, a modified Von Mises criterion, using 
the two produced principal stresses, can be employed based on the Von Mises Theory. 
Modifications of the original criterion took place by Syrmakezis and Asteris (2001) in order to be 
consistent with masonry structural properties. The modified failure criterion is a semi-empirical 
failure criterion, based on experimental results. 

The failure curve is formed by the interaction of four surfaces S1, S2, S3 and S4 as illustrated in 
Fig. 8 (section on the horizontal plane of zero shear stress). Each surface represents a certain 
biaxial stress state: S1 represents a compression state in parallel to both principal axes, S2 
describes a stress state of tension in parallel to one principal axis and a stress state of 
compression in parallel to the other, S3 represents a tension state in parallel to both principal axes 
and S4 is symmetrical to S2. An element is expected to fail when the applied direct and shear 
stresses specify a point on the circumference or outside the shaded area. The afore-mentioned 
curves are given by equations (3) to (6).

Failure analysis is carried out by application of the modified Von Mises failure criterion, introducing 
the max principal stresses (τ=0) that result from the application of the rockfall actions, at every 
shell of the finite element model. The “FAILURE” software has been developed in Fortan by 
Syrmakezis and Asteris (2001) especially for this purpose. 

“FAILURE” input data comprises three sets of information, specified for each plane: those 
concerning model definition, transformed stress analysis results on nodes and strength values in 
compression and tension. The stresses at every node and shell are checked against the failure 
criterion and the results are provided graphically, indicating which areas fail and the respective 
failure type (compression at both axes; compression at axis 1 and tension at axis 2; tension at 
axis 1 and compression at axis 2; tension at both axes). Graphical colour outputs of the failed 
areas are produced, for each plane. The percentage of the damage, expressing the percentage 
of the areas that fail, is additionally calculated by Equation (7).

2.4 Case studies  
To verify whether the proposed method for stress and failure analysis (sections 2.2 and 2.3) can 
reproduce realistically the failure patterns of a masonry wall that is subjected to a rockfall action, 
we analysed three real cases of rockfall impacts on buildings, all of them in the East Central 
Pyrenees.   

The velocity of the impact is not known in any of these cases. There is in-situ evidence that as 
the boulders were moving downhills and before hitting the buildings, they lost a considerable part 
of their energy due to impacts with the ground, fragmentation and friction energy loss. The 
evaluation of this loss is a complicated issue and due to this a reliable estimation of the impact 
velocity was not possible. Thus in these analyses, the impact velocity was not included for the 
determination of the rockfall actions as suggested at section 2.1. Instead, the impact action was, 
simplistically and conservatively, simulated as the inertia force resulting, from the free fall on the 
walls, equal to the product of the rock mass with the gravitational acceleration.  

The first case study is situated in Pont de Gullerí where a rockfall took place near the Sant Romà 
de Tavèrnoles village. The initial rockfall was about 2.5 m3, dropping from a height of 12 m and 
impacting on the ground before hitting the wall of a rubble masonry building, situated right at the 
bottom of the slope. The building and the breach in the wall are shown in Fig. 9. The wall width 
was 30 cm. The blocks were irregular natural stones of varying dimensions of some centimetres, 
and in most cases with their horizontal dimension considerably longer than the vertical one. The 
mortar was very thin and of poor quality.  

Some of the block fragments that were observed in the field, on both sides of the wall (inside and 
outside the building), were assumed to have been produced by the impact. There is in-situ 
evidence of the impact of the boulder on the rocky slope before flying and hitting the masonry.

The second case is a rockfall hit on a Roman church near the village Pessonada at the area of 
Pallars Jussà (Fig. 10). The structure was an ashlar masonry, with regular stone blocks of some 
centimetres and thin average quality mortar. In the area, there are several boulders from previous 
rockfall events, whose detachment has left visible on the slope face scars. A block of 0.25 m3 
impacted on the church wall, but no damage was caused.

The third case is the case of a rockfall which, in 2014, resulted in the impact of a block against a 
workshop in Santa Coloma, Andorra (Fig. 11). The initial rockfall fragmented into several 
boulders, one of which, of about 3.60 m3 damaged the workshop. The boulder impacted on the 
fence in front of the workshop before hitting the brick wall. The structure was a one-leaf clay brick 
masonry. The bricks were of standard dimensions of approximately 190 mm long x 90 mm wide 
x 90 mm high and cement mortar.

workshop  

 

The three finite element models were developed using the software SAP2000. The initial stress 
state in the walls, before the rock block hit, resulted from their self-weight. The characteristics of 
the masonry properties for each structure are shown in Table 1. These are: masonry type, width, 
tensile and compressive strength, and modulus of elasticity. They were calculated according to 
the section 2.2. The compressive strength of the blocks was set in approximate terms according

recommendations: for stone blocks and average construction quality at 50 MPa at Pont de Gullerí, 
for stone blocks and good construction quality at 75 MPa for Pessonada, and at 20 MPa for brick 
blocks.  The tensile strength of the masonry was defined according to the values proposed by 
EC6 for the characteristic initial shear strength, under zero compressive stress.  We considered 
dimensioned natural stone and mortar M1-M2 for the buildings at Pont de Gullerí and Pessonada, 
and clay masonry units (bricks) and mortar M2.5-M9 for the one at Santa Coloma.   

Table 2 resumes the impact characteristics that were used for the determination of the rockfall 
loading for each analysis: the block volume, the maximum impact stress and its application area.  
The application area of the impact force was defined by the interaction surface of the boulder with 
the wall, given the dimensions of each boulder. The impact stress was then determined 
distributing uniformly the impact force F over the application area.

The maximum stresses, resulting from the FEM for each wall, were defined. Their distributions 
are graphically presented in Fig.12, where the application area of the boulder action is also 
indicated. Using the FAILURE software the damaged areas of the wall were identified. The results 
are shown in Fig. 13. These figures indicate the zones where the resistance of the masonry is 
exceeded, according to the Modified Von Mises failure criterion. These results reproduce 
efficiently the observed damage patterns on the walls, suggesting that the proposed method can 
be used for the assessment of the expected damage due to rockfalls. Although the velocity has 
not been considered here for the back analysis of these events, in the next section we 
demonstrate its incorporation for the refinement of the calculation of the maximum forces applied 
on a masonry wall, when the velocity data are known.

3. Sensitivity analysis  
To assess the vulnerability of a masonry panel subjected to a rockfall, the determination of the 
key factors that affect its behaviour is required.  To this aim, a sensitivity analysis was performed 
to identify the model parameters exerting influence on the analytical results. The parameters 
(variables) that were analysed are: a) the masonry tensile strength, mainly related to the mortar 
tensile strength, b) the masonry compressive strength, mainly related to the blocks compressive 
strength, c) the wall width, d) the rock boulder diameter, and e) the rock boulder velocity.  

The sensitivity analysis was performed for a masonry wall of 10 m length and 3 m height. The 
simulation model was fixed at its base, while the other three sides were pinned, in order to 
simulate the effect of two lateral transversal walls and a roof slab. 

A range of values (Table 3) was assumed each time for one variable, which the rest of the 
variables were assumed constant. The ranges values were determined according to the values 
which are typically encountered for stone masonries in the literature (CEN 2005, MSJC 2008). 
The constant values were 0.15 MPa for the masonry tensile strength, 1.13 MPa for the masonry 
compressive strength, 0.6 m for the wall width and 1 m3 for the rock boulder volume. For the 
sensitivity analyses that were carried out with respect to the masonry tensile strength, the 
masonry compressive strength, the wall width, and the rock boulder volume, the rock impact 
action was equal to the inertia force resulting from the free fall on the walls, and the velocity was 



16 
 

not included into the calculations. However, for the evaluation of the effect of the rock boulder 
velocity the method described at section 2.1 was used. 

The proposed procedure was repeated to calculate the failure percentage for each case. Some 
indicative patterns of failure are depicted in Fig. 14. Fig. 15 presents the variation of the failure 
percentage for each variable.

The significance of each parameter was then determined by the Sensitivity Index SI (Equation 8) 
calculating the output difference (%) when varying one input parameter, from its minimum to its 
maximum value (Hoffman and Gardner, 1983; Bauer and Hamby, 1991): 

 

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝐷𝐷𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥 − 𝐷𝐷𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓𝑚𝑚 𝐷𝐷𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓𝑥𝑥
�  (8)  

 

where the indices Dmin and Dmax represent the minimum and maximum damage index values, 
respectively. Dmin and Dmax are obtained varying the input over its entire range (Hoffman and 
Gardner 1983). Values of the SI closer to 1 indicate higher importance of a variable.  

The results (Table 4) indicate that the most important factors affecting the masonry performance, 
are the masonry width and tensile strength, followed by the rock boulder volume and its velocity.  
The wall width was also indicated to be a very important factor especially for masonries thinner 
than 60 cm. For the compressive strength analyses, the damage did not experience any variation 
as the wall would first fail due to biaxial tensile strength.

4. Conclusions  
Rock boulder impacts on masonry buildings may cause variable damage. For big rockfall events, 
the loss is expected to be very high. Nevertheless for small and medium-sized events, this loss 
depends on the boulder magnitude and kinematics, as well as the building characteristics 
(geometry, materials, strength, supports…). Although the evaluation of the expected damage for 
buildings is necessary for the rockfall risk assessment, the methodologies that take these issues 
into consideration are scarce. In this paper a numerical method is proposed for the damage 
assessment. The simulation of real rockfall impacts on masonries indicates that the methodology 
can successfully reproduce the pattern of the damage and it can be used for damage prediction.  

This methodology has the advantage of taking into account all stages of the phenomenon.  In the 
first stage, the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is used to model the impact of the rock 
boulder with the masonry structure. This analysis provides an assessment of the maximum impact 
forces due to rockfall actions, in function of the velocity and the size of the boulders. The results 
of the performed analyses, provide an indication of the actions to be expected at similar rockfall 
impacts on masonries. These results should be carefully interpreted, as the analysis mainly aims 
at the provision of an indication of the response instead of a unique solution to a given problem. 

In the second stage, the structural performance is analysed in terms of structural damage. The 
FAILURE software was employed after the FEM analyses to detect the damage. The severity of 
the computed damage is determined by the percentage of the damaged area and accordingly of 
the zone that needs to be repaired. This percentage can be directly used for the quantitiative 
rockfall risk assessment.  

The sensitivity analysis indicates that the most important factors affecting the damage are in 
descending order the masonry width, the tensile strength, the block diameter and the block 
velocity.  The wall width is also one of the most important factors especially for masonries thinner 



19 
 

than 60 cm. The tensile strength plays a primary role in comparison with the compressive 
strength.  

The procedure presented herein, has been developed as a first step for the probabilistic 
vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings subjected to rockfalls, using fragility curves. 
However it can be a useful contribution for applications that involve the investigation of the out-
of-plane response of masonry walls, subjected to ballistic loading.
