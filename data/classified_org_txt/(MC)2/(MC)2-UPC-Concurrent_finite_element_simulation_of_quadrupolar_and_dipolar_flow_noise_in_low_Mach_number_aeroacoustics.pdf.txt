Abstract

The computation of flow-induced noise at low Mach numbers usually relies on a two-step hybrid methodolgy.
In the first step, an incompressible fuid dynamics simulation (CFD) is performed and an acoustic source
term is derived from it. The latter becomes the inhomegenous term for an acoustic wave equation, which is
solved in the second step, often resorting to boundary integral formulations. In the presence of rigid bodies,
Curle’s acoustic analogy is probably the most extended approach. It has been shown that Curle’s boundary
dipolar noise contribution does in fact correspond to the diffraction of the quadrupolar aerodynamic noise
generated by the flow past the rigid body. In this work, advantage is taken from this fact to propose an
alternative computational methodology to get the individual quadrupolar and dipolar contributions to the
total acoustic pressure. For any linear acoustic wave operator, the unknown acoustic pressure can be split
into its incident and diffracted components and be computed simultaneously to the incompressible flow
field, in a single finite element computational run. This circumvents the problem found in Curle’s analogy
of needing the total pressure at the body’s boundary, which includes the acoustic pressure fluctuations. The
latter cannot be obtained from an incompressible CFD simulation. The proposed unified strategy could be
beneficial for a large variety problems such as those involving noise generated from duct terminations, or
those related with the simulation of fricatives in numerical voice production, among many others.

1. Introduction

In the direct noise computation (DNC) approach to aeroacoustics (see e.g., [1]), aerodynamic noise is
straightforwardly obtained as a bypass product of the unsteady and/or turbulent flow motion, driven by
the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. However, DNC is only feasible for academic cases, and a few
industrial ones, due to its high computational cost. As a consequence, most computational aeroacoustics
(CAA) strategies to date have relied on hybrid approaches [2], which can be applied whenever there is no
important feedback from the acoustic field to the aerodynamic one. Hybrid approaches usually consist of
a first finite element (FEM), or finite volume, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to obtain
the aerodynamic velocity and pressure fields, from which some acoustic sources can be derived. The latter
are set as the inhomogeneous term of a wave equation that is solved to get the acoustic pressure field in a
second numerical simulation. The acoustic pressure is usually computed with the boundary element method
(BEM) if the sound pressure is to be found at long distances from the source region, though FEM is also
feasible if the computational domain is not too large [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

In this work, focus is placed on aeroacoustics at low Mach numbers. The most popular option for
unbounded flows probably is that of making use of Lighthill’s acoustic analogy [8]. First, an incompressible
CFD simulation is carried out and the double divergence of the Reynolds tensor is computed from it as an
approximation to Lighthill’s tensor (see [9, 10, 11] for a detailed justification). The latter is convolved with
the free-space Green function for the wave equation to get the acoustic pressure radiated by flow motion.
This allows one to identify the problem of flow noise emission with that of sound radiation by a distribution
of quadrupoles in free space. Though the most celebrated acoustic analogy is that of Lighthill, many other
analogies have been derived. Some emphasize the role of vorticity in aerodynamic noise production [12,
13, 14] while others attempt at transferring mean flow effects from Lighthill’s source term to the wave
operator (see e.g., [15] for a review and also [16]). Approaches standing on acoustic perturbation equations
(e.g., [17, 18, 19]) derived from linearization of the Euler equations (e.g., [11, 20]) are also quite common.

All the strategies in the precedent paragraph are intended for aerodynamic sound propagation in free
field. To consider the effects of bodies within the flow on aerodynamic noise, one could proceed analogously
to what is done for Lighthill’s acoustic analogy, but convolving the source term with a tailored Green function
that accounts for the body boundary conditions. The problem is that for complex geometries tailored Green
functions are not available. Curle [21] proposed a way out to this difficulty by identifying the influence of rigid
bodies with that of a distribution of surface dipoles. The free-space Green function can be used instead of
the tailored one, though at the price of taking into account a new source of sound in the simulations. Curle’s
formulation was extended for non-rigid bodies in the well-known Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation [22].

Unfortunately, when applied to low Mach number aeroacoustics, Curle’s formulation presents a problem.
The dipole surface integral term involves the gradient of the total pressure in the normal direction to the
boundary of the rigid body. The total pressure includes the acoustic fluctuations, which cannot be obtained
from an incompressible CFD simulation. Recently, it has been proposed to surpass this difficulty by just
considering the gradient of the incompressible flow pressure and by replacing the wave equation Green
function with that of the Laplacian operator [23]. Another strategy will be followed hereafter. This is based
on the observation that Curle’s analogy is actually a sharp way to account for aerodynamic noise generated
by surfaces, though what it is really happening, from a physical point of view, is that waves generated by
flow motion get diffracted by the rigid body [24, 25, 26].

In this paper, we take advantage of this fact and propose a methodology for the simultaneous computation
of the flow field, and of the turbulent and surface diffracted contributions to the total acoustic pressure field.
At each time step of the simulation, the flow incompressible aerodynamic velocity and pressure are obtained
by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and input into a wave equation for the acoustic
pressure, as if no rigid body was present. This computed acoustic pressure generated by the wake past
the body has a quadrupolar character and plays the role of an incident pressure field on the rigid body
boundary. Therefore, the incident pressure is used in turn to solve a wave equation for the acoustic pressure
diffracted by the rigid body, at the same computational time step. In this way, the complete time evolution
of the separate contributions to the acoustic pressure generated by flow motion (quadrupolar) and by surface
diffraction (dipolar) is obtained at the end of the simulation. All the partial differential equations involved
in this methodology have been solved by means of FEM, resorting to stabilization strategies when necessary.
A preliminary, short version of this work can be found in [27].

The paper is organized as follows. The basic theory and problem statement are presented in Section 2.
A reminder is made of Curle’s analogy as a diffraction problem and the proposed methodology for flow noise
computation is detailed for general wave operators. Section 3 focuses on the numerical approximation of the
Navier-Stokes and wave equations using FEM. The weak formulation of the equations is first exposed and
then we proceed to their space and time discretization. In Section 4, two numerical examples are presented.
The first one, used for verification and testing purposes, deals with aerodynamic noise generated by flow
past a two-dimensional cylinder (aeolian tones). The second one concerns noise produced by flow past a
sharp constraint at the exit of a three-dimensional rectangular duct. This second example is of importance
to analyze the physics involved, for instance, in the generation of voice sibilant sounds like /s/. Conclusions
close the paper in Section 5.

2. Problem statement

2.1. Curle’s analogy as a diffraction problem

As a motivation for this work, let us first review the connection between Curle’s analogy and the diffrac-
tion of aerodynamic sound by a rigid body. We will closely follow [26] for that purpose. Consider the
situation depicted in Fig. 1, where a low Mach, high Reynolds number gas flow impinges on a rigid body
Ωb and as a result, a wake develops past the body. The evolution of the aerodynamic velocity u

0(x, t)
and the aerodynamic pressure p0(x, t) will be driven to a good extent by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. These are to be solved in a computational domain ΩNS ⊂ R

d (where d = 2, 3 is the number of
space dimensions) with boundary ∂ΩNS and prescribed initial and boundary conditions. Splitting ∂ΩNS
into three disjoint sets ∂ΩNS = Γb ∪ ΓD ∪ ΓN , the mathematical problem to be faced reads

∂tu
0 − ν∆u0 + u0 · ∇u0 +∇p0 = f in ΩNS , t > 0, (1a)

∇ · u0 = 0 in ΩNS , t > 0, (1b)

u
0 (x, 0) = u00 (x) in ΩNS , t = 0, (1c)

u
0 (x, t) = 0 on Γb, t > 0, (1d)

u
0 (x, t) = u0D (x, t) on ΓD, t > 0, (1e)

n · σ (x, t) = tN (x, t) on ΓN , t > 0, (1f)

where ν stands for the kinematic viscosity and f for the external force. σ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and
n and tN respectively denote the outward normal at the boundary and the traction. ∂t denotes the first
order time derivative.

In his celebrated work, Lighthill [8] reordered the compressible Navier-Stokes equations into a wave
equation whose source term involved the double divergence of the so-called Lighthill’s tensor, Tij . In the
particular case of low Mach and high Reynolds numbers one can neglect viscous dissipation and refraction
in Tij , and approximate the tensor solely in terms of the incompressible velocities

with ρ0 standing for the flow constant density. According to Lighthill’s acoustic analogy we can then obtain

p (x, 0) = 0, ∂tp (x, 0) = 0 in Ωac, t = 0. (3d)

In (3), p represents the acoustic pressure and c0 the speed of sound. Γ∞ corresponds to the outer boundary
where a Sommerfeld like condition is to be imposed to avoid waves propagating outwards to reflect back
into the computational domain. Besides, it is assumed for the time being that the source term in the r.h.s
of (3a) vanishes outside ΩNS ⊂ Ωac (see section 2.3 for further considerations). The flow is therefore at rest
in Ωac \ ΩNS . On the other hand, we have used ∂i to denote the first order spatial derivative with respect
to coordinate xi, i.e., ∂i ≡ ∂/∂xi. The summation convention for repeated indices is also assumed in what
follows unless explicitly specified.

An integral solution to (3) could be found provided a tailored Green function G(x, t | y, τ) satisfying the
boundary conditions at Γb was known. This would result in the acoustic pressure field

Unfortunately, tailored Green functions are only available for bodies with very simple geometrical shapes.
In the particular case of the typical wavelength of the generated sound being larger than the body principal
dimension, one can make use of compact Green functions [28] and extend the number of situations where (4)
could be applied in practice. Nonetheless, for more general applications it would be desirable to find a way
out to solve (3) making use of the simpler free space Green function for the wave equation

where δ stands for the Dirac delta function. This was achieved by Curle [21] using an ingenious procedure,
which allowed one to identify the rigid body contribution to flow noise with that of a dipole source distribution
radiating into free space. Curle’s final integral formulation for the acoustic pressure reads

According to (6), the acoustic pressure at a far field point in Ωac \ ΩNS has two contributions, namely

the quadrupolar one directly stemming from flow motion (volume integral term in the r.h.s of (6)), and the
dipolar one due to the presence of the rigid body Ωb within the flow domain (surface integral term in the
r.h.s). However, as commented in the Introduction, a severe difficulty appears for low Mach number flows if
the acoustic source term is derived from an incompressible CFD computation. Whereas the incompressible
velocity in the volume integral of (6) can be readily obtained from the solution of (1), this is not the case for
the source term in the surface integral, because the integrand P involves not only the aerodynamic pressure
at Γb but also the acoustic pressure fluctuations on it. In [23], an approximation was proposed to circumvent
this problem that consists in making use of the incompressible pressure at the surface Γb and in replacing
the free field Green function for the wave equation (5) by that of the Poisson equation. An alternative to
that approach will be proposed hereafter that involves less assumptions. This is based on the fact that, as
noted by several authors (see e.g. [24, 25, 26]), the acoustic pressure contribution of the surface integral

4



in (6) corresponds to the diffraction of the aerodynamic noise produced, in the case of Fig. 1, by the flow
wake past the rigid body.

The tailored Green function in (4) can be decomposed as

G(x, t | y, τ) = GF (x, t | y, τ) +GD(x, t | y, τ), (7)

with GF being the free-space Green function in (5) and GD its diffracted (read also scattered) field correction
that accounts for the presence of boundaries. Substituting (7) into (4) results in

It becomes then apparent that the Curle surface integral, which represents an acoustic dipole source distri-
bution, does in fact correspond to the body diffraction of the turbulent noise generated by the flow wake.

2.2. Proposed methodology

In view of (8), one may consider the possibility of obtaining the individual flow quadrupolar turbulent
contribution as well as the dipolar one due to diffraction all at once, as the outputs of a single FEM
computational run. This would prove very useful in some aeroacoustics situations where the influence of each
type of sources is needed, for example, for noise reduction remedial purposes, or for a better understanding
of the underlying noise generation mechanisms of a given physical phenomenon.

Let us split the total acoustic pressure into its incident and diffracted components p = pi + pd in (3), as
commonly done for diffraction problems. This results in the two wave equations,

and

∂tpd on Γ∞, t > 0, (11c)

pd (x, 0) = 0, ∂tpd (x, 0) = 0 in Ωac, t = 0. (11d)

Because of the linearity of the problems, it is observed that pd + pi is the solution of problem (3),
restricting pi to domain Ωac.

Instead of resorting to an integral formulation, it is herein proposed to solve the problem of aerodynamic
sound generation by solving (1), (10) and (11) all together, in a single simulation. The weak form of these
equations will be discretized in space using FEM and in time using finite difference schemes. At each
time step of the simulation the incompressible velocity obtained from (1) will be used in (10) to compute
the incident acoustic pressure field (i.e., the direct quadrupolar contribution), which in turn will be used
in (11) to compute the diffracted pressure field (i.e., the direct dipolar surface contribution). Note that rigid
boundaries have been assumed in the above formulation though acoustic impedance conditions can easily
be taken into account, as it will be shown in the next subsection.

The depicted strategy avoids the problem of having to deal with the total pressure in the surface integral
of Curle’s analogy and independently provides the contributions pi and pd to the total acoustic pressure
p, which could not have been obtained from the direct FEM solution of (3). Alternatively, one could also
attempt at solving (3) and (10) and obtain the diffracted contribution by subtracting the incident acoustic
pressure field from the total one.

2.3. Generalization to other wave operators and sound sources

Though posing Curle’s analogy as a diffraction problem has motivated the approach in the preceding
section to compute the quadrupolar and dipolar contributions to aerodynamic sound, that methodology
can be generalized to other linear wave operators and source terms that include phenomena neglected in
Lighthill’s tensor approximation (2). Let us denote by L a generic linear wave operator acting on the acoustic
pressure p defined in Ωac, Bb a linear operator defining the boundary conditions at the rigid body (including
e.g., a prescribed impedance value at Γb) and B∞ a linear operator describing a non-reflecting boundary
condition at Γ∞. Q will stand for a generic aerodynamic source term obtained from an incompressible CFD
computation solving (1). Then, the aerodynamic noise problem of solving

Lp = Q in Ωac, t > 0, (12a)

∇p · n = Bbp on Γb, t > 0, (12b)

∇p · n = B∞p on Γ∞, t > 0, (12c)

p (x, 0) = 0, ∂tp (x, 0) = 0 in Ωac, t = 0, (12d)

can always be split using p = pi + pd as

Lpi = Q in Ωac ∪ Ωb, t > 0, (13a)

∇pi · n = B∞pi on Γ∞, t > 0, (13b)

pi (x, 0) = 0, ∂tpi (x, 0) = 0 in Ωac ∪ Ωb t = 0, (13c)

and

Lpd = 0 in Ωac, t > 0, (14a)

∇pd · n−Bbpd = −∇pi · n+Bbpi on Γb, t > 0, (14b)

∇pd · n = B∞pd on Γ∞, t > 0, (14c)

pd (x, 0) = 0, ∂tpd (x, 0) = 0 in Ωac, t = 0. (14d)

Equations (3), (10) and (11) are nothing but a particular case of (12), (13) and (14). Another example,
could be that of identifying L with the convective wave equation L ≡ [c−2

0
(∂t+U0 ·∇)

2−∇2] to account for
the effects of a uniform mean flow velocity U0 in the wave operator. With regard to the source term, one
could consider, for instance, the double time derivative of the incompressible pressure instead of the double
divergence of (2) as a source term, i.e., Q ≡ c−1

0
∂2ttp

0 (see e.g., [29]). The boundary condition operator
Bb could involve the admittance coefficient at the surface, µ, and be identified e.g., with Bb ≡ −µc

−1
0

∂t.
Besides, one could also attempt to extend the above procedure for the wave equation in mixed form [30],
or for the more complex acoustic perturbation equations [17], though this is out of the scope of the present
work.

Finally, we would like to note that in the case of dealing with N diffracting disjoint bodies instead of just
one, the problem becomes totally analogous to (13) and (14) if one is interested in knowing their quadrupolar
and dipolar contributions as a whole. One simply has to consider that for such situations Ωb =

⋃

j=1...N Ωbj
with

⋂

j=1...N Ω̄bj = ∅, each Ωbj representing the j-th diffracting or scattering body (depending on the
relation between wavelength and object characteristic size). An example of such a type would be that of
determining the noise generated by a grille at the exit of a ventilation system, or knowing the influence of
the upper and lower incisors in the voice generation of a fricative sound like /s/.

3. Numerical discretization

3.1. Continuous weak formulation

To present the numerical discretization of the proposed methodology we will focus on equations (1), (10)
and (11). Resorting to a FEM approach for the spatial discretization of these equations demands working

6



with their corresponding weak forms. Let us introduce some notation for that purpose. In what follows,
for any two functions (or distributions) f and g, the integral of their product over a domain ω will be
designated by (f, g)ω ≡

∫

ω
fg. This integral will typically represent a scalar product or a duality pair.

H1(ω) will represent the space of functions whose distributional derivatives belong to L2(ω). The vector
counterparts of all these spaces will be indicated by bold letters. The regularity in time of time-dependent
functions will not be explicitly displayed; it will be assumed that it is enough for the variational problems
written below to make sense.

Let us consider the Navier-Stokes problem. Let V be space of functions in H1(ΩNS) that satisfy the
Dirichlet boundary conditions on Γb and ΓD, and V0 be space of functions in H

1(ΩNS) that vanish on these
boundaries. The weak form of the Navier-Stokes equations (1) is found as usual by multiplying them by
a test function v0 for the velocity and q0 for the pressure, and integrating over the computational domain
ΩNS . The variational problem to be solved is that of finding [u

0(·, t), p0(·, t)] ∈ V × L2(ΩNS) for all t > 0
such that

(∂tu
0,v0)ΩNS + (u

0 · ∇u0,v0)ΩNS + ν(∇u
0,∇v0)ΩNS − (p

0,∇ · v0)ΩNS = (f ,v
0)ΩNS + (tN ,v

0)ΓN ,
(15a)

(q0,∇ · u0)ΩNS = 0, (15b)

for all [v0, q0] ∈ V0 × L
2(ΩNS), and supplemented with the weak form of the initial conditions in (1c).

Analogously, multiplying (10) by the test function q and integrating now over the domain Ωac ∪ Ωb we
get the variational problem of obtaining the incident acoustic pressure pi(·, t) ∈ H

1(Ωac ∪ Ωb) for all t > 0
which fulfills

(∂2ttpi, q)Ωac∪Ωb + c
2
0(∇pi,∇q)Ωac∪Ωb − c0(∂tpi, q)Γ∞ = (u

0 · ∇u0,∇q)Ωac∪Ωb , (16)

for all q ∈ H1(Ωac ∪Ωb). Again, the weak forms of the initial conditions (10c) are to be considered to solve
the problem.

Finally, the weak formulation for the diffracted acoustic pressure problem (11) becomes that of getting
the pressure pd(·, t) ∈ H

1(Ωac) for all t > 0 such that

(∂2ttpd, q)Ωac + c
2
0(∇pd,∇q)Ωac − c0(∂tpd, q)Γ∞ = c

2
0(∇pi · n, q)Γb , (17)

for all q ∈ H1(Ωac). In this case initial conditions (11d) have to be also appended to the variational form.

3.2. Spatial discretization

A FEM approach has been applied for the space discretization of all the involved variational equations
in the preceding section. Even though different finite element meshes can be used for the three problems to
be solved, we will write them all as {K}, K standing for a generic element of diameter h. Summation for
all the elements of the mesh will be written as

∑

K .
Let us first focus on the weak form of the Navier-Stokes equation in (15). For this case, it is well-

known that the standard Galerkin FEM solution suffers from many numerical problems. On the one hand,
a compatibility inf-sup condition has to be satisfied to control the pressure that does not allow one to use
equal interpolations for the incompressible velocity and pressure fields. On the other hand, instabilities also
appear in the case of strong convection as happens for high Reynolds number flows. Numerical instabilities
may also trigger at the early stage of evolutionary processes when using small time steps.

It is possible to solve the above difficulties by resorting to stabilized finite element approaches. In
particular, the subgrid scale stabilization methods (also known as variational multiscale stabilization meth-
ods) [31, 32] are of special interest for the simulation of turbulent flows. This is so because, if well designed,
they not only allow one to circumvent the above mentioned numerical problems, but also act as implicit
large eddy simulation models [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. The basic idea of subgrid scale methods is that of splitting
the problem unknowns, u0 and p0 for (15), and the test functions, v0 and q0, into large scale components,
u0h and p

0
h, which can be resolved by the computational mesh, and small scale components, ũ

0 and p̃0, which

7



cannot be captured and whose effects onto the large scales have to be modeled. Substituting u0 = u0h + ũ
0,

p0 = p0h + p̃
0, v0 = v0h + ṽ

0 and q0 = q0h + q̃
0 in (15) yields two coupled equations, one driving the dy-

namics of the large scales but containing the influence of the small scales, and the other one governing the
dynamics of the subscales, which in turn depend on the large scales. The solution to the latter is usually
approximated considering the subscales to be directly proportional to the residual (in the algebraic subgrid
scale (ASGS) version [31, 37]) or taking the residual component perpendicular to the finite element space
(in the orthogonal subgrid scale (OSS) approach [32]). The proportionality is characterized by means of a
matrix of the so-called stabilization parameters.

For the simulations in the present work we have resorted to the ASGS formulation, assumed quasi-static
subscales and neglected the influence of the pressure subscales. Let Vh ⊂ V be the finite element space for
the velocity, Vh,0 ⊂ V0 for the velocity test functions and Qh ⊂ L

2(ΩNS) for the pressure and pressure
test functions. The space-discrete variational problem for the large scales then becomes that of finding
[u0h(·, t), p

and c1 and c2 in (15) standing for algorithmic parameters. From numerical experiments the values c1 = 4
and c2 = 2 have been deemed appropriate for them. The influence of the subscales ũ

0 has been neglected in
the non-linear term of the residual in (19), and in the stabilization parameter as well. Subscales are assumed
to vanish at the interelement boundaries.

Observe that the first two lines of (18) are nothing but the Galerkin FEM approach to the variational
Navier-Stokes problem, whereas the third line contains the subscale contributions to the material derivative,
as well as the stabilization terms which mitigate the numerical problems mentioned above. The reader is
referred to [35] for a detailed derivation of the above equations. These arise as a particular case of the most
general situation in which subscales are tracked in time and all its non-linear contributions retained.

In what concerns the wave equations, (16) and (17) do not present special spatial discretization difficulties
because they only involve the Laplacian operator. A standard Galerkin FEM proves accurate enough. Let
Vih ⊂ H

1(Ωac ∪ Ωb) and Vdh ⊂ H
1(Ωac) be finite element spaces to approximate problems (16) and (17),

respectively.
The spatial discrete version of (16) is that of finding pih(·, t) ∈ Vih for all t > 0 which satisfies

The main numerical difficulties with (21) and (22) usually arise from its time discretization (to be dealt
with in the forthcoming subsection) or from undesired reflections at the boundary of the finite computational
domain. Although simple Sommerfeld radiation conditions have proved precise enough for the numerical
tests in the present study, the use of perfectly matched layers (PML) for the irreducible wave equation is
certainly recommendable [38, 39, 40].

Finally, we point out that to get the matrix versions of the above equations one has to expand as usual
the unknowns u0h, p

0
h, pih, pdh, and their corresponding test functions, as linear combinations of polynomial

basis functions and nodal unknowns, and rearrange (18), (21) and (22). Needless to say that the equations
are to be supplied with the corresponding discrete initial conditions in weak form.

3.3. Fully discretized numerical scheme in space and time

To approximate the first and second order time derivatives in (18), (21) and (22) backward finite difference
schemes of second order (BDF2) and of third order (BDF3) have been used. To fix notation, let us describe
the former. Consider a partition of the time interval [0, T ] into N equal time steps of size δt := tn+1 − tn

so that 0 ≡ t0 < t1 < . . . < tn < . . . < tN ≡ T . Given a generic time dependent function g(t), the following
notation will be used for the BDF2 approximation to the first order time derivative:

∂tg|tn ≈ δtg
n :=

1

2δt
(3gn − 4gn−1 + gn−2), (23)

whilst the BDF2 second order time derivative will be approximated by

∂2ttg|tn ≈ δ
2
ttg

n :=
1

δt2
(2gn − 5gn−1 + 4gn−2 − gn−3). (24)

As usual, gn denotes an approximation of the evaluation of g at time step tn.
Given that the proposed concurrent FEM formulation for aeroacoustics is not intended for sound prop-

agation at very far distances (for which an integral approach would probably be more efficient), the above
BDF2 time discretization schemes prove accurate enough for the wave problems. Otherwise, if acoustic
wave propagation was required for distances involving several tenths or hundreds of wavelengths, one should
resort to high-order schemes (e.g., fourth order Runge-Kutta [41, 42]) or to symplectic integrators (e.g. of
the Verlet-type).

At an arbitrary time step of the numerical simulation, the final fully discretized implicit scheme in space
and time proposed to solve equations (3), (10) and (11) reads as follows. From known u

Usually, knowing the acoustic field generated by the initial transients of the NS equations is of no interest

at all, so the acoustic module in the above scheme (equations (26) and (27)) gets activated after a certain

period of time. On the other hand, note that at each time step of the simulation a linearization process
is needed for the convective term in the NS equations. This can be achieved either by means of a simple
Picard’s scheme or by a Newton-Raphson’s one.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the proposed strategy presents a somehow tricky point because the
computational domains for the variational NS equation (25) and for the two wave equations (26) and (27)
are not the same. At each time step of the simulation, after solving (25) the domain Ωb has to be switched
on and included for the computation of the incident acoustic pressure in (26), and then switched off to
compute the diffracted sound field in (27). Besides, it should be noted that special care should be taken
when interpolating the results from the CFD domain to the acoustic one to avoid spurious errors [43, 44, 45].

4. Numerical examples

4.1. Aeolian tones

To test the above proposed methodology we will first address the classical case of aeolian tones induced
by flow vortex shedding past a cylinder. The characteristic Reynolds number of the problem is Re = U0D/ν,

10



Figure 3: Evolution of the diffracted pressure at points (20 m, 0◦), green line, (20 m, 45◦), blue line and (20 m, 90◦) red line.

with U0 denoting the mean velocity impinging on the cylinder and D its diameter. As long as Re is increased
from an almost zero value, a set of bifurcations take place until the flow past the cylinder becomes fully
turbulent at high enough Reynolds numbers (see e.g., [46]). Our interest is on that range of Re where the flow
first loses its steadiness and a set of periodic vortices form behind the cylinder, known as the Von Kármán
vortex street. The vortices are shed at an approximate frequency of fsh = StU

0/D, with St denoting the
Strouhal number that slightly depends on Re as St = 0.198(1−19.7/Re) (see e.g., [47]). The wake of vortices
generate aerodynamic quadrupolar noise which is diffracted by the cylinder. The diffracted noise exhibits
a strong dipolar character that clearly determines the acoustic pressure in the far field. The emitted sound
has a dominant frequency of fsh. Aeolian tones can be appreciated in practice when wind impinges power
transmission lines and are also emitted, for instance, by train pantographs and tubular heat exchangers.

For the simulations we have considered a two-dimensional cylinder with diameter D = 0.1 m embedded
in a circular acoustic computational domain Ωac that has a diameter of DΩac = 50 m. An inner rectangular
domain ΩNS of dimensions 5 m× 10.4 m has been used for the CFD computation. An inlet flow velocity of
U0 = 50 m/s has been prescribed in the horizontal direction on its Dirichlet boundary, which has resulted in a
vortex shedding and emitted sound frequency of 120 Hz. We have considered a sound speed of c0 = 343 m/s.
The two-dimensional mesh for ΩNS consists of 55 881 linear finite elements while 194 322 linear elements have
been used for the acoustic domain Ωac. A time step of δt = 10

−4 s has been chosen for the time evolution.
The variational equations (15), (16) and (17) have been solved following the explanations in Sections 3.2
and 3.3.

Representative snapshots at time instant t = 0.3 s of the generated acoustic pressure field have been
plotted in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2a we present the incident acoustic pressure field generated by the vortex wake which
exhibits a clear quadrupolar directivity pattern. We remind that this computation is done in Ωac ∪ Ωb as if
the cylinder was absent. The incident acoustic pressure is diffracted by the cylinder which emits aerodynamic
sound with a dipole pattern. The colour scale in Fig. 2a has been set different from that in Fig. 2b to better
observe the quadrupolar radiation. It is to be noted that the amplitude of the diffracted sound turns to
be ∼ 6 − 7 times stronger than the incident one, which is in accordance with the fact that the dipolar
contribution is of order M−1 times the quadrupolar one (see e.g., [26]). In the present example the Mach
number is M ≈ 0.146.

The total acoustic field has been plotted in Fig. 2c. As observed, except for the area just past the
cylinder, the results in Fig. 2c almost totally match those in Fig. 2b confirming that the far field is governed
by the dipolar diffracted noise. This can also be appreciated in Fig. 3, where we have plotted the acoustic
pressure evolution at three points located at distances and angles with respect to the horizontal of (20 m, 0◦),
(20 m, 45◦) and (20 m, 90◦) from the center of the cylinder. The acoustic pressure takes its maximum

4.2. 3D duct exit with sharp constraint

The second application case focuses on the validation of the presented method for a benchmark test
employed for better understanding the aeroacoustics in the generation of the sibilant sound /s/. The test
consists of a duct with a sharp edge obstacle stuck at the end, which may be roughly viewed as a very
idealized representation of a vocal tract and the teeth [48]. When the flow passes through the gap left by
the constriction a turbulent wake develops driven by a shedding frequency. This results in the generation of
aerodynamic noise which becomes diffracted by the teeth. As it will be shown, it will be again this diffracted
noise component the one that dominates the far field acoustics.

The computational domain for both, the CFD and acoustic computations, consists of a three dimensional
rectangular duct with dimensions 10.2 cm× 2.5 cm× 2.5 cm and a hemisphere at its exit, 15 cm in radius,

to account for outward acoustic wave propagation. The teeth is placed close to the duct exit leaving a gap
of 0.15 cm× 2.5 cm which corresponds to 6% of the duct section (see Fig. 4). The thickness of the edge of
the teeth is 1.25 mm. As regards the CFD computation, an inlet velocity of (2.4, 0, 0)⊤ m/s is imposed for
the air at the duct entrance whereas a no-slip boundary condition is prescribed on its walls. The Reynolds
number according to the height of the teeth gap and the inlet velocity is Re = 300. In what concerns the
acoustic simulations, the duct walls have been assumed to be rigid and a Sommerfeld boundary condition
has been imposed at the outer surface of the hemisphere. The computational mesh is made of 42 550 677
tetrahedral linear finite elements with 6 798 782 nodes, using equal interpolation for velocity and pressure.
A second order fractional step scheme has been used to solve the incompressible Navier Stokes equations,
using a biconjugate gradient solver with a Hypre Pilut preconditioner for the velocity and a Trilinos ML
one for the pressure. The later has been also used for the acoustic computations. In what refers the time
discretization, a BDF3 scheme has been used for the CFD simulations and a BDF2 for the wave equation.
The time step is given by δt = 2× 10−6 s. The CFD has been first run for 1000 steps to surpass the initial
transients without triggering the acoustic module. Both, CFD and acoustic results have been then computed
from the subsequent 2000 time steps. All simulations have been performed using 1024 processors of a PDC
Beskow machine at the KTH (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan) supercomputing center.

As a result of the CFD computation, and as mentioned above, a turbulent wake develops past the teeth
with some dominating shedding frequencies, the most important one taking place at 6 kHz. In Fig. 5 we show
a snapshot of the isovorticity surfaces of the flow just past the teeth where the formation of coherent vortex
structures can be appreciated. In Figs. 6a and c, we respectively present a vertical cut (at z = 0.0125 m) and

a horizontal cut (at y = 0.0032 m) for the velocity modulus, whereas the analogous ones for the aerodynamic
pressure are given in Figs. 6b and d. All of them are plotted at t = 0.006 s. In Fig. 7 we show the pressure
spectrum Epp in a log-log plot for a point located at the flow wake. According to Kolmogorov’s theory,
Epp ∼ k

−7/3, k being the wavenumber, and making use of the frozen-turbulence approximation (Taylor’s
hypothesis) it can be shown that the dependency with frequency also becomes Epp ∼ f

−7/3 (see e.g., [49, 50]).
The slope −7/3 is plotted as a red line in Fig. 7. As it can be observed, the computed spectrum closely
matches the Kolmogorov pressure spectrum prediction for fully developed isotropic turbulence.

The generated aerodynamic sound results in acoustic waves propagating outside the duct exhibiting a

spherical directivity pattern (see Fig. 8). In Fig. 9a and b we respectively plot the incident and diffracted
acoustic pressure for the plane located at y = 0.0032 m. The influence of the wake is apparent for the
incident field whereas it is logically absent for the diffracted acoustic field. Again, we should remind that
the incident acoustic field computation is carried out by removing the teeth from the computational domain.
It is to be noted that Lighthill’s source term becomes strongly concentrated at the wake past the teeth and
quickly smears out when the flow leaves the duct (see Fig. 10).

One can easily check that it is the noise diffracted by the teeth the one that governs the acoustics at the
far field, in accordance with theoretical models for sibilant sound production (see e.g., [51]). In Fig. 11a we
have plotted a sample of the total, incident and diffracted time history for the acoustic pressure at a point
located at the far field. As observed, the diffracted component almost justifies the total acoustic pressure
at this point. In Fig. 11b we present the Fourier transform for the incident and diffracted acoustic pressure
evolution. The diffracted spectrum presents a clear peak at 6 kHz, corresponding to the dominant shedding
frequency in the turbulent wake (see Fig. 7). This frequency determines the main oscillations observed in
the diffracted and total pressure evolution in Fig. 11a.

Finally, it should be remarked that despite of the present example being able to reproduce the basic

mechanism of sibilant sound generation, the obtained spectrum differs from those of realistic experimental
data, obtained from human being recordings. For instance, in [52] several frequency spectra of phoneme /s/
were recorded for different different languages, syllables, ages and gender. The spectra in that study were
rather flat within the range of 2− 10 kHz, peaking slighthly between 6.8− 8 kHz. It is expected that when
running the current simulations using realistic human vocal tract geometries for sibilant /s/ the obtained
spectra will be closer to the measured ones. Yet this is out of the scope of the current work and it is left for
future developments.

5. Conclusions

This paper suggests a methodology to obtain the turbulent quadrupolar contribution to aerodynamic
flow noise, as well as the dipolar one due to the influence of rigid body surfaces, as a direct output of a single
finite element computational run. To that purpose use is made of Lighthill’s acoustic analogy, although
as shown, the procedure can be extended to any other acoustic linear wave operator and acoustic source
term. Instead of directly solving the wave equation for the acoustic pressure, the latter becomes split into
an incident component, due to flow motion, plus a diffracted one, due to the presence of bodies within the
flow. At each time step of the simulation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved and an
approximation to Lighthill’s tensor is derived from them. This source term is inserted in a wave equation
for the incident pressure that is solved as if the rigid body was absent for that time step. This provides the
quadrupolar flow noise contribution. The value of the incident pressure at the boundary of the rigid body
is then used to compute the dipolar acoustic pressure contribution due to the body’s diffraction.

The proposed approach avoids the problem of the standard Curle formulation for low Mach number
aeroacoustics, of knowing the acoustic pressure fluctuations in the surface integral, not just the incompressible
pressure that could stem from an incompressible CFD simulation.
