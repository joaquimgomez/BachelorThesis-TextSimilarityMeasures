Abstract

In previous works, the authors have presented the stabilized mixed displacement/pressure
formulation to deal with the incompressibility constraint. More recently, the authors have
derived stable mixed stress/displ-acement formulations using linear/linear interpolations to en-
hance stress accuracy in both linear and non-linear problems. In both cases, the Variational
Multi Scale (VMS) stabilization technique and, in particular, the Orthogonal Subgrid Scale
(OSS) method allows the use of linear/linear interpolations for triangular and tetrahedral ele-
ments bypassing the strictness of the Inf-Sup condition on the choice of the interpolation spaces.
These stabilization procedures lead to discrete problems which are fully stable, free of volumetric
locking or stress oscillations.
This work exploits the concept of mixed �nite element methods to formulate stable displace-

ment/stress/pressure �nite elements aimed for the solution of nonlinear problems for both solid
and �uid �nite element (FE) analyses. The �nal goal is to design a �nite element technology
able to tackle simultaneously problems which may involve isochoric behaviour (preserve the
original volume) of the strain �eld together with high degree of accuracy of the stress �eld.
These two features are crucial in nonlinear solid and �uid mechanics, as used in most numerical
simulations of industrial manufacturing processes.
Numerical benchmarks show that the results obtained compare very favourably with those

obtained with the corresponding mixed displacement/pressure formulation.

1 Introduction

This work presents a novel �nite element technology with enhanced stress accuracy and, at the
same time, able to deal with the fully incompressible behavior. Stress accuracy and performance in
the incompressible limit are two requirements which often coexist when addressing the numerical
simulation of di¤erent industrial manufacturing processes such as metal forming, forging, extrusion,
friction stir welding, cutting or machining operations, among many others. The accuracy of the
solution obtained by the numerical simulation of such industrial processes is directly related to the
ability of the �nite element technology adopted to deal with complex phenomena such as strain
localization, the formation of shear bands, the prediction of crack propagation or the isochoric
behavior of the inelastic (plastic) strains (fully deviatoric response of metallic materials under large
deformations).

In the literature, the incompressible limit case and stress accuracy enhancement are generally
treated separately. The problem posed by the incompressibility is to avoid the so called volumetric
locking, an undesirable e¤ect exhibited by �nite element approximations based on the standard
Galerkin approach. Successful strategies to avoid volumetric locking based on mixed formulations
([29], [2]), enhanced assumed strain methods ([33], [34], [7], [32], [28]) and nodal pressure and strain
averaging ([24], [8], [9], [10], [35]) can be found in the literature.

Techniques based on the Variational Multi Scale (VMS) approach proposed by Hughes [26]
have been applied in the context of solid mechanics in strain localization problems (see [27]). More
recently, a method based on the mixed displacement/pressure formulation with Orthogonal Sub
Scales (OSS) stabilization technique, introduced by Codina [22], has been applied to incompressible
elasticity by the authors (see [20]). E¤ectiveness and robustness of this mixed displacement/pressure
technique encouraged the authors to extend this approach to non-linear problems (see [13], [21] and
[1]) and to strain localization analysis using both J2 plasticity and J2 damage constitutive models
([14], [15] and [16]). This FE technology has shown a good performance in the case of softening
behavior of the material once the elastic limit is reached. In this case, strains concentrate into
slip-lines allowing for sliding movements and the mixed formulation is able to capture such strain
localization with practically mesh independent solutions.

However, even if the incompressible limit has been successfully tackled, the accuracy of the
stress �eld approximation was still an open issue solved by local mesh re�nement (see [31]).

Lately, the authors have proposed a mixed stress/displacement formulation which uses lin-
ear/linear interpolations for both master �elds. Also in this case, the strictness of the inf-sup
condition [11], when the standard Galerkin method is applied to mixed elements, imposes severe
restrictions on the compatibility of the interpolations used for the displacement and the stress �elds
(see [30] and [3, 4] for the analysis of admissible elements in linear elasticity). This di¢ culty can
be circumvented again adopting a VMS approach which adds a consistent (reduced upon mesh
re�nement) residual-based stabilization to the original problem. This mixed stress/displacement
�nite element technology has demonstrated enhanced stress accuracy in both linear and non-linear
analysis as well as the ability to capture stress concentrations and strain localizations with the
guarantee of stress convergence upon mesh re�nement. This is an essential requirement which
cannot be accomplished in a point-wise manner using the standard Galerkin displacement-based
formulation. An accurate estimation of the stress �eld even in the strain localization zone drives
the crack propagation without the help of ad-hoc tracking algorithms.

2



The present work makes a step forward introducing a mixed three-�eld formulation based on dis-
placement/stress/pressure elements with linear (or, in general, equal) interpolations for all master
�elds. The only requirement is the split of the constitutive equation into volumetric and deviatoric
parts (more details in Section 3). Once more, the stabilization technique to overcome the Inf-sup
condition is presented in terms of the VMS method. The di¤erent assumptions and approxima-
tions used to derive this novel �nite element technology are proposed in a very general format,
applicable to 2D and 3D problems. Section 4 deals with the implementation and computational
aspects. Finally, Section 5 shows the performance of the proposed formulation comparing with the
well established mixed displacement-pressure formulation.

2 The continuum problem statement

Let us denote by 
 an open and bounded domain in Rndim where ndim is the number of dimensions of
the space, and @
 its boundary. The boundary @
 is split into @
u and @
t, being @
 = @
u[@
t
such that the prescribed displacements, u, are speci�ed on @
u (Dirichlet boundary conditions)
and the prescribed tractions, �t, are applied on @
t (Neumann boundary conditions).

The continuum mechanical problem of linear elasticity to be considered is de�ned by the fol-

lowing system of equations:

r � � + b = 0 (1)
� � C : " = 0 (2)
"�rsu = 0 (3)

These are 3 equations with 3 unknown �elds: the displacements, u (x) and both the stress and
the strain �elds, � (x) and " (x), respectively, de�ned at each point, x, of the continuum.

Eq. (1) is the balance of momentum equation, where b represents the external load per unit
of volume and r � (�) is the divergence operator. Eq. (2) is the constitutive equation for linear
elasticity. Note that Eq. (2) may also correspond to the secant form of a non-linear constitutive
equation, where C is the 4th order (secant) constitutive tensor. Finally, Eq. (3) is the kinematic
equation (in the hypothesis of in�nitesimal strains), where rs (�) = 1

2

h
r (�) +r (�)T

i
denotes the

symmetric gradient operator and r (�) is the gradient operator.
There are di¤erent alternatives to solve problem (1� 3) with the corresponding appropriate

boundary conditions described.
The classical displacement-based formulation is obtained by substituting Eqs. (2) and (3) into

Eq. (1). The result is Navier�s equation

r � (C : rsu) + b = 0 (4)

which is written in terms of the displacement �eld only.
Alternatively, the mixed u=� formulation uses both stresses and displacements as master �elds

as:

r � � + b = 0 (5)
� � C : rsu = 0 (6)

obtained by substituting Eq.(3) into Eq.(2).

3 The volumetric/deviatoric split

The objective of this section is the split of the constitutive equation (2) into its volumetric and
deviatoric parts. This is possible in the cases of linear elasticity (compressible or incompress-
ible), J2-plasticity (both small and large strain hypotheses), isotropic damage, Newtonian and
non-Newtonian �ows as Norton-Ho¤, Sheppard-Wright, Bingham visco-plastic �ow, among others.
The volumetric/deviatoric split is the starting point to develop a formulation able to tackle the
incompressible limit.

3.1 Volumetric and deviatoric operators

Let us de�ne the 4th rank volumetric and deviatoric tensors, V and P, as follows:

V =
1

3
(I
 I) (7)

P = I�
1

3
(I
 I) (8)

P+ V = I (9)

where I = [�ij�kl] and I = [�ij ] are the 4th rank and the 2nd rank identity tensors, respectively (�ij
is Kronecker�s delta). V and P can be also thought as operators acting on second order tensors by
taking double contraction with them. In this case, V and P are orthogonal projectors, that is:

V : P = P : V = 0 (10)
P : P = P (11)
V : V = V (12)

3.2 Split of stress and strain tensors

Using V and P operators, it is possible to extract the spheric and the deviatoric parts of a generic
2nd order tensor. Particularly, when applied to the stress tensor, �, the result is:

V : � =
1

3
(I
 I) : � = p I (13)

P : � =
�
I�

1

3
(I
 I)

�
: � = � � p I = s (14)

where p (�) = 1
3
(� : I) = 1

3
tr (�) is the pressure and s (�) = P : � = dev (�) are the deviatoric

stresses. On one hand, the stress tensor, �, is symmetric and consists of 6 independent components.
On the other hand, the deviatoric stress tensor, s, is also de�ned by 6 components but only 5 of
them are independent, as the deviatoric stresses must respect the constraint: tr (s) = 0. This poses
the question of how to select a frame independent (not unique) basis for the deviatoric stress tensor.

This given, the stress tensor can be rebuilt adding both components of the split as:

� = p I+ s (15)

In a similar way, it is possible to split the strain tensor, ", as:

4



V : " =
1

3
(I
 I) : " =

1

3
evol I (16)

P : " =
�
I�

1

3
(I
 I)

�
: " = "�

1

3
evol I = e (17)

where evol = tr (") is the volumetric deformation and e = dev (") accounts for the distortions. The
resulting split format of the strain tensor is:

" =
1

3
evol I+ e (18)

3.3 Split of the kinematic equation

Within the hypothesis of in�nitesimal strains the kinematic equation is expressed as:

" = rsu (19)

Applying the volumetric/deviatoric operators, equation (19) is split as follows:

evol = r � u (20)

e = P : rsu = rsu�
1

3
(r � u) I (21)

Adding the volumetric and the deviatoric components, the kinematic equation is rebuilt as:

" =
1

3
(r � u) I+ P : rsu (22)

3.4 Split of the constitutive equation

Let us assume that the constitutive relationship between stresses and strains can be expressed, in
secant form, as:

� = C : " (23)

Then the spheric and the deviatoric parts of the constitutive tensor, Cvol and Cdev, respectively,
are obtained as:

Cvol = V : C (24)
Cdev = P : C (25)
C = Cvol + Cdev (26)

Introducing the split of stresses and strains ((15) and (18), respectively), the constitutive rela-
tionship in (23) can be written as:

(p I+ s) =
�
Cvol + Cdev

�
:

�
1

3
evol I+ e

�
(27)

5



that is:

p = Cvol evol (28)

s = Cdev : e (29)

which are the volumetric and the deviatoric counterparts of the original constitutive equation, being
Cvol = 1

9
I : Cvol : I the bulk modulus of the material.

Particularizing to linear isotropic elasticity, the constitutive tensor is given by:

C = K (I
 I) + 2G
�
I�

1

3
(I
 I)

�
(30)

where K is the (elastic) bulk modulus and G is the (elastic) shear modulus. Therefore, the spheric
and the deviatoric parts of the elastic constitutive tensor (30) are:

Cvol = V : C = 3K V = K (I
 I) (31)

Cdev = P : C = 2G P = 2G
�
I�

1

3
(I
 I)

�
(32)

and Cvol = K.
Making use of the compliance (�exibility) tensor, D = C�1, it is possible to express the strains

in terms of the stresses as:
" = D : � (33)

Therefore, the spheric and the deviatoric components of the �exibility tensor (particularized to
linear elasticity) are:

Dvol = V : D =
1

3K
V (34)

Ddev = P : D =
1

2G
P (35)

D = Dvol + Ddev (36)

Introducing the split format of the stresses (Eq. (15)), the strains (Eq. (18)) and the split of
the �exibility tensor (Eq. (36)) into Eq. (33), the result is:�

1

3
evol I+ e

�
=
�
Dvol + Ddev

�
: (p I+ s) (37)

where it is possible to identify the volumetric and the deviatoric expressions of the original consti-
tutive equation (33):

evol = D
vol p (38)

e = Ddev : s (39)

being Dvol = I : Dvol : I the compressibility modulus.

6



Finally, making use of the kinematic equations (20) and (21), the previous relations translate
into:

r � u = Dvol p (40)
P : rsu = Ddev : s (41)

and, in the incompressible limit Dvol ! 0, they reduce to:

r � u = 0 (42)
P : rsu = Ddev : s (43)

Observe that the constitutive relationship in the split format above consists of 6 equations (the
same as for equation (27)). In fact (28) is a single equation while (29) develops into 5 equations.

The particularization to linear elasticity is:

r � u =
p

K
(44)

P : rsu =
1

2G
s (45)

and, in the incompressible limit, K !1, they reduce to:

r � u = 0 (46)

P : rsu =
1

2G
s (47)

4 The u=s=p three-�eld formulation

In this section, a novel three-�eld formulation is introduced. The objective is the de�nition of
a general framework, which includes the well-known mixed u=p formulation and the mixed u=�
formulation as particular cases. To this end, let us de�ne the mixed u=s=p formulation, which uses
the displacement �eld, u, together with the deviatoric component of the stresses, s, and the pressure
�eld, p, as independent variables. Hence, the governing equations of the problem are rewritten as:

r � s+rp+ b = 0 (48)
P : rsu� Ddev : s = 0 (49)
r � u�Dvol p = 0 (50)

where Eq.(48) is the balance of momentum equation in mixed form. The 5 equations in (49)
together with the scalar equation in (50) are the deviatoric and the volumetric counterparts of a
generic constitutive equation as presented in (41� 40).

The weak form of the mixed u=s=p formulation reads:

(v;r � s) + (v;rp) + (v;b) = 0 in 
 (51)

(�;P : rsu)�
�
�;Ddev : s

�
= 0 in 
 (52)

(q;r � u)�Dvol (q; p) = 0 in 
 (53)

7



where v (vector), q (scalar) and � (a tensorial �eld of 5 independent components) are the variations
of the displacement, the pressure �eld and the deviatoric stresses, respectively, and (�; �)D denotes
the integral of the product of two functions in a domain D, which is omitted when D � 
.
Integrating Eq.(51) by parts and taking v = 0 on @
u, the problem can be written as:

0 + (rsv; s) + (r � v; p) = F (v)

(�;P : rsu) �
�
�;Ddev : s

�
+ 0 = 0

(q;r � u) + 0 � Dvol (q; p) = 0

(54)

where
F (v) = (v;b) + (v;�t)@
t (55)

is the work of the external loads.
Problem (54) involves the �rst derivatives of u (x). Hence, the natural space for the continuum

displacements �eld is: u (x) 2 V = H1 (
)ndim . Hm (
) denotes the space of functions whose
derivatives (up to order m � 0) belong to L2 (
). The corresponding variations are de�ned in:
v (x) 2 V0 = fv (x) 2 V j v = 0 for 8x 2 @
ug.

The pressure �eld, p, and its variation, q, belong to space Q = L2 (
), while the natural
space for deviatoric part of the stress �eld, s, and its variations, �, is bS = fs (x) = [sij (x)] ;
sij = sji 2 L2 (
) j tr (s) = 0

	
for x 2 
. Other functional settings could be considered by chang-

ing the terms integrated by parts. In fact, the formulation that yields optimal stress convergence
for equal interpolation for all the unknowns requires more regularity on the stresses. We will not
treat this issue in this work (see [5] for similar ideas in the context of Darcy�s problem).

Problem (54) is complemented by the Dirichlet boundary conditions in terms of the prescribed
displacements, u.

Remark 1 To achieve symmetry, it is possible to substitute the second term in the �rst equation,
(rsv; s), by the equivalent term: (P : rsv; s). Then, problem (54) reads:

0 + (P : rsv; s) + (r � v; p) = F (v)

(�;P : rsu) �
�
�;Ddev : s

�
+ 0 = 0

(q;r � u) + 0 � Dvol (q; p) = 0

(56)

Remark 2 Alternatively, the second equation in (56) can be tested using the test functions,  =
q I+ � with q 2 Q and � 2 bS, in the form:

(;P : rsu)�
�
;Ddev : s

�
= 0 (57)

This equation is equivalent to the original one because the extra terms, (q I;P : rsu) and
�
q I;Ddev : s

�
,

are null by construction. However, Eq.(57) develops into 6 scalar equations being only 5 of them
linearly independent. Eq.(57) admits as a solution a stress �eld, ŝ, where tr (̂s) 6= 0 is not de�ned.

8



To overcome this inconvenient, it is necessary to prescribe the volumetric part of the stress �eld ŝ.
One possibility is to add the term

�
;Dvol : ŝ

�
to Eq. (57), which corresponds to the weak form of

the constraint: tr (̂s) = 0. The result is the following equation:

(;P : rsu)� (;D : ŝ) = 0 (58)

and problem (56) can be reformulated as:

0 + (P : rsv; ŝ) + (r � v; p) = F (v)

(;P : rsu) � (;D : ŝ) + 0 = 0

(q;r � u) + 0 � Dvol (q; p) = 0

(59)

where the stress �eld, ŝ, is deviatoric in a weak sense only.

5 Discrete approximation for the three-�eld formulation

5.1 Galerkin approach

Let us now de�ne the discrete Galerkin �nite element counterpart of problem (56) as:

0 + (P : rsvh; sh) + (r � vh; ph) = F (vh)

(�h;P : rsuh) �
�
�h;D

dev : s
�

+ 0 = 0

(qh;r � uh) + 0 � Dvol (qh; ph) = 0

(60)

where the discrete displacements, uh, and the corresponding test functions, vh, are de�ned in the
�nite-dimensional subspaces Vh � V and V0;h � V0, respectively. The approximate counterpart of
the stress �eld, sh and the pressure �eld, ph, together with their variations, �h and qh, belong to
the �nite element spaces bSh � bS and Qh � Q, respectively. Standard conforming approximations
are considered.

In the following, we will be interested in continuous �nite element spaces Vh, bSh and Qh and,
more speci�cally, in equal interpolation for displacements, stresses and pressures.

From the computational point of view, it is interesting to adopt Voigt�s notation, which trans-
forms the tensorial format of a generic symmetric tensor into a 6�dimensional vector. In the
Cartesian system, the stress and strain tensors are expressed using Voigt�s notation as:

s =
�
sxx syy szz sxy sxz syz

�
= [si] (61)

" =
�
"xx "yy "zz xy xz yz

�
= ["i] (62)

where ij = 2"ij are the so-called engineering strains.
Let nnod be the number of nodes per element of the �nite element partition. Then, Uh =

�
UAi
�

is an array of dimension 3nnod with 3 components (lower subindex, i) of displacements at each
node (upper subindex A) of the �nite element. Similarly, Sh =

�
SAi
�
is an array of dimension 6nnod

9



with the 6 components of the deviatoric stresses per node. Finally, Ph =
�
PA
�
is the array with

the nodal values of the pressure �eld. The approximations of the master �elds within each element
result in:

uh = NuUh =
�
NAI(3�3)ijU

A
j

�
(63)

sh = NsSh =
�
NAI(6�6)ijS

A
j

�
(64)

ph = NpPh =
�
NAPA

�
(65)

where, denoting by NA the shape functions of the selected element type used in the FE partition,
Nu is a 3 � 3nnod matrix made of nnod blocks of the form NAI(3�3). Similarly, Ns is a 6 � 6nnod
matrix made of nnod blocks of the form N

AI(6�6) and Np =
�
NA

�
, with A running from 1 to nnod.

The components of the deviatoric stress tensor Sh are not independent, as the trace of the

tensor is null. This condition can be imposed through a linear dependency matrix, H =
h
HABij

i
,

(6nnod � 5nnod), so that Sh = HbSh. This given, bSh = hbSAi i results in an array of dimension 5nnod
with 5 independent components of the deviatoric stress tensor at each node of the �nite element:

sh = NsSh = Ns

�
HbSh� = (NsH) bSh = bNsbSh (66)

where bNs = NsH.
Remark 3 Taking into account that tr

�
SA
�
= 0, one of the normal components of the deviatoric

tensor may be selected as redundant. For instance, it may be written that SAzz = �SAxx � SAyy. This
leads to a dependency matrix de�ned by nnod � nnod identical blocks of the form:

HAB =

2
664

1 0
0 1
�1 �1

03�3

03�2 I3�3

3
775 (67)

Note that the selection of the redundant normal deviatoric stress component is arbitrary.

The following arrays are also introduced (for the 3D case):

tively. On the other side, B =

and BT stand for the (discrete) symmetric gradient and

divergence (of a tensor �eld expressed in Voigt�s notation) operators, respectively.
The elemental sti¤ness matrix (upper subindex (e) denotes a generic element of the FE dis-

cretization) of the algebraic form of problem (60) is:

operator of rank two used to extract the deviatoric component of a symmetric tensor (expressed in
Voigt�s notation), being 1 =

Observe that the stress tensor at each node of the element, SA, is deviatoric in weak sense only.

5.2 Variational-Multi-Scale Stabilization technique

The stability of the discrete formulation depends on compatibility restrictions on the interpolation
functions chosen for the displacement, stress and pressure �elds, as stated by the appropriate inf-sup
condition (see [11]). According to these restrictions, mixed elements with continuous equal order
linear interpolation for all �elds are not stable. However, the inf-sup condition can be circumvented
by using a stabilization technique.

In this work, the Variational-Multi-Scale (VMS) method is introduced to stabilize the discrete
formulation of the mixed problem allowing for the use of linear interpolations for all master �elds.

The basic idea of the VMS approach is to enlarge Galerkin�s space of approximation, Wh =
Vh � Sh �Qh, adding a �ner resolution space, fW = eV0 � eS � eQ, referred to as the sub-grid scale.
Subindex (�)0 means that the sub-grid scale de�ned for the displacement �eld, (de�ned at element
level) vanishes at all the element boundaries.

Therefore, the enhanced approximation space is de�ned as:

W 'Wh �fW !
8<
:
u ' uh + eu
s ' sh + es
p ' ph + ep (72)

where Wh and fW represent two di¤erent levels of resolution: one coarse and a �ner one.
In order to ensure consistency of the stabilized mixed formulation, so that the discrete solution

converges to the continuous solution on mesh re�nement, the sub-grid scale is expressed in terms

11



of the residual of the projected (Galerkin) counterpart of Eqs.(48� 50), (see [23] for motivation)

eu = e�u Rhu = e�u [r � sh +rph + b] (73)es = e� s Rhs = e� s : hP : rsuh � Ddev : shi (74)
ep = e�p Rhp = e�p hr � uh �Dvolphi (75)

In the incompressible limit, Dvol ! 0 so that Rhp = r � uh and the pressure subscale reduces
to: ep = e�p Rhp = e�p [r � uh] (76)

The stabilization parameters:

e�u = �u I3�3  �u = cu Lh
2 bGe� s = � s Cdev  � s = cs hLe�p = �p eCvol  �p = cp hL

This given, the solution of the compressible problem is approximated as:

s ' sh + es = (1� � s) sh + � s hCdev : rsuhi (79)
p ' ph + ep = (1� �p) ph + �p hCvolr � uhi (80)

while in the incompressible limit, equation (80) reduces to:

p ' ph + ep = ph + �p h eCvolr � uhi (81)
Remark 5 The sub-grid scale contributions are discontinuous but, even if they are computed
element-wise, they cannot be condensed at element level, because [eu;es; ep] depend on the �elds
[uh; sh; ph], which are interelement continuous.

Remark 6 The magnitude of the sub-grid scales decreases upon mesh re�nement: as the �nite
element scale becomes �ner, the residuals reduce. In other words, the sub-grid scales [eu;es; ep] are
�small� compared to the �nite element �elds [uh; sh; ph].

Remark 7 It is interesting to observe that both the volumetric and the deviatoric components
of the stress �eld are expressed as the "blending" of the continuous �elds (sh and ph) with the
element-by-element discontinuous stress components, Cdev : rsuh and eCvol (r � uh), respectively.
The stability of the solution is ensured by adding those �small� discontinuous contributions to the
continuous �elds.

6 The mixed u=� formulation: the incompressible limit

The three-�eld formulation assumes the pressure �eld as an independent variable of the problem.
Doing this, the volumetric and the deviatoric components of the constitutive equation can be
treated independently. The pressure �eld is interpolated separately from the deviatoric part of the
stress tensor. This is particularly appealing in the incompressible limit, when the volumetric part
of the constitutive equation transforms into a purely kinematic constraint of the problem, while
conserving the accuracy induced by the nodal interpolation of the (deviatoric) stress �eld.

In this Section, the mixed u=� formulation is re-written to accomplish the incompressibility
constraint. Staring from the strong format of the u=� formulation in (5� 6), and taking advantage
from the split of the �exibility tensor into its volumetric and deviatoric components (see Eq. (36)),
the result is:

r � � + b = 0 (91)

where Ddev : (P : �) = Ddev : � because P is an idempotent operator.
Compared to the three-�eld formulation, here the pressure is computed as a function of the

stress �eld as

As a consequence, the above equation is enforcing (in weak form) the deviatoric part of the consti-
tutive equation as well as the incompressibility constraint, that is:

P : rsu� Ddev : � = 0 (97)
r � u = 0 (98)

Remark 10 In problem (95), the volumetric part of the stress tensor, tr (�), is determined up to
a constant that need to be �xed through Neumann�s boundary conditions.

Remark 13 The stabilization matrices for both the compressible and incompressible cases can be
(formally) obtained summing the second and third rows and columns of the corresponding matrices
de�ned for the three-�eld formulation, and assuming the same (discrete) interpolation functions
for both the pressure and the deviatoric stress �elds as well as the same stabilization parameters:
�� = � s = �p. Thus, the u=� formulation can be considered a particular case of the u=s=p
formulation. The latter allows one to approximate independently the deviatoric and volumetric
parts of the stress, whereas in the former they are limited by the stress approximation chosen.

7 Numerical results

In this section, the mixed three-�eld formulation presented in this work is tested in a number of
numerical benchmarks. The objective is to show the performance of the proposed �nite element
technology in terms of both displacement and stress �eld accuracy and its rate of convergence upon
mesh re�nement.

For the sake of brevity, the incompressible linear elasticity case is studied, although the results
can be extended to more complex non-linear constitutive behaviors (allowing for the volumet-
ric/deviator split).

Full incompressibility (Poisson�s ratio: � = 0:5) is assumed for the di¤erent numerical tests.
The performance of the proposed method is compared with the behavior of the mixed displace-
ment/pressure formulation (see [20]). The same displacement sub-grid scale stabilization (�u =
cu

h2

2G
with cu = 1:0) is adopted for both the u=p and u=s=p formulations, while the stress sub-grid

has been introduced in the u=s=p formulation assuming: � s = cs
h
L
with cs = 1 and �p = 0.

Calculations have been performed with an enhanced version of the �nite element code COMET
(see [12]) developed by the authors at the International Center for Numerical Methods in Engi-
neering (CIMNE).

7.1 Plane strain Cook�s membrane problem

The Cook�s membrane problem is a bending dominated benchmark used by many authors to test
their element formulations (see [34], [19], among others). The problem consists of a tapered panel,
clamped on the left hand side and subjected to a shearing load (f = 1) at the right end. Initial
geometry of this plane strain problem is shown in Figure 1. Material data have been assigned
in terms of Young�s modulus: E = 200 and Poisson�s ratio: � = 0:5. For the evaluation of the
stabilization parameters in the mixed u=s=p formulation the characteristic length is taken equal to
50.

In order to test the convergence behavior of the di¤erent formulations, the problem has been
discretized into a series of regular mesh re�nements with 2�2, 4�4, 8�8, 16�16, 32�32, 64�64,
128 � 128 and 256 � 256 elements per side. Both structured quadrilateral and triangular meshes
have been tested. In Figure 2 the 16� 16 quadrilateral and triangular meshes are shown.

Figure 3 compares the performance of the u=s=p vs. u=p formulations. It shows how they both
converge to the reference values (best value obtained with the 256�256 quadrilateral mesh using the
u=s=p formulation) on mesh re�nement. The performance is monitored reporting the displacement
of the top right corner (point A in Figure 1) and both the J2 deviatoric stress and pressure value
at the mid point of the bottom side of the Cook�s membrane (point B in Figure 1). Note that the

17

u=p formulation computes the stresses (locally) at the Gauss points (Figure 4 (a)) while the u=s=p
formulation adopts a continuous stress �eld (Figure 4 (b)). To compare stress accuracy, a local
smoothing technique has been applied to the original discontinuous stress �elds of the mixed u=p
formulation. So, Figure 3 presents the continuous values obtained after the smoothing operation.

Results in Figure 3 clearly show that both the u=s=p and the u=p formulations deal appropriately
with the incompressibility constraint but the three-�eld formulation exhibits a higher convergence
rate in the stress �elds. This translates into an enhanced stress accuracy of the proposed formulation
even for very coarse meshes. The same considerations apply for both triangular and quadrilateral
mesh discretizations.

For the sake of completeness, Figure 3 also shows results obtained for the bilinear displace-
ment/constant pressure Q1P0 element ([33]) and the bilinear displacement with enhanced strains
Q1E4 element ([34]). These two elements can only approach the incompressible limit, so a value
of Poisson�s ratio � = 0:4999 has been used. The same local smoothing technique has been applied
to the discontinuous stress �elds that these elements produce. Both quadrilaterals perform satis-
factorily on these regular structured meshes, showing an accuracy comparable to that of the mixed
u=s=p formulation. However. the �nite element formulations behind these two elements cannot be
extended to triangular and tetrahedral meshes.

7.2 Cantilever beam

Let us now consider a beam of unit thickness (plane-strain analysis) subjected to a bending moment
imposed at right end side by means of a linear normal traction distribution (the maximum traction
values is f = 10), as shown in Fig. 5.

Both the horizontal and vertical displacements are prescribed at the bottom corner of the left
hand side. The horizontal displacement is also �xed at the upper corner. The exact solution of this

where u (x; y) and v (x; y) are the horizontal and vertical displacements (0 � x � L and 0 � y � H).
The beam length is L = 10 and its height is H = 2. Young�s modulus is set to E = 200 and

Poisson�s ratio to � = 0:5. For the evaluation of the stabilization parameters in the mixed u=s=p
formulation the characteristic length is taken equal to H.

To assess the accuracy of the proposed formulation, the vertical displacement at the top corner
(A) of the right side of the beam is monitored (the analytical value is v (10; 2) = 0:375), as well as
the maximum horizontal normal stress and the mean stress (pressure) at the mid-point (B) of the
bottom side (the analytical values are �xx = 2 and p = 1, respectively).

The computational domain has been discretized into a series of orthogonal re�ned meshes with
1� 5, 2� 10, 4� 20, 10� 50 and 100� 500 quadrilateral elements (see Fig. 6).

The performance of the proposed three-�eld formulation is shown in Figure 7 and compared to
that of the displacement/pressure formulation. The enhanced accuracy of the proposed formulation
is clearly demonstrated. Using very coarse meshes such as the 2 � 10 mesh (only 2 elements in
the thickness), the error is less than 5% for the top corner displacement and less that 1% for both
horizontal stress and pressure values.

Figure 8 depicts the vertical displacement along the top side of the beam using di¤erent mesh
resolutions for both the u=s=p and u=p formulations. The analytical solution is given by the

Once again, the behavior of the proposed formulation shows a great degree of accuracy even for
very coarse meshes.

Sensibility of the proposed formulation against element distortion is tested by comparing the
above results on orthogonal meshes with those obtained on slanted meshes (see Fig. 6). Table 1
compares errors on maximum vertical displacements, horizontal normal stress and pressure obtained
with the u=p and u=s=p formulations on the 10� 50 orthogonal and slanted meshes. The accuracy
of the proposed u=s=p formulation is almost insensitive to distortion. This is not the case for u=p
formulation, where accuracy on stress and pressure deteriorates with slanting.

As a last example, the vertical stretching of a square V-notched specimen, shown in Figure 9, is
considered. Dimensions of the sample are 2 � 2 (width � height) and the V-shaped notch has a

length of 1 and a maximum width at the boundary of 0:02. For the evaluation of the stabilization
parameters in the mixed formulation, L = 2 is taken as representative length of the problem.
Uniform vertical displacements of opposed sign are imposed at the top and bottom boundaries.

Figure 9: Geometry for the sharp V-notched specimen under tension

In the continuous elastic problem associated to this situation, the strain and stress �elds are
singular at the tip of the sharp notch. The discrete model corresponding to the u=p �nite element
formulation performs satisfactorily in terms of a global error norm, but approximates very poorly
the actual behavior near the singular points.

To show this, a coarse structured mesh consisting of 8� 8� 2 u=p triangles with a �45o bias is

constructed. Figure 10(a) depicts contour-�ll of the maximum principal stresses computed on this
mesh. Note the strong mesh bias dependence that is observed in front of and behind the notch tip.
In fact, the largest values of the stresses occur behind the tip (left of the tip in the Figures), rather
than in front of it (right of the tip in the Figures). Computed stress directions near the tip of the
crack also show strong mesh bias dependence (see Figure 10(b)). These severe local errors caused
by the mesh alignment are not alleviated by mesh re�nement.

Figures 10(c)-(d) show corresponding results obtained using the stabilized mixed u=s=p formu-
lation on the same mesh. The improved accuracy with respect to the u=p formulation is clear. In
particular, the maximum principal stress value is detected exactly at the tip of the notch; computed
stresses directions are also noticeably improved. The importance of these two features in nonlinear
solid and �uid mechanics is evident. As it is shown in reference [18], they are crucial in strain

25



localization problems where the constitutive equation depends on the principal stress values and
their directions.

8 Concluding remarks

This paper shows that it is possible to tackle problems involving the incompressibility constraint
(including the limit case of Poisson�s ratio � = 0:5) while, at the same time, achieving a remarkable
degree of accuracy of the stress �eld.

The proposed three-�eld formulation is convergent upon mesh re�nement, virtually free of any
volumetric or shear locking. The technology is suitable for engineering applications in 2D and 3D
and for both triangular (tetrahedral for 3D analysis) or quadrilateral (or hexahedral in 3D) meshes.

Numerical examples show the remarkable degree of accuracy (even for coarse meshes) for both
displacement and stress �elds.

The proposed element technology can easily be extended to more complex non-linear material
behaviors allowing for the spheric/deviatoric split of the constitutive equations, such as incom-
pressible J2-plasticity.
