Abstract: AM processes are characterized by complex thermal cycles that have a deep influence
on the microstructural transformations of the deposited alloy. In this work, a general model for the
prediction of microstructure evolution during solid state transformations of Ti6Al4V is presented.
Several formulations have been developed and employed for modeling phase transformations
in other manufacturing processes and, particularly, in casting. The proposed model is mainly
based on the combination and modification of some of these existing formulations, leading to a
new overall model specifically dedicated to AM. The accuracy and suitability of the integrated
model is enhanced, introducing new dedicated features. In fact the model is designed to deal
with fast cooling and re-heating cycles typical of AM processes because: (a) it is able to consider
incomplete transformations and varying initial content of phases and (b) it can take into account
simultaneous transformations.The model is implemented in COMET, an in-house Finite Element
(FE)-based framework for the solution of thermo-mechanical engineering problems. The validation of
the microstructural model is performed by comparing the simulation results with the data available
in the literature. The sensitivity of the model to the variation of material parameters is also discussed.

1. Introduction

Compared to traditional forming processes, AM metal deposition is characterized by successive
thermal cycles with unusual ranges of cooling and heating conditions. According to the process
parameters and to the deposition strategy, these thermal cycles present different ranges of temperatures
in each point of the part. The local thermal cycles are also strongly influenced by the distance
from the heat source, which is continuously moving according to the metal deposition sequence.
The complex temperature evolution directly influences the kinetics of microstructure formations during
the solidification and the solid state transformations. As the thermal environment is not constant,
the resulting microstructures are inhomogeneous despite constant manufacturing parameters [1].
In fact, peripheral areas of the deposited metal present different thermal conditions if compared
with massive areas, causing differences in the grain orientation and size. The high cooling rates,
typical of fast AM thermal cycles, can lead to the formation of metastable martensitic structures.
However, due to the heat accumulation during the successive depositions, a bulk temperature
increment can take place, allowing for partial or complete martensite dissolution. This leads to
unique microstructural and mechanical properties, different from cast or wrought parts obtained
from identical alloy compositions [2]. If compared with casting, parts obtained by AM are usually
characterized by finer microstructure due to high cooling rates. On one hand, finer microstructure
can lead to higher tensile properties, on the other hand, typical AM defects such as microporosity and
oxide inclusions can cause a decrease of elongation at break [1,3,4]. The evaluation of local mechanical

properties of parts obtained by metal deposition is one of the main challenges when modeling AM
processes. The correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties is an effective approach
to this industrial requirement. Data for these empirical correlations can be found in the literature for
most of the alloys employed in mechanical applications (such as for Ti6Al4V [5]) but a dedicated work
of characterization is still to be done for several others alloys.

In this work, a model for the prediction of microstructure evolution of Ti6Al4V during AM
processes is presented. The main phase evolutions that take place during the solid state transformations
of Ti6Al4V are considered, both for cooling and re-heating conditions. A phenomenological approach
is employed, allowing to directly correlate the local temperature-time curves with the evolution of the
phase fractions. The models considered for each specific phase transformation are similar to the ones
used for similar processes such as welding, casting or heat treatments. Medium-slow diffusional phase
transformations are modeled by means of Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equations [6],
using the additivity rule [7] and considering the Temperature-Time-Transformation (TTT) curves as
material data input. In the case of fast diffusionless transformations (such as martensite formation),
empirical evolution laws are employed [8,9].

The model is specifically designed in order to take into account the typical conditions of AM
processes. During these processes, heating and cooling transformations take place several times due to the
thermal cycles generated by the layer-by-layer metal deposition sequence. Most of the times, these cycles
are so fast that the transformations remain incomplete. Dedicated algorithms that switch on and off each
transformation according to the AM process conditions, taking into account incomplete transformations
and varying initial fractions for each transformation, are considered very rarely in the literature [10,11].
In this paper, additional features are introduced, such as simultaneous transformations as well as the
martensite accumulation throughout the cycles. The microstructural model is validated comparing the
simulations results with experimental or numerical data available in the literature.

The model has been implemented in COMET, a Finite Element (FE)-based framework used for the
thermo-mechanical simulation of metal deposition processes [12–14]. Using COMET, the welding path
is modeled by means of an ad-hoc activation methodology that switches on the elements according
to the scanning sequence. The numerical results of temperature evolution during the AM process
provide the thermal inputs to predict the microstructure in each point of the part.

Therefore, the objective of this work is to enhance the numerical simulation of AM by developing
and calibrating dedicated models for the microstructure evolution of Ti6Al4V.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, a short review of the state-of-the-art of
microstructural modeling for Ti6Al4V is reported. In Section 3, the overall formulation of the
microstructural model specifically developed for AM processes is given. In Section 4, the sensitivity
analysis of the model to material data for different conditions is reported. Finally, a work of validation
of the model for 3D microstructural simulations of AM with different process parameters is presented.

2. Microstructure Evolution of Ti6Al4V

Depending on the temperature evolution, titanium can present two main crystal
structures: the beta phase (β), a Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) structure stable at high temperatures,
and the alpha phase (α), an Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure stable at low temperatures and
normally present at room temperature. During the cooling of liquid titanium alloys, β grains start to
nucleate and grow. After the complete solidification, the solid state transformation from β to α takes
place. In Ti6Al4V alloys, the Vanadium acts as β stabilizer element, allowing for the presence of a
little stable fraction of β phase at room temperature. Hence, at room temperature, Ti6Al4V alloy is
characterized by a mix of α + β phases that can show a large variety of microstructures and features
depending on the thermal cycles experienced. The most typical microstructures of Ti6Al4V alloys are
shown in Figure 1 [15,16]:

– Widmanstätten αw structure (Figure 1a): It is composed by α lamellae, with a small retained amount
of intra-lamellar β, enriched by vanadium, typical of slow-medium cooling rates. α lamellae



Metals 2018, 8, 633 3 of 21

are usually aligned to form colonies. A slight variant of this structure, characterized by thinner
lamellae, is called “basket-weave” structure. In this work, no difference is made between these two
structures and we will refer to them as Widmanstätten structures.

– Grain boundary αgb (Figure 1b): an allotriomorph crystal structure generally located at the β
grains boundaries.

– Martensite αm (Figure 1c): it is a non-equilibrium phase with acicular shape similar to small needles,
typical of fast cooling rates. There exists a variant of this structure called massive alpha, typical of
medium-fast cooling rates, but, in this work, this difference is not considered. Both Martensite
and Massive alpha present HCP crystal structure.

For the sake of simplicity, in the following the structural components described above will be
referred to as phases even if is not the proper metallurgical terminology.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, a short rewiev of the state-of-the-art of
microstructural modeling for Ti6Al4V is reported. In section 3, the overall formulation of the
microstructural model speci�cally developed for AM processes is given. In section 4, the sensitivity
analysis of the model to material data for di¤erent conditions is reported and, �nally, an example
of results from a 3D microstructural simulation of AM process is presented.

2 Microstructure evolution of Ti6Al4V

Depending on the temperature evolution, titanium can present two main crystal structures: the
beta phase (�), a Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) structure stable at high temperatures, and the alpha
phase (�), an Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure stable at low temperatures and normally
present at room temperature. During the cooling of liquid titanium alloys, � grains start to nucleate
and grow. After the complete solidi�cation, the solid state transformation from � to � takes place.
In Ti6Al4V alloys, the Vanadium acts as � stabilizer element, allowing for the presence of a little
stable fraction of � phase at room temperature. Hence, at room temperature, Ti6Al4V alloy is
characterized by a mix of �+� phases that can show a large variety of microstructures and features
depending on the thermal cycles experienced. The most typical microstructures of Ti6Al4V alloys
are shown in Figure 1 [12],[13]:

- Widmanstätten �w structure (Fig. 1a): It is composed by � lamellae, with a small retained
amount of intra-lamellar �, enriched by vanadium, typical of slow-medium cooling rates. � lamellae
are usually aligned to form colonies. A slight variant of this structure, characterized by thinner
lamellae, is called "basket-weave" structure. In this work, no di¤erence is made between these two
structures and we will refer to them as Widmanstätten structures.

- Grain boundary �gb (Fig. 1b): an allotriomorph crystal structure generally located at the �
grains boundaries.

- Martensite �m (Fig. 1c): it is a non-equilibrium phase with acicular shape similar to small
needles, typical of fast cooling rates. There exists a variant of this structure called massive alpha,
typical of medium-fast cooling rates, but, in this work, this di¤erence is not considered. Both
Martensite and Massive alpha present HCP crystal structure.

For the sake of simplicity, in the following the structural components described above will be
referred to as phases even if is not the proper metallurgical terminology.

According to Charles and Lindgren [10], during the cooling of Ti6Al4V, three different main
transformations take place: solidification of β phase from the liquid, β → α + β solid state
transformation and αm martensite formation.

Below liquidus temperature, β phase starts to form. Depending on the cooling conditions, β grains
can show equiaxed or columnar morphologies [17].

Following the cooling, when the β-transus temperature Tβtrans (around 995–1000 ◦C) is reached,
the α phase starts to form from the previous β phase. Generally, slow cooling rates lead to
Widmanstätten structures. The β → α + β diffusion-controlled transformation can be modeled
by means of a Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation [6], using the additivity rule [7].
JMAK equations are defined by temperature-dependent parameters that can be extracted from
Temperature-Time-Transformation (TTT) curves. The α lath thickness is inversely proportional to the
cooling rate and it can be modeled by an empirical Arrhenius equation [18,19].

In case of faster cooling rates, martensite αm can form from the residual β still available once
reached the martensite start temperature Tm (around 650–500 ◦C). This transformation is considered
diffusionless and can be modeled using the Koistinen-Marburger law, an empirical relationship which
depends on the undercooling with respect to Tm [8]. Note that if the transformation of β into αw is
complete, then no β fraction is available for the martensitic transformation.

In the case of reheating, three different transformations can occur: dissolution of martensite into
α + β, transformation of α into β and remelting of β.

The martensite αm is a metastable structure that tends to re-transform, at high temperature and
given sufficient time, to more stable α + β structures similar to the Widmanstätten microstructure.
In several models, these new α structures are generally referred to as αw Widmanstätten structures [15].
In [20], Gil Mur proposes to model the αm → αw + β transformation with JMAK equations using the
same additivity rule principle proposed for the Widmanstätten αw formation. An inverse correlation
between hardness and martensite content in Ti6Al4V is also proposed. Then, from the evolution of the
hardness in martensitic samples reheated at different levels of temperature, it is possible to extract



Metals 2018, 8, 633 4 of 21

the experimental parameters to characterize the JMAK equations to model the martensite dissolution.
This transformation starts at low temperatures: the martensite dissolution start temperature Tmdiss is
around 350–400 ◦C (see [20]).

During heating, above the α transus temperature Tβstart (600–650 ◦C), the total alpha phase
(α = αw + αm) starts to re-transform into β phase. Considering the high heating rates of AM processes,
α → β transformation can be approximated (together with the re-melting of β) as an instantaneous
transformation which follows the equilibrium phase diagram [21]. However, other approaches for
β recovering have been adopted in literature, such as the additivity rule with JMAK equations or a
temperature dependent parabolic law as proposed by Kelly [9].

3. Microstructure Evolution Model

3.1. General Formulation for Diffusion-Controlled Transformations

The classical JMAK model, as well as those modifications necessary to consider the incomplete
transformations and the existence of initial phase fractions, are presented in this section. The inverse
formulation to define the empirical parameters needed by the JMAK equations is shown.
Next, the principle of additivity rule is detailed.

3.1.1. Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov Equation

The JMAK (Johnson-Mehl [22]-Avrami [6]-Kolmogorov [23]) formulation is used to model
diffusion-controlled transformations. Typically, a sigmoidal (or s-shaped) time evolution of
the transformation starts slowly, continues relatively fast and slows down again at the end of
the transformation. This function suits the typical phases formation: nucleation, growth and
grain impingement.

The following form of the JMAK model [6] describes a complete evolution of a generic phase
fraction X from 0 to 1 :

X(t) = 1− e−kt
p

(1)

where k, p are material parameters which control the duration and the speed of the transformation and
t is the time from the start of the considered transformation. Two JMAK phase evolution calculated
with different k, p parameter are shown in Figure 2 (red and blue dashed lines). The same evolution
law can be written in rate form by differenciating Equation (1):

Ẋ(t) = kptp−1e−kt
p

(2)

3.1.1 Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation

The JMAK (Johnson-Mehl[19]-Avrami[3]-Kolmogorov[20] formulation is used to model di¤usion-
controlled transformations. Typically, a sigmoidal (or s-shaped) time evolution of the transforma-
tion starts slowly, continues relatively fast and slows down again at the end of the transformation.
This function suits the typical phases formation: nucleation, growth and grain impingement.

The following form of the JMAK model [3] describes a complete evolution of a generic phase
fraction X from 0 to 1 :

X(t) = 1� e�kt
p

(1)

where k; p are material parameters which control the duration and the speed of the transformation
and t is the time from the start of the considered transformation. Two JMAK phase evolution
calculated with di¤erent k; p parameter are shown in Figure 2 (red and blue dashed lines). The
same evolution law can be written in rate form by di¤erenciating Eq. (1):

_X(t) = (p� 1)ktpe�kt
p

(Temperature-Time-Transformation) curves.

3.1.2. The TTT Curves

The parameters k, p that define the kinetics of phase evolution at each temperature are extracted
from TTT (Temperature-Time-Transformation) curves. These curves are obtained experimentally
measuring the evolution of the different phases under isothermal treatment repeated at different
temperatures. Two conventional values (e.g., 5% and 95%) define the initial and final measured
fractions Xi, X f respectively. Hence, the TTT curves represent the initial and final times ti(T), t f (T) of
isothermal transformations at given temperatures as shown in the bottom right of Figure 2.

In this work, piecewise linear functions have been used to describe the TTT curves. Hence, for a
given temperature T, 2 equations can be written corresponding to the initial and final fraction of each
phase using Equation (1):

Xi = 1− e−kt
p
i (3)

X f = 1− e
−ktpf (4)

From these, the parameters k(T), p(T) of the JMAK transformations are obtained as:

p(T) =
ln C

ln(t f (T)/ti(T))
(5)

k(T) = − ln(1− X f )t f (T)−p(T) (6)

where:

C =
ln(1− X f )
ln(1− Xi)

(7)

3.1.3. Additivity Rule

The JMAK formulation was originally employed to describe isothermal transformations for heat
treatment processes. In this case, coefficients k, p characterize the kinetics of nucleation and grain
growth at a prescribed constant temperature T. However, during the fast thermal cycles typical of AM
processes, the transformations are not isothermal. For this reason, the formulation has to be adapted to
non-isothermal transformations by introducing the additivity rule [7].

According to this rule, the actual temperature evolution is replaced by the sum of consecutive
isothermal time increments. Different phase evolution kinetics are associated to each isothermal
time step using JMAK equations defined by the parameters k(T), p(T) at the respective temperature
value. Hence, the overall phase evolution is computed by summing the contribution of the fractions
calculated for each isothermal step.

The application of the additivity rule requires the computation of an equivalent time τ at the
beginning of each time increment in order to account for the change of the temperature dependent
parameters k(T), p(T). The situation is illustrated in Figure 2. At time tn, a change of temperature
occurs, from Ta to Tb. Phase evolution before tn has been evaluated with parameters k(Ta) and p(Ta);
phase evolution after tn has to be evaluated with parameters k(Tb) and p(Tb). As phase kinetics
Equation (1) is expressed in total, rather than rate, form, an equivalent time τn is defined so that:

Xn = X(τn, Tb) (8)

this being:

τn =

(
−

ln(1− Xn)
k(Tb)

)1/p(Tb)
(9)



Metals 2018, 8, 633 6 of 21

Note that τn only depends on Xn and k(Tb), p(Tb), but not on the parameters defining phase
evolution prior to tn. Using the equivalent time τn+1 = τn + ∆t, the phase fraction Xn+1 at time tn+1

is calculated as:
Xn+1 = 1− exp[−k(Tb)(τn+1)p(Tb)] (10)

Alternatively, Equation (2) in rate form can be used to evaluate the phase fraction increment as:

∆X = Ẋ(Tb)∆t (11)

and then to update Xn+1 = Xn + ∆X. This does not require the computation of the equivalent time τn

when a forward Euler integration algoritm is used.

3.1.4. Modified JMAK Model Accounting for Initial Phase Fractions and Incomplete Transformations

The original JMAK model [6] describes a complete transformation of phase 1 into phase 2.
During the transformation, fraction X1 of phase 1 decreases from 1 to 0 while fraction X2 of phase 2
evolves from 0 to 1 ( X2 = 1− X1 ). However, during the solid state transformations that take place
in AM processes of Ti6Al4V alloys, the metallurgical phenomena can be more complex than a single
complete transformation. In fact, due to the previous thermal cycles, some minor phases or structural
constituents may not participate to the main transformation, reducing the available initial fraction of
phase X1. Moreover, transformations may be incomplete. For instance, according to the phase diagram
of Ti6Al4V, the β→ α transformation is never completed because a small amount of β is left even at
room temperature.

In order to consider these phenomena, the original JMAK formulation in (1) is modified [10]:

X2(τ) = (1− e−kτ
p
)X01X

eq
2 (12)

where X01 is the initial available fraction of phase 1 at the beginning of the reaction and X
eq
2 is the

fraction of phase 2 that can form at equilibrium state at the considered temperature. The value of
initial X01 depends on the phase changes during the previous transformations, while X

eq
2 (T) can be

extracted from the equilibrium phase diagrams of the alloys.
The additivity rule presented in Equations (9) and (10) can be used with this modified JMAK

formulation as:
Xn+12 = (1− exp[−k(Tb)(τ

n+1)p(Tb)])X01X
eq
2 (Tb) (13)

with τn+1 = τn + ∆t, and τn defined as:

τn =

3.2. Microstructure Modeling of Ti6Al4V for AM Processes

The microstructural model used in this work is presented next. The model has been implemented
in COMET, a Finite Element (FE)-based framework used for the thermo-mechanical simulation of
metal deposition processes [12–14].

The following 4 main solid state transformation for Ti6Al4V alloy are considered:

(I) Formation of Widmanstätten αw: diffusion-controlled transformation (β → αw) for cooling
processes below the β-transus temperature Tβtrans.

(II) Formation of Martensite αm: diffusionless transformation (β→ αm) for fast cooling processes
below the martensite temperature Tm.

(III) Dissolution of Martensite αm: diffusion-controlled transformation (αm → αw + β) by heating
process above Tmdiss.



Metals 2018, 8, 633 7 of 21

(IV) Dissolution of total α (or re-formation of β): diffusionless transformation (α→ β) by heating
process above Tβstart.

In Figure 3 a schematic representation of the cooling/heating condition and temperature
ranges typical of these transformations is shown. The arrows represent the temperature rates
that take place during the AM processing: cooling (blue) or heating (red). The single-line arrows
correspond to diffusion-controlled transformations, the double-line arrows correspond to diffusionless
transformations. Note that the dissolution of martensite αm happens during heating but it may take
place also during isothermal treatments and even during very slow cooling at temperature above Tmdiss.

Figure 3: Schematic representation of the 4 main solid state transformation considered in the
proposed model.

�X3 = �X3

�X2 +�X3
(16)

For example, this strategy allows the model to consider the simultaneous transformation of � into
�w and �m which can occur for intermediate cooling rates [21].

3.2.1 Formation of Alpha Widmanstätten

The formation of �w is calculated for each time step using the modi�ed JMAK formulation in Eq.
(12) and following the additivity rule. The fraction �n+1w at the equivalent time �

n+1 = �n+�t at
temperature T (and then its increment ��w = �

n+1
w � �nw) is calculated as in Eq. (13):

�n+1w = (1� exp[�k(�
n+1)p])�0�eq (17)

where k(T ), p(T ) are the JMAK parameter of �w formation at the temperature T of the isothermal
time step, �0 is the available fraction of beta phase at the beginning of the reaction and �eq is the
�w fraction that can form according to the phase diagram of the alloy at temperature T . �

n is the
equivalent time that is needed to reach the amount of phase �nw at the end of the previous time
step according to the evolution law of the actual isothermal step. As for Eq.(14), �n is de�ned as:

�n =

�
1

k
ln

�0�eq

�0�eq � �nw

�1=p
(18)

Note that the available fraction of beta phase �0 at the beginning of the reaction depends on
the previous thermal history of the process. If the alloy has su¤ered fast cooling, the available �0

proposed model.

The required input of the model is the temperature evolution of the alloy. If the thermal history
of an entire domain is available, the microstructure modeling is performed locally at each material
point. The temperature evolution is split into a sequence of time steps ∆t. Both temperature and
cooling/heating rate are evaluated according to the algoritm proposed in Figure 4 in order to establish
which transformations will take place.

For each time step, the algorithm manages the sequential computation of different transformations
taking place simultaneously. The increments of fractions ∆Xi (∆Xi, i = 1, ..., N) are computed for each
transformation as ∆Xi = X

n+1
i − X

n
i . (or alternatively using Equation (11). These increments are used

to update the phase fractions at the end of the overall algorithm only, making possible to consider
contemporary transformations.

As each transformation is considered separately, contemporary transformations with the same
starting phase (e.g., X1) and different forming phases (e.g., X2, X3) can potentially lead to an
excessive consumption of the starting phase. To avoid this, the available amount of starting phase is
proportionally shared between the two transformations by rescaling the incremental phase changes as:

∆X2 = ∆X2
∆X2

∆X2 + ∆X3
(15)

∆X3 = ∆X3
∆X3

∆X2 + ∆X3
(16)

For example, this strategy allows the model to consider the simultaneous transformation of β into
αw and αm which can occur for intermediate cooling rates [24].

is reduced by the presence of �m. Due to mass conservation (�w +�m+ � = 1), for each time step
�0 can be written as: �0 = �n + �nw, where �

n; �nw are the fractions at the previous time step.
Note that �m is not involved in this transformation.

3.2.2 Formation of Alpha Martensite

In case of fast cooling rates and temperatures below the martensite start temperature Tm, the
residual � phase still available can transform into martensite or massive �m. Due to its fast
formation, �m is a non-equilibrium phase and its evolution can not be modeled as a slow di¤usional
transformation as for �w. The empirical Koistinen-Marburger equation [5], initially developed for
modeling martensite formation in steel, has been successfully used also for similar transformations
in other alloys.

The Koistinen-Marburger equation is modi�ed by means of a factor �0m that represents the
available fraction of beta phase at the beginning of the martensitic reaction. �0m strongly depends
on the previous thermal history and, in particular, on the residual � left after the �w transformation.

A modi�cation to the original formulation is proposed in this work in order to adapt the model
to the successive thermal cycles typical of AM processes. The residual �m from previous cycles is
considered as an inert phase fraction that does not participate to the transformation. Hence, when
temperature drops below Tm during a new cooling phase, a new fraction �̂m is initialized and a

3.2.1. Formation of Alpha Widmanstätten

The formation of αw is calculated for each time step using the modified JMAK formulation in
Equation (12) and following the additivity rule. The fraction αn+1w at the equivalent time τ

n+1 = τn +∆t
at temperature T (and then its increment ∆αw = α

n+1
w − αnw) is calculated as in Equation (13):

αn+1w = (1− exp[−k(τ
n+1)p])β0αeq (17)

where k(T), p(T) are the JMAK parameter of αw formation at the temperature T of the isothermal time
step, β0 is the available fraction of beta phase at the beginning of the reaction and αeq is the αw fraction
that can form according to the phase diagram of the alloy at temperature T. τn is the equivalent time
that is needed to reach the amount of phase αnw at the end of the previous time step according to the
evolution law of the actual isothermal step. As for Equation (14), τn is defined as:

τn =

(
1
k

ln
β0αeq

β0αeq − αnw

)1/p
(18)

Note that the available fraction of beta phase β0 at the beginning of the reaction depends on
the previous thermal history of the process. If the alloy has suffered fast cooling, the available β0 is
reduced by the presence of αm. Due to mass conservation (αw + αm + β = 1), for each time step β

0 can
be written as: β0 = βn + αnw, where β

n, αnw are the fractions at the previous time step. Note that αm is
not involved in this transformation.

3.2.2. Formation of Alpha Martensite

In case of fast cooling rates and temperatures below the martensite start temperature Tm,
the residual β phase still available can transform into martensite or massive αm. Due to its fast
formation, αm is a non-equilibrium phase and its evolution can not be modeled as a slow diffusional
transformation as for αw. The empirical Koistinen-Marburger equation [8], initially developed for



Metals 2018, 8, 633 9 of 21

modeling martensite formation in steel, has been successfully used also for similar transformations in
other alloys.

The Koistinen-Marburger equation is modified by means of a factor β0m that represents the
available fraction of beta phase at the beginning of the martensitic reaction. β0m strongly depends on
the previous thermal history and, in particular, on the residual β left after the αw transformation.

A modification to the original formulation is proposed in this work in order to adapt the
model to the successive thermal cycles typical of AM processes. The residual αm from previous
cycles is considered as an inert phase fraction that does not participate to the transformation.
Hence, when temperature drops below Tm during a new cooling phase, a new fraction α̂m is
initialized and a new martensite formation starts. The fraction α̂n+1m (and then the martensite increment
∆αm = ∆α̂m = α̂n+1m − α̂nm) is computed as:

α̂n+1m = (1− exp[−km(Tm − T)])β
0
m (19)

where km is the empirical Koistinen-Marburger constant. The available β
0
m at the start of martensite

formation is not only reduced by the previous αw transformation, but also by the residual αm still
present from previous cooling cycles. Hence, β0m can be written at each time step as β

0
m = β

n + α̂nm.
For cooling rates slower than 410 ◦C/s the total transformation of β to αm is not allowed [24].

In fact, in this case, a minimum fraction of β = βeq = 1− αeq has to remain at low temperatures
according to the phase diagram. This fraction βeq has to be subtracted from the available β phase
(β0m = β

n + α̂nm − β
eq).

3.2.3. Dissolution of Alpha Martensite

Martensite is a non-equilibrium structure obtained during fast cooling. At room temperature αm
is stable. Re-heating and/or isothermal treatments, even at relatively low temperatures (Martensite
dissolution start temperature Tmdis around 350–400

◦C [20]), cause a re-transformation of αm into more
stable α +β structures [11]. This new structure presents a different morphology from αw. As in [10],
this difference is ignored and αm is considered to transform into αw + β.

The dissolution of Martensite αm is a slow diffusion-controlled transformation. In this work it is
modeled by means of the additivity rule with modified JMAK equations through an approach similar
to the one used for the αw formation.

The TTT diagrams can be indirectly obtained by measuring the hardness of Ti6Al4V samples
under isothermal heat treatments [20]. In order to use the modified JMAK equations, a temperature
dependent function of maximum dissolvable martensite at equilibrium α

eq
mdis(T) is defined from

the experimental data. Increasing the temperature, α
eq
mdis varies from 0 (no martensite dissolution

allowed below Tmdis around 350–400
◦C) to 1 (total martensite dissolution above Tβstart, around

650 ◦C). A normalized fraction of dissolved martensite αmdis must be defined. The fraction α
n+1
mdis at the

equivalent time τn+1 = τn + ∆t at temperature T is computed as:

αn+1mdis = 1− exp(−kdis(τ
n+1)pdis) (20)

where :

τn =

(
1

kdis
ln(1− αnmdis)

)1/pdis
(21)

The JMAK parameters kdis(T), pdis(T) that define the transformation of αmdis are calculated
using TTT curves obtained from the available experimental data of martensite dissolution.
These experimental data have to be normalized dividing the data of dissolved αm by the α

eq
mdis(T).

This allows to use the obtained kdis and pdis parameters in JMAK equations that represent a fully
complete evolution of αmdis from 0 (no dissolution) to 1 (complete dissolution αmdis = α

eq
mdis).



Metals 2018, 8, 633 10 of 21

Note that, for the calculation of the new increment in Equation (20), the value of the αnmdis has

to be corrected in order to be consistent with the actual value of α
eq_n+1
mdis (αmdis = αmdis α

eq_n
mdis/α

eq_n+1
mdis ).

Thus, the ∆αm martensite increment relative to this transformation is computed as:

∆αm = −∆αmdisα0mα

where ∆αmdis = α
n+1
mdis − α

n

m represents the initial martensite fraction available to be dissolved

and α

mdis allows for considering incomplete dissolution. The increment of dissolved martensite is

transformed into both αw and β phases, according to their equilibrium proportion at the current
temperature (αeq and βeq = 1− αeq, respectively):

∆αw = α
eq∆αm (23)

∆β = (1− αeq)∆αm (24)

3.2.4. Alpha to Beta Transformation

During re-heating, a transformation of α → β can take place at a similar temperature range of
the inverse β→ αw transformation. Note that α represents the total alpha phase (α = αw + αm). In the
model, this transformation is assumed to start at the temperature Tβstart at which β

eq(T) = 1− αeq(T)
begins to grow according to the phase diagram of the alloy.

Kelly’s empirical model [9] has been employed to deal with such transformation. The model
depends on a temperature dependent function Fdis(T). Hence, β

n+1 fraction at the equivalent time
τn+1 = τn + ∆t at temperature T is computed as:

βn+1 = Fdis(1− αeq)(τn+1)0.5 (25)

where τn is the relative time needed to to reach the phase fraction βn with the new evolution law
dependent from Fdis(T) :

τn =

(
βn

Fdis(1− αeq)

)2
(26)

As α = αw + αm, the decrement ∆α = −∆β = −(βn+1 − βn) is divided into two contributes:
∆αw and ∆αm, weighted according to the αw and αm previous proportion:

∆αw = −∆β

4. Numerical Results and Sensitivity Analysis to Material Data

4.1. Cooling Process

The behavior of the microstructural model described in Section 3 has been tested in simple cases
of continuous cooling at constant rates between 10 and 50 K/min. When temperature drops below
Tβtrans = 998 ◦C the formation of the Widmanstätten αw fraction is calculated according to Equation (17).
The evolution of αw for continuous cooling obtained by Charles et al. [10] have been considered as
a reference for the calibration procedure. The same input data used in [10] have been adopted to
evaluate the response of the two models. The temperature dependent function αeq(T) used is reported
in Table 1 [25]. The TTT curves used are reported in Figure 5 in dashed lines.

Figure 5: TTT-diagrams for Ti6Al4V: proposed from Charles et al. in [7] (dashed line) and a mix
of Malinov�s [24],[25] and Kelly�s [6] data (continuous line)

according to the modi�ed Koistinen equation (19). Di¤erent values of the parameters (km,Tm) are
reported in literature ([23], [21], [22]) and several simulations have been performed varying these 2
parameters which in�uence the amplitude and the starting point of the transformation, respectively.
However, martensite content strongly depends on the amount of residual � still available at Tm
after the �w transformation. Martensite fraction evolutions calculated for cooling rates varying
between 3:5 and 48 K=s are reported in Figure 7 assuming Tm = 575�C and km = 0:005 as in [7].
Two di¤erent sets of TTT curves have been used for the �w transformation.

The results reported in dashed lines are obtained using TTT diagrams as proposed by Charles
et al. (see Fig. 5). Note that in this case only very fast cooling rates (48 K=s) allow for signi�cative
martensite formation. For slower cooling rates, this fraction is negligible (less than 5 %) in most
of the cases. Optical micrographies of Ti6Al4V have been used to evaluate the accuracy of the
numerical results obtained. For similar ranges of cooling rates, some qualitative results are found
in literature ([21],[13]). The experimental results from the two di¤erent references present some
variability due to the di¤erent process conditions. However, these experimental results, reported
in Table 2, have been used for a �rst validation of the numerical model.

The numerical results obtained using the TTT diagrams from Charles et al. show a poor
correlation for cooling rates between 9 and 18K=s. This discordance may be due to a fast formation
of �w, that does not let enough residual � for the martensitic transformation.

For this reason, another set of TTT data available in literature has been tested (continuous
lines in Fig. 5). Observe that there is a great di¤erence between these transformation diagrams.
There exists a large number of experimental data performed at high temperatures (750-1000�C)
as those reported by Malinov [24],[25], while is more di¢ cult to �nd a characterization of such
curves at lower temperature (e.g. TTT diagrams by Kelly [6]). Combining the TTT data from

Malinov’s [26,27] and Kelly’s [9] data (continuous line).

The numerical results are reported in Figure 6 where remarkable agreement with the reference
model is achieved. Note that the model proposed by Charles et al. takes also into account the formation
of grain boundary αgb during αw transformation and they refer to total alpha fraction as the sum of
αw and αgb. Considering that the amount of αgb phase is typically very low, the contribution of this
minor phase has been neglected in this work. Moreover, as αgb typically forms at the beginning of the
solid state transformation, the underestimation of total α fraction affects only the initial part of the
evolution curves.

Figure 6: Alpha phase evolution calculated for di¤erent cooling rates. Comparison with numerical
results from Charles et al. model [7] (same TTT material input).

Malinov and Kelly, the TTT curves shown by continuous line in Fig. 5 have been obtained. Using
this data the numerical model results in a better agreement for the entire range of cooling rates
analyzed, as shown in Figure 7 (continuous lines). The proposed set of TTT diagrams leads to a
more gradual transition between fully martensitic and fully Widmanstätten structures and a better
overall agreement with the actual microstructures.

4.2 Re-heating process and isothermal treatment

Several analyses are also performed for isothermal treatments and heating conditions.
The martensite dissolution at low temperatures has been characterized by the work of Gil Mur

[17], where the JMAK parameters k and p that drive the transformation were indirectly obtained
from measured hardness of Ti6Al4V samples. For di¤erent values of temperature, fully martensitic
samples were subjected to isothermal treatments and the resulting Hardness Vickers (HV) was
measured at di¤erent times of the treatments. For each temperature value, an evolution of HV
was found as shown in Figure 8. Note that HV is directly correlated with the martensite content.
Hence, the work of Gil Mur establishes a relationship between hardness measurement and the
dissolution of the martensite content for di¤erent isothermal treatments which can be represented
by TTT curves. From the experimental data it can be seen that, at low temperatures, only a small
fraction of the total martensite content can be dissolved, even for very long heat treatments. At
high temperatures, around 700oC the martensite dissolution is maximum.

15

Figure 6. Alpha phase evolution calculated for different cooling rates. Comparison with numerical
results from Charles et al. model [10] (same TTT material input).

The model has been tested also in case of faster cooling rates allowing for martensite (αm)
formation. The computation of martensite evolution begins when the temperature drops below
Tm according to the modified Koistinen equation (19). Different values of the parameters (km,Tm)
are reported in literature ([24,25,28]) and several simulations have been performed varying these
2 parameters which influence the amplitude and the starting point of the transformation, respectively.
However, martensite content strongly depends on the amount of residual β still available at Tm after
the αw transformation. Martensite fraction evolutions calculated for cooling rates varying between
3.5 and 48 K/s are reported in Figure 7 assuming Tm = 575 ◦C and km = 0.005 as in [10]. Two different
sets of TTT curves have been used for the αw transformation.

Figure 7: Martensite fraction evolution during continuous coolings. Comparison between results
obtained with TTT proposed by Charles et al. [7] and with TTT obtained by a mix of Malinov�s
[24],[25]and Kelly�s [6] data.

The results of martensite dissolution during isothermal treatments calculated using the tradi-
tional JMAK equations as in [17] (dotted lines) and using the model proposed in Section 3.2.3
(dashed lines) are shown in Figure 8. The TTT curves and the function �eqmdis(T ) employed in
the proposed model are reported in Table 3 and are extracted from Gil Mur�s HV data (see Fig.
8), considering martensite dissolution directly proportional to the HV. No martensite dissolution
(�eqmdis = 0) corresponds to the minimum value of 330 HV. �

eq
mdis = 1 corresponds to a total marten-

site dissolution and a maximum Hardness of 410 HV. The TTT curves are related to the evolution
of the normalized fraction �mdis (see Eq. (22)). For �mdis = 0 martensite dissolution has not
started. For �mdis = 1 martensite dissolution has reached the maximum value of �

eq
mdis(T ). The

evolution curves calculated using the proposed model show a remarkable accuracy in the prediction
of the actual martensitic dissolution, particularly at low temperatures.

The results reported in dashed lines are obtained using TTT diagrams as proposed by Charles et al.
(see Figure 5). Note that in this case only very fast cooling rates (48 K/s) allow for significative
martensite formation. For slower cooling rates, this fraction is negligible (less than 5%) in most
of the cases. Optical micrographies of Ti6Al4V have been used to evaluate the accuracy of the
numerical results obtained. For similar ranges of cooling rates, some qualitative results are found in
literature ([16,24]). The experimental results from the two different references present some variability
due to the different process conditions. However, these experimental results, reported in Table 2,
have been used for a first validation of the numerical model.

microstructures in literature and results obtained with different TTT data inputs.

48 αm αm 61% 77%

The numerical results obtained using the TTT diagrams from Charles et al. show a poor correlation
for cooling rates between 9 and 18 K/s. This discordance may be due to a fast formation of αw, that does
not let enough residual β for the martensitic transformation.

For this reason, another set of TTT data available in literature has been tested (continuous lines in
Figure 5). Observe that there is a great difference between these transformation diagrams. There exists
a large number of experimental data performed at high temperatures (750–1000 ◦C) as those reported
by Malinov [26,27], while is more difficult to find a characterization of such curves at lower temperature
(e.g., TTT diagrams by Kelly [9]). Combining the TTT data from Malinov and Kelly, the TTT curves
shown by continuous line in Figure 5 have been obtained. Using this data the numerical model results
in a better agreement for the entire range of cooling rates analyzed, as shown in Figure 7 (continuous
lines). The proposed set of TTT diagrams leads to a more gradual transition between fully martensitic
and fully Widmanstätten structures and a better overall agreement with the actual microstructures.

4.2. Re-Heating Process and Isothermal Treatment

Several analyses are also performed for isothermal treatments and heating conditions.
The martensite dissolution at low temperatures has been characterized by the work of Gil Mur [20],

where the JMAK parameters k and p that drive the transformation were indirectly obtained from
measured hardness of Ti6Al4V samples. For different values of temperature, fully martensitic samples
were subjected to isothermal treatments and the resulting Hardness Vickers (HV) was measured at
different times of the treatments. For each temperature value, an evolution of HV was found as shown
in Figure 8. Note that HV is directly correlated with the martensite content. Hence, the work of Gil Mur
establishes a relationship between hardness measurement and the dissolution of the martensite content
for different isothermal treatments which can be represented by TTT curves. From the experimental
data it can be seen that, at low temperatures, only a small fraction of the total martensite content can
be dissolved, even for very long heat treatments. At high temperatures, around 700 ◦C the martensite
dissolution is maximum.

The results of martensite dissolution during isothermal treatments calculated using the traditional
JMAK equations as in [20] (dotted lines) and using the model proposed in Section 3.2.3 (dashed lines)
are shown in Figure 8. The TTT curves and the function α

eq
mdis(T) employed in the proposed model are

reported in Table 3 and are extracted from Gil Mur’s HV data (see Figure 8), considering martensite
dissolution directly proportional to the HV. No martensite dissolution (α

eq
mdis = 0) corresponds to the

minimum value of 330 HV. α
eq
mdis = 1 corresponds to a total martensite dissolution and a maximum

Hardness of 410 HV. The TTT curves are related to the evolution of the normalized fraction αmdis



Metals 2018, 8, 633 14 of 21

(see Equation (22)). For αmdis = 0 martensite dissolution has not started. For αmdis = 1 martensite
dissolution has reached the maximum value of α

eq
mdis(T). The evolution curves calculated using the

proposed model show a remarkable accuracy in the prediction of the actual martensitic dissolution,
particularly at low temperatures.

(continuous line) and fraction evolution of dissolved martensite during isothermal treatments cal-
culated using the present model (dashed line) and using JMAK equations with parameters k, p
reported by Gil Mur.

The model has been tested also for continuous heating processes where the dissolution of total
� = �w + �m into � has been modelled according to Eq. (25). Function Fdis(T ) for Ti6Al4V has
been used as calibrated by Kelly [6]: (Fdis = 2:2 � 10�31 � T 9:89k ) where Tk is the temperature in
Kelvin. The fraction �eq is calculated as 1 � �eq and �eq is the same input as used for the �w
formation (Table 1). The evolutions of Alpha Widmanstätten, Martensite and Beta computed
for continuous heating of 0:1 and 1 K=s are reported in Figure 9, assuming an initial martensite
content of 0:5. During the medium-slow heating of 0:1 K=s, a �rst growth of �w and � due to the
martensite dissolution is clearly visible. In this case, the dissolution of �m into �w + � is almost
completed in 40 minutes in accord with the experimental data of Fig.8. For higher temperatures,
the faster transformation of total � into � begins and also �w fraction decreases. Note that the

The model has been tested also for continuous heating processes where the dissolution of total
α = αw + αm into β has been modelled according to Equation (25). Function Fdis(T) for Ti6Al4V has
been used as calibrated by Kelly [9]: (Fdis = 2.2× 10−31 · T9.89k ) where Tk is the temperature in Kelvin.
The fraction βeq is calculated as 1− αeq and αeq is the same input as used for the αw formation (Table 1).
The evolutions of Alpha Widmanstätten, Martensite and Beta computed for continuous heating of
0.1 and 1 K/s are reported in Figure 9, assuming an initial martensite content of 0.5. During the
medium-slow heating of 0.1 K/s, a first growth of αw and β due to the martensite dissolution is clearly
visible. In this case, the dissolution of αm into αw + β is almost completed in 40 min in accord with
the experimental data of Figure 8. For higher temperatures, the faster transformation of total α into
β begins and also αw fraction decreases. Note that the martensite dissolution is a slow process if
compared with the other transformations. In fact, except for a small initial growth of αw, the effects of
αm dissolution are not significative for the fastest heating rate (1 K/s). Hence, for medium-fast heating
rates the martensite dissolution is almost negligible in comparison with the transformation of total α
into β.

martensite dissolution is a slow process if compared with the other transformations. In fact, except
for a small initial growth of �w, the e¤ects of �m dissolution are not signi�cative for the fastest
heating rate (1 K=s). Hence, for medium-fast heating rates the martensite dissolution is almost
negligible in comparison with the transformation of total � into � .

Figure 9: Calculated fraction evolution of Alpha Widmanstatten, Martensite and Beta during
continuous heating (0.1 - 1 K/s).

In [8], Fachinotti et al. suggested that martensite dissolution may take place not only during
heating but even during slow cooling at temperature above Tmdiss. This may happen when the alloy
starts cooling fast at high temperature and then the cooling rate gradually slows down converging
to a temperature that allows for martensite dissolution. These cooling conditions are not unusual
in AM, because the heat is preserved due the sequence of depositions, especially when back plate
heating systems are employed. For these reasons, the model presented in this work can take into
account martensite dissolution also during slow cooling. An example of phase fraction evolutions
calculated in these conditions is presented in Figure 10. The proposed temperature evolution
(dashed line) shows a fast cooling at the beginning that allows for the formation of martensite.
Then the cooling continues at temperatures about 500oC. This slow cooling can be compared to an
isothermal treatment. As the alloy remains long time at this medium-high temperature, martensite
has time to transform into �w while cooling.

4.3 AM processes

4.3.1 Experimental validation

The microstructural model has been also tested using the thermal cycles obtained during additive
manufacturing. The laser metal deposition process presented by Babu et al. in [26] has been
considered as a reference. In his work, Babu measured the evolution of the total alpha phase
fraction using x-ray di¤raction techniques. These results and the corresponding temperature

continuous heating (0.1–1 K/s).

In [11], Fachinotti et al. suggested that martensite dissolution may take place not only during
heating but even during slow cooling at temperature above Tmdiss. This may happen when the alloy
starts cooling fast at high temperature and then the cooling rate gradually slows down converging
to a temperature that allows for martensite dissolution. These cooling conditions are not unusual in
AM, because the heat is preserved due the sequence of depositions, especially when back plate heating
systems are employed. For these reasons, the model presented in this work can take into account
martensite dissolution also during slow cooling. An example of phase fraction evolutions calculated in
these conditions is presented in Figure 10. The proposed temperature evolution (dashed line) shows a
fast cooling at the beginning that allows for the formation of martensite. Then the cooling continues at
temperatures about 500 ◦C. This slow cooling can be compared to an isothermal treatment. As the
alloy remains long time at this medium-high temperature, martensite has time to transform into αw
while cooling.

Figure 10: Calculated fraction evolution of Alpha Widmanstatten, Martensite and Beta during a
gradual slowing cooling rate

evolution during the sequential metal depositions are reported in Figure 11. The temperature
evolution has been used for the computation of the fractions evolution with the model proposed
in Section 3. The calculated evolution of total alpha fraction presented in Fig. 11 agrees with the
measured values. The evolution of the martensite fraction calculated using reported TTT data
is also shown. As expected, the �nal martensite content obtained with the slower TTT curves
from Malinov-Kelly is sensibly higher than that obtained with the TTT curves from Charles et
al.. Unfortunately, no experimental data of martensite content are available for this test case.
Nevertheless, the martensite accumulation induced by the iterative thermal cycles is clearly visible.
This phenomenon depends on the di¤erent transformation rates of martensite during cooling and
heating, respectively. In fact, as martensite formation in cooling is faster than its dissolution in
heating, an accumulation is possible during AM thermal cycles.

4.3.2 3D Simulation

Finally, an example of metallurgical prediction obtained with the proposed microstructural model
for an entire 3D geometry is considered. A thin wall of 160 x 20 x 40(h) mm produced by wire feeding
AM process of Ti6Al4V has been considered. Standard parameters of wire deposition processes
have been used as reported in Table 4. The FE discretization consists of a structural mesh of 7400
hexahedral elements and 9600 nodes. The simulation has been performed using an hatch-by-hatch
activation strategy along the x direction. The temperature evolution during the entire process has
been computed by the thermal solver for AM processes (COMET) and a temperature contour �ll
during the deposition is reported in Figure 12. The contour �ll of martensite fraction at the end of
the process is reported in Figure 13 for a longitudinal section along the middle plane of the sample.

4.3. AM Processes-Experimental Validation

The microstructural model has been also tested using the thermal cycles obtained during
additive manufacturing.

The laser metal deposition process presented by Babu et al. in [29] has been considered as
a reference. In his work, Babu measured the evolution of the total alpha phase fraction using
X-ray diffraction techniques. These results and the corresponding temperature evolution during
the sequential metal depositions are reported in Figure 11. The temperature evolution has been used
for the computation of the fractions evolution with the model proposed in Section 3. The calculated
evolution of total alpha fraction presented in Figure 11 agrees with the measured values. The evolution
of the martensite fraction calculated using reported TTT data is also shown. As expected, the final
martensite content obtained with the slower TTT curves from Malinov-Kelly is sensibly higher than
that obtained with the TTT curves from Charles et al. Unfortunately, no experimental data of martensite
content are available for this test case. Nevertheless, the martensite accumulation induced by the
iterative thermal cycles is clearly visible. This phenomenon depends on the different transformation
rates of martensite during cooling and heating, respectively. In fact, as martensite formation in cooling
is faster than its dissolution in heating, an accumulation is possible during AM thermal cycles.

Figure 11: Successive cycles of metal deposition. Evolution of temperature and of total alpha
fraction measured by Babu [26]. Evolution of total alpha and martensite fractions calculated with
the present model.

Martensite presents higher concentrations in the �rst depositions due to the higher cooling rates
caused by the cold back plate. Martensite content is also high in the last layers because the last
material deposition is not followed by further re-heating cycles to preserve heat.

5 Conclusions

Microstructural modeling is necessary to predict material properties in terms of evolution of phases.
This is one of the big challenges for the numerical simulation of additive manufacturing processes.

In this paper, a model allowing for the prediction of the microstructure phase evolution of
Ti6Al4V alloys in AM processes is presented. The model is speci�cally designed to deal with
AM processes where fast cooling and re-heating cycles occur because: (a) it is able to consider
incomplete transformations and varying initial content of phases and (b) it can take into account
simultaneous transformations.

The model has been implemented in an in-house FE-based framework for the thermal simula-

The experimental data from the work of Xu et al. [30] on Ti6Al4V AM samples have been
also considered in order validate the model under different manufacturing conditions. In this case,
Ti6Al4V cubes (10 mm side) were produced by SLM (selective laser melting) technology varying
different parameters that influence the final αm content. Two specimen cubes (S3 and S5) fabricated
with different energy density have been considered for the validation of the microstructural model.
The main process parameters and the microstructures observed at the center of the specimen are
reported in Table 4. The different levels of energy density have been obtained by varying the hatch
distance. Martensite usually forms during the fast SLM deposition. If the temperatures raise for

enough time during the process, αm can transform into fine lamellar αw + β. In these experiments,
the base plate was preheated at 200 ◦C in order to promote martensite dissolution. More details about
the process conditions can be found in reference [30].

S5 375 60 1029 0.18 33.74 αm and αw + β 0.57

The resulting phase fraction have been evaluated via SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and
XRD (X-ray diffraction). Microstructural examination at the center of the cubes shows an high content
of αw + β in sample S3 due to an almost complete martensite dissolution. On the contrary, the sample
S5, fabricated with lower energy density, shows a major content of αm. The microstructures have been
observed also in different parts of the cubes. Scanning electron microscopy (BSE) images of sample
S3 from [30] are reported in Figure 12, showing an ultrafine lamellar αw + β structure in the middle
region and acicular αm structures in the upper region.

Figure 12. Scanning electron microscopy (BSE) of SLM fabricated sample S3 in the middle and top
regions [30].

The temperature and the microstructure evolution during the entire fabrication of samples S3
and S4 have been computed using COMET, considering the process parameters reported in [30] (see
Table 4). The FE discretization consists of a structured mesh of 25,700 hexahedral elements and 30778
nodes. As regards the microstructural model, the same material data presented in Section 4.1 (TTT
diagrams from Malinov and Kelly in Figure 5 for αw formation and empirical parameters for αm
formation) and Section 4.2 (Kelly function Fdis(T) for α → β transformation) have been employed,
except for the martensite dissolution. A set of TTT curves for martensite dissolution has been calibrated
in order to match the final αm content of samples S3 and S4. These TTT data are reported in Table 5
and show a faster αm dissolution in SLM processes, if compared with the data from [20] which refer to
heat treatments of samples obtained by casting.

In order to reduce the computational time, the simulation has been performed using a layer by
layer metal deposition. As observed in [14], the layer by layer strategy causes the loss of detail in
the evaluation of the high temperature peaks during the layer solidification but does not influence
the average temperature evolution during the overall SLM process. As the considered solid state
transformations take place at medium-low temperatures, the layer by layer strategy does not influence



Metals 2018, 8, 633 18 of 21

the results of final phase content. In fact, during the process simulation, αm forms during the cooling
of each layer and then starts to dissolve due to heat accumulation in the part.

In Figure 13 the calculated final αm fractions along a vertical line at the center of the cubes are
reported. High martensite fractions are obtained at the top of the cubes. This region corresponds
to the last deposited layers, where martensite had less time to dissolve due to the lack of successive
depositions. These results are totally in line with the microstructure observed by scanning electron
microscopy of sample S3 (see Figure 12).

The contour fill of the calculated αm fraction at the end of the process is reported in Figure 14 for a
vertical section xz along the middle plane of the samples (z is the building direction). In the sample
S3 fabricated with high energy density, a low martensite content is obtained (Figure 14a). The high
temperatures reached during the process allow for an almost complete martensite dissolution at the
center of the sample (αm = 0.13). In the sample S5 fabricated with lower energy density, a higher
content of martensite is obtained (Figure 14b). The lower temperatures obtained during the process
do not allow for a total martensite dissolution, leading to a mixed microstructure at the center of the
cube (αm = 0.57). The calculated αm fractions at the center of the cubes are in line with the qualitative
microstructural evaluation performed via X-ray diffraction and reported in Table 4. These results show
the adeguate response of the model to the change of process parameters.

5. Conclusions

Microstructural modeling is necessary to predict material properties in terms of evolution
of phases. This is one of the big challenges for the numerical simulation of additive
manufacturing processes.

In this paper, a model allowing for the prediction of the microstructure phase evolution of
Ti6Al4V alloys in AM processes is presented. The model is specifically designed to deal with AM
processes where fast cooling and re-heating cycles occur because: (a) it is able to consider incomplete
transformations and varying initial content of phases and (b) it can take into account simultaneous
transformations.

The model has been implemented in an in-house FE-based framework for the thermal simulation
of AM processes. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to characterize the metallurgical model for different
process conditions. Slow rates of martensite dissolution during heating have been appreciated.
This behavior, combined with the high speed of martensite formation during cooling leads to
martensite accumulation during fast thermal cycles typical of AM processes. Contrarily, depending
on the process parameters (i.e., scanning strategy, heat transfer coefficients etc.), high temperature
field can develop at some area of the deposited part. These high temperatures allow for complete
martensite dissolution, avoiding the need of post-heat treatments. Hence, the thermal and metallurgical
simulation of AM can be used to optimize the process parameters and the scanning strategy.

Finally, microstructural measurements from literature of Ti6Al4V samples fabricated by AM
process with different manufacturing conditions have been used to validate the model. The model can
be enhanced by considering not only phase evolution but also other microstructural features, such as
the αw lath thickness and also size and orientation of β grains obtained during solidification.
