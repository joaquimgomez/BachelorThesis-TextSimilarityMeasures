Abstract 

Solar selective coatings can be multi-layered materials that optimize the solar absorption while 

reducing thermal radiation losses, granting the material long-term stability. These layers are 

deposited on structural materials (e.g., stainless steel, Inconel) in order to enhance the optical and 

thermal properties of the heat transfer system. However, interesting questions regarding their 

mechanical stability arise when operating at high temperatures. In this work, a full thermo-

mechanical multiscale methodology is presented, covering the nano-, micro-, and macroscopic 

scales. In such methodology, fundamental material properties are determined by means of 

molecular dynamics simulations that are consequently implemented at the microstructural level 

by means of finite element analyses. On the other hand, the macroscale problem is solved while 

taking into account the effect of the microstructure via thermo-mechanical homogenization on a 

representative volume element (RVE). The methodology presented herein has been successfully 

implemented in a reference problem in concentrating solar power plants, namely the 

characterization of a carbon-based nanocomposite and the obtained results are in agreement with 

the expected theoretical values, demonstrating that it is now possible to apply successfully the 

concepts behind Integrated Computational Materials Engineering to design new coatings for 

complex realistic thermo-mechanical applications.

1. Introduction 
One of the most difficult challenges in Solar Thermal Electricity (STE) power plants is the 

increase in the operating temperature beyond current limits in order to boost the efficiency of the 

cycle in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. 

There are two major CSP plant configurations, namely central receiver systems (CRS) and 

parabolic trough (Figure 1a and b, respectively). A key component in both configurations is the 

receiver tube, through which solar heat radiation is transferred to the so-called heat transfer fluid 

(HTF), increasing its temperature before feeding the power block [1]. In the former configuration, 

tubes are arranged within an exposed cavity; while in the latter, the absorber tube is located at the 

focal point of the collector, usually inside the vacuum chamber conformed by another external 

glass tube. The thermal performance of this component strongly depends on the optical and 

thermo-mechanical properties of the tube materials. 

 

Figure 1. Solar selective coatings are present in two main concentrating solar power (CSP) plant 
configurations: a) central receiver systems and b) parabolic trough absorber tubes. 

The final goal of the receiver tube is therefore to heat the HTF that will eventually run (directly 

or by means of steam via an intermediate heat exchanger) the turbine. Thus, the purpose of the 

tube is to absorb as much solar radiation as possible, conduct it, and finally heat the HTF by forced 

convection [2]. 

Solar selective coatings (SSCs) [3, 4] are multi-layered materials that optimize the solar 

absorption while reducing the thermal radiation losses, granting the long-term structural stability. 

A variety of thin film architectures can be exploited as SSCs for obtaining spectral selectivity. 

One of the most efficient configurations is based on a multi-layer stack, whose composing layers 

are usually arranged as depicted in Figure 2, and described in the following [5]:

a) an antireflective (AR) layer (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2), transparent to solar radiation to increase 

solar absorption and chemically stable in air at high temperature so as to reduce corrosion; 

b) an absorber layer (e.g., transition-metal nanocomposites, cermets), which must offer 

optimal optical properties regarding absorption and conductivity as well as thermo-

mechanical stability; 

c) an infrared reflective (IR) layer (e.g., metal nitrides) beneath the absorber, with high 

reflectivity in the infrared region to reduce emissivity; and, finally, 

d) a substrate (e.g., stainless steel or Ni-based alloys) layer, that hosts the HTF and provides 

mechanical resistance. 

The composing materials of each of these layers are typically chosen (or designed) according 

to their particular optical properties (Figure 3); therefore, major efforts by materials scientists in 

Abengoa Research have been devoted in the last years to the optical enhancement of SSCs [5]. 

However, important questions regarding their thermo-mechanical stability have to be considered.

In this work, a bottom-up multiscale methodology (Figure 4), developed within the Abengoa’s 

Virtual Materials Design (VMD) project [6], is reported in order to establish a virtual laboratory 

for testing new structured materials (e.g., SSCs) for renewable energy solutions. In this virtual 

laboratory, SSCs macroscopic properties required by the continuum models (usually modeled and 

solved by means of finite element analyses, FEA) are obtained from nanoscale molecular 

dynamics (MD) simulations in a succession of progressively higher scales with their 

corresponding interfaces. In this particular work, and in order to show the capabilities of this new 

tool, a new nanoabsorber layer composed by an amorphous carbon (a-C) matrix reinforced with 

titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticles is analyzed. In this sense, original MD results are presented 

herein, especially for the case of a-C for which a large dispersion in the thermal and mechanical 

properties is found in the literature [7, 8, 9]. 

Multiscale analysis has been presented as a powerful tool in order to analyze complex 

heterogeneous media such as composite materials [10, 11]. Moreover, it has been applied in two-

level continuum thermo-mechanical problems [12, 13] or, more recently, covering even three 

continuum scales  [14, 15]. With regard to applications, multiscale thermo-mechanical schemes 

have been successfully used in RVE-based problems (i.e., micro to macro transition) like, for 

instance, in metal matrix composites [16, 17]. In this work, a novel thermo-mechanical 

homogenization scheme is presented, providing insights into the main features of the numerical 

simulation strategies, especially those regarding the implementation scheme.

Finally, the thermo-mechanical behavior of the different layers in a piece of the receiver tube 

is analyzed at the macroscale, providing useful information for the design of this type of 

components while validating the presented multiscale methodology and demonstrating that it is 

possible to conduct multiscale analyses, from atoms to structures, in a three-scale scheme. 

However, it must be remarked that, in the presence of other conditions such as finite strains, strain-

rate dependence, or damage localization, other alternative schemes [15, 18] are more adequate. 

2. The Virtual Materials Design platform 
The Virtual Materials Design (VMD) project was firstly included in Abengoa Research’s 

Strategic Research Agenda in 2012 [6, 19] with the main purpose of contributing to the 

development of a multipurpose simulation platform able to model and simulate the behavior of 

complex materials, obtaining the material properties from the most fundamental ones. The long-

term goal of the project was to cover a wide range of scales, from the atomistic to the macroscopic 

scales in fields like structural mechanics, thermal problems, optoelectronics, and electrical 

applications, with the final aim of helping in the design of new materials. To summarize, the 

specific objectives of the VMD project were: 

1. To analyze the state of the art of VMD methodology, identifying the main tools and 

platforms currently available; with their potential limitations, accessibility, cost, and 

possibilities of interfacing with other tools. 

2. To select one of those platforms or define a new one with corresponding architecture, 

modules, interfaces, and future user interface. 

3. To develop an initial module for interfacing with molecular dynamics software available, 

able to analyze the thermo-mechanical properties of a new material with respect to others 

under different conditions. 

4. To develop an initial module for interfacing with finite element continuum mechanics 

software available, able to analyze the effect on the macroscopic mechanical properties 

of the volume ratio of the components and their distribution into the microstructure. 

5. Application of these two modules to some reference problems for assessing their 

capabilities. 

As mentioned above, the main goal of this project was to provide a computational framework 

in order to create and study new innovative materials with targeted properties, optimizing the 

design process. This enlightening approach would allow the design of special-purpose materials, 

tailoring their macroscopic properties from their particular composition and microstructure while, 

at the same time, reducing the number of characterization tests and expensive prototypes. 

Likewise, along this complex process, completely novel materials may be found.

So far, great efforts have been devoted to numerical methods for the analyses of the different 

scales: nano, micro, meso, and macro [20, 12, 21, 22, 14]. However, coupling these scales still 

faces many difficulties, especially regarding the optimal procedure to share material properties 

between scales and in terms of the computational cost of performing a fully coupled multiscale 

analysis. In this sense, the challenge ahead is not only to couple a few scales, but to couple all of 

them to solve real engineering problems. It is within this context that the VMD project followed 

an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) approach [20, 23], which aim was 

to pass from the traditional “handbook approach” philosophy to a holistic one in materials design, 

relying on current computational capabilities. 

3. Molecular Dynamics characterization of absorber layers 
The results at the lowest scale obtained in this work are achieved using molecular dynamics (MD) 

simulations, using the GiD-Lammps code, which is a graphic user interface (GUI) connected to 

Lammps [24] and developed by CIMNE within the VMD project [6, 25]. 

The accuracy of atomistic MD simulations directly depends on the use of appropriate 

interatomic energies and forces. These interactions are generally described by means of analytical 

potential energy expressions. In this work, the implemented potential models are especially suited 

for reactive covalent systems that include covalent bond breaking and forming, although other 

potentials are available in GiD-Lammps [25]. 

3.1. Interaction potentials for transition metal nanocomposites 
The first interaction potential used in this work is the so-called reactive empirical bond-order, 

REBO, which is able to model chemical reactions especially those including carbon structures 

[26]. This potential has reactive capabilities and only describes short-ranged C-C interactions 

(rij<2 Å). These interactions have strong coordination-dependence through a bond order 

parameter, which adjusts the attraction between the i and j atoms, based on the position of other 

nearby atoms. 

Unfortunately, the REBO potential is not able to allow for long-range atomic interactions, 

which are of great interest in carbon systems. For this reason, a next generation REBO potential 

that overcomes this problem is used, the so-called adaptative intermolecular reactive empirical 

bond order, usually referred to as AIREBO [27]. This potential includes a series of switching 

functions representing the short-ranged Lennard-Jones repulsion and torsional potentials that are 

particularly useful for modeling amorphous carbon.  

The third interaction potential that is used in this work is the 2nd generation modified embedded 

atom method, 2NN-MEAM [28, 29], by modifying the original MEAM to partially consider 2nd

nearest-neighbor atom interactions and to remove some critical shortcomings in the former 

potential. It is thus suitable for modeling metal and alloys with fcc, bcc, hcp, and diamond cubic 

structures, as well as covalently bonded materials like silicon and carbon. The parameters used in 

this work are taken from [30, 31]. 

3.2. Mechanical properties characterization 
The interaction potentials defined above are used in order to characterize the system of study. 

Regarding the mechanical properties, we will focus on elastic constants, stress-strain curves, and 

the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The procedure to analyze these properties is described 

next. 

The elastic constants characterize the stiffness of a material. The formal definition is provided 

by the linear relation that holds between the stress and strain tensors in the limit of an infinitesimal 

deformation, thus, in tensorial notation: 

 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1) 

with 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 the second-order stress and strain tensors, respectively, and 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 the fourth-order 

constitutive tensor. Using Voigt notation and assuming material isotropy, it reduces to two 

independent constants, 𝐶𝐶11, 𝐶𝐶12, which can be computed as: 

 𝐶𝐶11 =
𝜎𝜎11
𝜀𝜀11

 (2) 

 𝐶𝐶12 =
𝜎𝜎22 + 𝜎𝜎33

2𝜀𝜀11
 (3) 

by means of a uniaxial strain test, loaded in the x direction and prescribing 𝜀𝜀22 = 𝜀𝜀33 = 0. 

In turn, under the same assumptions, such constants can be used to compute the elastic 

modulus, 𝐸𝐸, and the Poisson’s ratio, 𝑣𝑣, as: 

 𝐸𝐸 =
(𝐶𝐶11 + 2𝐶𝐶12)(𝐶𝐶11 − 𝐶𝐶12)

(𝐶𝐶11 + 𝐶𝐶12)
 (4) 

 𝑣𝑣 =
𝐶𝐶12

𝐶𝐶11 + 𝐶𝐶12
 

 
(5) 

 

The stress-strain curve describes the relationship between the stress and strain that a particular 

material displays. It is unique for each material and is found by recording the amount of 

deformation (strain) at several intervals of tensile or compressive loading (stress) or vice versa.

On the other hand, thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response 

to a change in temperature, and it is taken into account by the coefficient of thermal expansion 

(CTE), defined as the fractional change in length per degree of temperature change: 

 𝛼𝛼 =
1
𝐿𝐿

·
𝑑𝑑𝐿𝐿
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

 (6) 

where 𝐿𝐿 is a reference length . 

3.3. Thermal properties 
With regard to thermal properties, we focus on the specific heat and the thermal conductivity, 

which can be computed by MD using the interaction potentials specified in section 3.1. 

The specific heat, 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝, is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature 1 K per kilogram 

of substance. This is computed at constant pressure for a specific temperature range: 

 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (7) 
 

On the other hand, the thermal conductivity, 𝑘𝑘, is a measure of the tendency of a material to 

transfer heat energy in a diffusive manner as given by Fourier´s law. In this work, we use the 

Müller-Plathe procedure [32] that reads: 

 𝑘𝑘 =
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑⁄
 (8) 

where 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the energy flux (calculated from the cumulative ∆𝐸𝐸), and 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑⁄  the temperature 

gradient. 

4. Thermo-mechanical multiscale method 
First order thermo-mechanical homogenization consists in obtaining the material response of the 

macroscale structure from the analysis of a representative volume element (RVE) that provides 

the material thermo-mechanical performance at the microscale level. This section summarizes the 

main concepts and basic equations of a general multiscale method, while the following section 

proposes a simplified procedure to solve engineering structures with an affordable computational 

cost.  

In a multiscale procedure, the strain and thermal gradient obtained when analyzing the 

macroscopic structure are used to define the boundary conditions for the microscale problem. The 

solution of the problem at the microscale, under such conditions, acts as an equivalent constitutive 

law for the macroscale, as it provides material parameters: stiffness and conductivity, and the 

response to the conditions applied: stresses and temperature. This equivalent constitutive law is

Page 9 of 29 

used in all the Gauss points of the macroscopic model in order to obtain the global response of 

the structure. In case of having a non-linear performance of the microscopic model, a general 

approach will lead to an iterative procedure in which the RVE must be solved for different 

boundary conditions until both scales reach equilibrium, ensuring consistency between the micro- 

and macroscale solutions [33]. 

The first-order homogenization technique developed assumes a scale separation from the 

macro- to the microscale [34], that is, the characteristic length of the microscale l should be much 

smaller than the length of the macroscale elements, L: l<<L. Also, for the sake of simplicity, the 

procedure assumes small displacements and a quasi-static structural performance in both scales, 

macro and micro. 

Therefore, a general multiscale algorithm can be defined by three main stages. The first step 

is the macro to micro transition, where the macroscopic strain and temperature gradient at any 

point of the macroscopic mesh are transferred to the microscale. Afterwards, the boundary value 

problem (BVP) is solved at the microscale to obtain its mechanical and thermal response. Finally, 

the macroscale parameters are obtained through the micro-to-macro interfacing step (Figure 5). 

We use μ for the micro domain (RVE) and m for the macro domain as subscripts, for 

distinguishing the two scales. 

 
Figure 5. Thermo-mechanical multiscale method. 

4.1. Macro to micro transition 
At the macro level, the starting point for a kinematically based computational homogenization 

method is the assumption that the mechanical strain tensor, 𝜺𝜺𝑚𝑚, at each point of the macroscale 

domain, Ω𝑚𝑚 (where the position is defined through the vector 𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚), and at a certain instant 𝑡𝑡 can 

be obtained as the volume average of the microscopic mechanical strain field, 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇, defined at each 

point of the microscale domain, Ω𝜇𝜇 (where the position is defined through the vector 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇), and at 

the same time 𝑡𝑡 as: 



Montero-Chacón et al. (2016) – Multiscale thermo-mech. anal. of multi-layered coat. in ST apps. 

Page 10 of 29 

 𝜺𝜺𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (9) 

The microscopic strain field can be expressed as the symmetric gradient of the microscopic 

displacement field, 𝒖𝒖𝜇𝜇 = (𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝜇𝜇 ,𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝜇𝜇): 

 𝜺𝜺𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝛻𝛻𝑠𝑠𝒖𝒖𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (10) 

In the same way we can define the macro temperature gradient, 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝑚𝑚, at each point 𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚 and at 

each time 𝑡𝑡, as the volume average of the microscopic temperature gradient, 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝜇𝜇, defined at each 

point 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 of the microscale domain and at each time 𝑡𝑡: 

 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (11) 

Without loss of generality, we can decompose the microscale displacement and temperature 

as: 

 𝒖𝒖𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡� = 𝜺𝜺𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) ∙ �𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 − 𝒙𝒙𝑔𝑔� + 𝒖𝒖�𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡� (12) 

 𝛻𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡� = 𝛻𝛻𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) + 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝑚𝑚(𝒙𝒙𝑚𝑚, 𝑡𝑡) ∙ �𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 − 𝒙𝒙𝑔𝑔� + �̅�𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡� (13) 

where 𝒖𝒖�𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�  and �̅�𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�  are, respectively, the displacements and the temperature 

fluctuations with respect to the average fields and 𝒙𝒙𝑔𝑔 (the centroid of the microscale) at each time 

𝑡𝑡. 

Finally, we have to define the corresponding boundary conditions on the microscale. For the 

displacement and temperature fluctuation fields, we use periodic boundary conditions since they 

generally provide an intermediate and more exact response compared to other type of boundary 

conditions, as is described in [35, 36, 37, 38]: 

 𝒖𝒖�𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇+, 𝑡𝑡� = 𝒖𝒖�𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇−, 𝑡𝑡� ∀ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇+,𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇−�  ∈  𝜕𝜕Ω𝜇𝜇 (14) 

 �̅�𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇+, 𝑡𝑡� = �̅�𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇−, 𝑡𝑡� ∀ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇+,𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇−�  ∈  𝜕𝜕Ω𝜇𝜇 (15) 

being 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇+and 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇− two opposite points on the RVE boundary 𝜕𝜕Ω𝜇𝜇. 

4.2. Solution of the thermal microscale BVP 
Using the Fourier equation for heat transfer, the equilibrium of the microscale is achieved when 

the following condition is verified 



Montero-Chacón et al. (2016) – Multiscale thermo-mech. anal. of multi-layered coat. in ST apps. 

Page 11 of 29 

 𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝑚𝑚 ∙ 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 =

Ω𝜇𝜇

 (16) 

taking 𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 as a component of conductivity matrix and 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖as a component of heat flux vector. We 

can define 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 as: 

 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 = −𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖
𝜕𝜕𝛻𝛻
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝

   with (𝑝𝑝 = 𝑥𝑥,𝑦𝑦, 𝑑𝑑) (17) 

4.3. Solution of the mechanical microscale BVP 
For the mechanical problem, the Hill-Mandel principle of macro-homogeneity establishes that the 

macroscopic stress power, product of macro stress tensor, 𝜎𝜎𝑚𝑚, and the macro strain rate, 𝜀𝜀�̅�𝑚, must 

be equal to the microscopic stress power over the RVE averaged on the volume domain. Hence: 

 𝝈𝝈𝑚𝑚: 𝜺𝜺�𝑚𝑚 =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝝈𝝈𝜇𝜇: 𝜺𝜺�𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (18) 

In order to obtain the strain field for the thermo-mechanical homogenization we need to add 

the contribution from the equilibrium of the thermal RVE: 

 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇,𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼�𝛻𝛻𝜇𝜇 − 𝛻𝛻𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎� 𝐈𝐈 (19) 

where 𝛼𝛼 is the coefficient of thermal expansion, 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇,𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖  is the thermal strain contribution, 

𝛻𝛻𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎 is the environment temperature, and 𝐈𝐈 the identity tensor. Thus, the total microscale strain 

can be obtained adding the mechanical strain part, 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇,𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖: 

 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇 = 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇,𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝜺𝜺𝜇𝜇,𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 (20) 

4.4. Micro to macro transition 
Following the solution of the BVP for each case, we get the homogenized macroscopic stress 

tensor and the macroscopic heat flux vector. In addition, we can obtain the homogenized tangent 

operator and the macroscopic conductivity matrix. 

The homogenized macroscopic stress tensor can be obtained as the microscopic stress field of 

the RVE averaged on the volume as: 

 𝝈𝝈𝑚𝑚 =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝝈𝝈𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (21) 

Similarly, the homogenized macroscopic heat flux vector, 𝑞𝑞𝑚𝑚, can be evaluated in the same 

way through the microscopic heat flux vector of the RVE: 

 𝒒𝒒𝑚𝑚 =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝒒𝒒𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (22) 



Montero-Chacón et al. (2016) – Multiscale thermo-mech. anal. of multi-layered coat. in ST apps. 

Page 12 of 29 

4.5. Material homogenized properties 
The macroscopic constitutive relation defined by the homogenized properties of the RVE can be 

obtained after the solution of the microscale BVP.  

Assuming the equilibrium of the microscale expressed as: 

 � 𝝈𝝈𝜇𝜇:𝛻𝛻𝑠𝑠𝒖𝒖�𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

= 0 (23) 

for the mechanical part; and 

 � 𝒒𝒒𝜇𝜇𝛻𝛻𝛻𝛻𝜇𝜇�𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡�𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

= 0 (24) 

for the thermal one. As is described in [22] and [39], the homogenized constitutive tensor 𝑪𝑪𝐻𝐻 can 

be defined as:  

 𝑪𝑪𝐻𝐻 =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝑪𝑪𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (25) 

where 𝑪𝑪𝜇𝜇 is the material constitutive tensor of the RVE. 

The evaluation of the homogenized constitutive tensor is performed via a perturbation method. 

For each column j of the constitutive tensor, a small strain perturbation (δ𝜺𝜺�𝑖𝑖) is applied to the 

RVE in order to obtain, along with equation (23), a perturbed stress tensor (δ𝑖𝑖𝝈𝝈�). The j columns 

of the homogenized constitutive tensor can be obtained as:  

 𝑪𝑪𝑖𝑖
𝐻𝐻 ≡

δ𝑖𝑖𝝈𝝈�
δ𝜺𝜺�𝑖𝑖

 (26) 

Following an analogous procedure, the homogenized conductivity matrix can be defined as:  

 𝐾𝐾𝐻𝐻 =
1
𝑉𝑉𝜇𝜇
� 𝐾𝐾𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑉𝑉
Ω𝜇𝜇

 (27) 

where 𝐾𝐾𝜇𝜇 is the material conductivity matrix of the RVE. 

The microstructure BVP is solved imposing small temperature perturbations in each j 

direction, using equations (19) and (24). This problem provides a perturbed flux vector (δ𝑖𝑖𝒒𝒒�), that 

can be used to calculate the j column of the conductivity matrix: 

 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖
𝐻𝐻 ≡

δ𝑖𝑖𝑞𝑞�
δ�̅�𝛻𝑖𝑖

 (28) 

5. Multiscale procedure 
This work aims to demonstrate that it is possible to conduct multiscale analyses of real structures, 

obtaining the material performance from the atomic scale. 



Montero-Chacón et al. (2016) – Multiscale thermo-mech. anal. of multi-layered coat. in ST apps. 

Page 13 of 29 

Despite the recent improvements on multiscale methods, most of them are based on obtaining 

material properties from molecular dynamics, or on coupling the macroscale (or structural) model 

with a mesoscale model that can account for the interaction among components in a composite 

[10, 11, 40, 41, 42]. Coupling these two scales already represents a significant computational cost 

as shown by Otero et al. in [43]. Besides, most of these analyses are conducted in the linear range 

because a non-linear analysis of a structure using a homogenized approach increases even more 

the computational cost, unless some strategy is used in order to reduce the number of time 

intervals in which the RVE has to be analyzed, such as the one presented in [39].  

In the following, a simplified multiscale procedure to characterizing the thermo-mechanical 

response of a macro structure is proposed, moving from molecular dynamics to the macro-scale. 

The procedure provides all the advantages of multiscale analyses, in terms of material thermo-

mechanical characterization, with an affordable computational cost. This scheme assumes that 

linear behavior is usually considered during the first stages of the design process for most 

engineering structures. In this case, the iterative procedure defined in section 4 is no longer 

needed, as the material properties will remain constant during the whole analysis. Therefore, it is 

possible to design the structure (or the material) by only using a bottom-up approach. Afterwards, 

the procedure offers the possibility of analyzing certain strategic RVEs, based on the results 

obtained from the macro-structure, in order to obtain their thermo-mechanical performance under 

the applied load regime (top-down analysis). This procedure is shown schematically in Figure 6 

and is described in detail next: 

1. The thermo-mechanical properties of the base materials used in the structural component 

are obtained from MD analysis, following the procedure shown in section 3. 

2. The mesoscale of the structural material is analyzed using an RVE, in which the material 

properties of the different components are obtained from MD. The RVE is used to obtain 

the homogenized properties of the composite, as it has been shown in the previous section. 

3. The macro structure is simulated with a finite element model that uses the material 

properties obtained from the RVE. These properties are not modified during the structural 

analysis. Therefore, the simulation is conducted assuming that the material performance of 

the RVE is linear, since the material thermo-mechanical properties are not modified even 

if the stresses exceed the failure threshold value. 

4. Although the analysis conducted for the macro-structure does not take into account the non-

linear performance of the material, it is possible to study the material response once the 

macro-analysis has been completed. This is done by selecting the elements with larger 

stresses, or those placed in strategic locations, and applying the load history (e.g., strains 

and temperatures) obtained from the structural analysis onto the RVE. With these

simulations, it is possible to check whether any of these materials has failed during the 

simulation and its corresponding failure mode.

6. Multiscale thermo-mechanical analysis of absorber tubes 
The present example was selected as a proof-of-concept test case for the proposed multiscale 

solution procedure. The objective is thus to test the capability of the proposed algorithm in 

capturing the physical behavior of interest. 

Let us consider the case of an asymmetric temperature distribution in a receiver tube caused 

by the projection of the solar radiation on one half of the tube. This problem can be easily solved 

using the FEM, considering radiation and convection on the exposed half, and only convection 

on the other. This asymmetry in the temperature field will result in the deformation of the tube in 

bending. This temperature distribution can be applied to the different layers in the SSC, paying 

special attention to the absorber layer, which is critical. Figure 7 shows a scheme of this validation 

example. 

The receiver tube substrate is made of Inconel, with the following layers: a) alumina as the 

AR layer; b) an amorphous carbon (a-C) matrix with embedded titanium carbide (TiC) particles 

as the nanoabsorber; and c) titanium nitride (TiN) as the IR layer.

6.1. MD characterization of a-C/TiC nanoabsorbers 
The simulated a-C systems were prepared at 2.6 g/cm3 by quenching samples of molten carbon, 

as proposed by Stuart et al. [7], and using the three potentials described in section 3. The systems 

were heated to 5000 K with a Nosé-Hoover thermostat and equilibrated at that temperature for 

100 ps. The liquid samples were then cooled down to 300 K over 100 ps. Following this, the 

systems were equilibrated for a further 50 ps to anneal any transient structures (Figure 8). Finally, 

we calculated the temporal averages over another 50 ps. 

Figure 9 shows the radial distribution function (RDF), which describes how density varies as 

a function of distance from a reference atom. Comparing Figure 9a and b, it can be concluded that 

the agreement between the RDFs using the AIREBO and the 2NN-MEAM potentials with 

previous simulation data is quite good. Table 1 lists the mean angles for a specific hybridization 

state as well as the percentage of atoms for that state in a-C using the different models of 

interaction. A comparison of the concentration of various coordination atoms in a-C networks 

with those from [7] is also included.

We decided to continue using the 2NN-MEAM potential due its suitability for covalently 

bonded materials. Thus, in order to validate the 2NN-MEAM potential for carbon structures, we 

computed the elastic constants for a diamond structure. Table 2 shows the elastic constants of 

diamond calculated using the 2NN-MEAM potential, in comparison with other calculations and 

experiments. The elastic constants are well reproduced by this potential, being C11=447 GPa, 

C12=72 GPa, and C44=184 GPa. These results are in a good agreement with those published for a 

pure nanocomposite carbon (na-C) with similar density [8] (C11~500 GPa, C12~100 GPa, and 

C44~200 GPa). The stress-strain curve for an a-C sample suggests a ductile behavior as shown in 

Figure 10. At room temperature, the critical stress level is reached at 20 GPa.

In spite of the huge technological interest in amorphous carbon, there are few reports on its 

coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Marques et al. [9] showed that the CTE depends on the 

concentration of sp2 bonded carbon, increasing to the value of graphite as the sp2 concentration 

approaches 100%. In this work, we were able to reproduce the CTE of Wang et al. [47] for an a-

C structure where the 90% of the C bonds are sp2 (quite close to our selected system, 86.63%), 

yielding a value of 6.6 10-6 1/K in contrast to 6.8 10-6 1/K found in [47]. 

To create and characterize the TiC phase, the system is defined using an fcc structure with a 

lattice parameter of 4.42 Å. Regarding the mechanical properties, the elastic constants were 

computed using the 2NN-MEAM potential, reproducing the results by [31], as shown in Table 3. 

The stress-strain curve for the TiC structure is shown in Figure 11, showing a maximum at ~30 

GPa. 

Regarding, the CTE, a value of 4.64⋅10-6 1/K was obtained in the x direction. We also 

computed the coefficient of thermal expansion along the y and z directions of the TiC system 

resulting 4.20⋅10-6 1/K and 4.43⋅10-6 1/K, respectively. As expected, the structure has an almost 

isotropic behavior and the results are within the range provided by Engbergand and Zehms [48]. 

Moreover, in order to reproduce the conditions of reference [48], a simulation for a wider range 

of temperature (1200-2900 K) is performed, yielding a value of 8.92 ± 0.05 K-1, which is also in 

good agreement with the published one.

6.2. RVE characterization of nanoabsorbers 
At the nanoscale, or more precisely the submicroscale, the nanoabsorber is presented as a 

heterogeneous composite material, with an a-C matrix and TiC embedded particles. Both phases 

have been characterized at the lowest scale [5]. Thus, this information can be used at the next 

scale in order to characterize the behavior of the nanoabsorber as a whole. 

In order to carry out the thermo-mechanical characterization of the absorber layer, an RVE has 

to be defined. In this study, we choose a unit cell with a single inclusion and a random distribution 

of several inclusions meeting the same volume fraction (Vf=30%). Thus, the former is a cubic 

specimen of size 6 nm with a particle with diameter 5 nm; and the latter is a 200 nm cubic 

specimen with 9 inclusions of 5 nm in diameter, as depicted in Figure 12. For both configurations 

we also model the interface between matrix and inclusion with zero thickness linear elements 

using thermo-mechanical cohesive damage model [13]. The specimen size has been defined so as 

to respect the average size of the TiC particles synthesized in the laboratory and so as to comply 

with the volume fraction of these particles in the resulting composite material. In any case, as it 

is shown in reference [42], in first order multiscale procedures, the size of the RVE is not relevant, 

as long as the proportions between the different materials is fulfilled. 

On the other hand, the RVE with 9 inclusions has been defined in order to evaluate the effect 

of the interaction between the different particles in the material. Moreover, as they have a regular 

distribution, the results obtained from both models are expected to be very similar. However, in 

the case of a random distribution of the different particles in the composite, more RVE 

configurations should be considered so as to ensure the representability of the model, as it is 

shown in [49].

Table 4 shows the thermo-mechanical parameters considered for the characterization of the 

nano-absorber layer components, namely TiC and a-C. These properties are applied to the RVE 

models described previously, obtaining the composite homogenized mechanical properties shown 

in Table 5. This table shows that the results obtained with the model containing 1 sphere are, as 

expected, very similar to the results obtained with the 9 spheres model. The values obtained are 

in agreement with those provided by the rule of mixtures. This formulation provides the properties 

of the composite averaging the contribution of each component by its volumetric participation 

[21, 50]. It combines the components assuming that they have a parallel, serial, or mixed behavior 

[51, 21], and it can also account for material non-linearity [52, 53]. It must be remarked that, when 

compared with the homogenized results, the mixing theory usually provides conservative results 

[43]. 

Figure 13 presents the Cauchy stress components in the z (transversal) direction for both unit 

cells subjected to prescribed displacements. It can be seen that the minimum and maximum values 

are in good agreement in both cases.

An important issue in this type of nanoabsorber is the potential particle-matrix debonding that 

may take place with the rise of temperature. The computational methodology developed in this 

work is able to account for such phenomenon; not only allowing for the debonding itself via 

cohesive elements, but also including the potential matrix damage (Figure 14). As previously 

mentioned, we must remark that we did not compute the cohesive laws at the atomistic level. On 

the other hand, we use the model proposed by Özdemir et. al [13] for illustrative purposes. The 

material parameters used for the cohesive element are the same of the matrix reduced by 10%. It 

is also interesting to observe that the predictions of our model could be used at a later stage to 

characterize a (homogenized) critical stress, beyond which coarse scale damage will begin to 

develop. This will open the way for a completely ab-initio characterization of the material which 

is of obvious interest to industry.

One important effect of particle-matrix debonding is the global loss in the conductivity of the 

layer as a result of the temperature field redistribution, as observed in Figure 15. This effect can 

be intuitively understood as newly opened gaps that severely impact the heat conduction across 

the RVE, due to the appearance of reduced conductivity spots, resulting in an anisotropic 

reduction of the conductivity in the direction of the opening gaps. The introduction of such effects 

in a more traditional approach (typically based on closed-form constitutive laws) would be 

extremely complex since it would require the characterization of a sharp change in the 

characteristics of the material which is moreover strongly anisotropic in nature.

6.3. Macroscopic response 
As it is described in Section 5, the macroscopic analysis of the receiver tube is conducted within 

the linear regime, using the material properties obtained from the RVE simulations. Therefore, 

the material values obtained above, along with the material information corresponding to the other 

layers of the tube, it is possible to analyze the macroscale structure (i.e. a piece of the receiver 

tube) subjected to a given radial thermal gradient as depicted in Figure 16a, that results in the 

consequent skew deformation shown in Figure 16b. 

Considering the thickness of SSCs negligible with respect to that of the substrate, we can 

assume the same strain field for the different layers that compose the tube. In that way, using the 

material properties in Table 6 and simulating the layers as 2D membranes covering the 3D 

substrate, it is possible to determine the stress distribution in any single layer (Figure 17) and 

foresee potential critical zones.

6.4. Material top-down analysis 
Although the structural simulation of the receiver tube does not reach the non-linear regime, it 

does provide the critical zones in which the maximum stress and/or temperature values are found. 

The results of the Gauss points in these regions can be downscaled, applying the corresponding 

strain and thermal fields to the RVE in order to determine the microscopic stress distribution and 

predict potential failure (e.g., cracking, debonding). This feature is already implemented in an in-

house tool for designing micro-materials (GiD-VMD), developed by CIMNE in collaboration 

with Abengoa Research [25, 55]. 

For our current analysis, the material response provided by the RVE at some Gauss points is 

shown in Figure 18. As can be seen in this figure, the RVE has a linear response for all the Gauss 

points and, therefore, the non-linear response that can be predicted by the RVE, as shown in 

section 6.2, does not take place.

7. Conclusions 
In the present work, the authors present a multiscale and multiphysical methodology for the 

analysis of receiver tubes with multi-layered coatings, especially recommended in concentrating 

solar power plants. On one hand, three different scales are covered, going from the atomistic (with 

the use of MD) to the structural analysis, through an intermediate microscopic analysis of absorber 

layers, via FEM simulations. On the other hand, the methodology includes the possibility to 

account for thermo-mechanical simulations, of main importance in this type of plants. This 

multiscale approach is valid for the whole elastic regime; however, in the presence of damage 

localization, it must be carefully revisited. The scales are connected in a hierarchical fashion, 

being able to cross from the lowest level towards the highest, and the other way around. 

Regarding the atomistic simulations, an MD methodology has been successfully applied in 

order to analyze the material properties of single phases present in nanoabsorbers. In this sense, 

original results for amorphous carbon, especially for the elastic constants and the CTE, have been 

derived. 

At the microscale, an RVE-based thermo-mechanical homogenization scheme has been 

presented. It takes into account both the mechanical and the heat transfer problem, being able to 

provide homogenized mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposite. Moreover, it has 

been validated with experimental results and it has been finally applied to a relevant problem in 

CSP plants. 

Finally, a full multiscale problem, covering the aforementioned scales, has been presented, 

allowing the identification of critical zones in specific layers of solar selective coatings. The 

material properties are obtained from fundamental levels, and sequentially upscaled into higher-

level analyses. The definition of the interaction potentials, which is essential in the success of this 

methodology, is not straightforward as it requires the expertise of the computational material 

scientists and is time-consuming. However, provided the number of material configurations will 

exponentially increase in the coming years, the interatomic potential database will progressively 

be more complete and, thus, actual in silico design of materials will become possible. Of course, 

as the scale resolution increases, the computational demand also increases. For this reason, efforts 

should be directed towards numerical methods that will enable complex non-linear multiphysical 

analysis of these materials.
