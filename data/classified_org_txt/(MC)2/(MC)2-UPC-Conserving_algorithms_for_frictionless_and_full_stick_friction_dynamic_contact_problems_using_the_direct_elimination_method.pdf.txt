Summary 
 
In this paper, conserving time-stepping algorithms for frictionless and full stick friction dynamic 
contact problems are presented. Time integration algorithms for frictionless and full stick 
friction dynamic contact problems have been designed in order to preserve the conservation of 
key discrete properties satisfied at the continuum level. Energy and energy-momentum 
preserving algorithms for frictionless and full stick friction dynamic contact problems, 
respectively, have been designed and implemented within the framework of the direct 
elimination method, avoiding the drawbacks linked to the use of penalty-based or Lagrange 
multipliers methods. An assessment of the performance of the resulting formulation is shown in 
a number of selected and representative numerical examples, under full stick friction and slip 
frictionless contact conditions. Conservation of key discrete properties exhibited by the time 
stepping algorithm is shown. 
 
Keywords: contact mechanics, full stick friction, frictionless, finite elements, dynamics, 
conserving algorithms, direct elimination method 
 

1 Introduction, motivation and goals 

Numerical analysis of contact problems has been one of the hot research topics of interest over 
the last decades. Contact problems arise in many applications, such as in crashworthiness, 
projectile impact, and material forming processes, i.e. sheet metal forming, bulk forming, 
casting, friction stir welding, cutting, powder compaction, and additive manufacturing. Despite 
the important progresses achieved in computational contact mechanics, the numerical 
simulation of contact problems is still nowadays a complex task, mainly due to the highly 
nonlinear nature of the problem, potentially involving fully nonlinear kinematics, finite strains,

large slips, nonlinear boundary conditions, complex frictional behavior phenomena, 
thermomechanical contact, etc. 

Mathematically, the numerical analysis of a contact problem amounts to finding the 
solution of an Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) within a constrained solution space. The 
variational formulation of a contact problem includes restrictions on the admissible variations in 
the tangent solution space induced by the contact constraints, yielding to Variational 
Inequalities (VI). See, for instance, Kikuchi & Oden (1988) [22] and Duvaut & Lions (1972) 
[10]. The solution of contact problems has been typically tackled using two approaches: 
Lagrange multipliers and penalty-based methods. A good overview of those approaches can be 
found in the classical books written by Laursen (2002) [26] and Wriggers (2006) [40]. An 
alternative approach to solve contact problems, the direct elimination algorithm (DEA), is 
briefly addressed by Wriggers [40]. 

Within the Lagrange multipliers method the kinematical contact constraints are exactly 
satisfied. On the other hand, Lagrange multiplier methods are cumbersome to implement and 
the total number of equations increases and changes during the solution process. Within the 
penalty-based methods, a regularization of the contact constraints, using penalty or augmented 
Lagrangian approaches, allows us to bypass the need to find a solution within a constrained 
solution space and provides a very convenient displacement driven contact formulation. Well 
known drwabacks linked to the penalty method are the penalty sensitivity and possible ill-
conditioning of the system of equations. To avoid those main drawbacks exhibited by the 
penalty method, while retaining his advantages, the augmented Lagrangian method, using 
Uzawa’s algorithm, has been used as an alternative regularization procedure [26],[40]. The 
DEA for quasi-static and dynamic frictionless and full stick friction contact problems has been 
addressed by Di Capua & Agelet de Saracibar (2015) [9]. Using the DEA, Lagrange multipliers 
and penalty-based regularized formulations of the contact problem, such as penalty or 
Augmented Lagrangian methods, are fully avoided and the contact constraints are directly 
imposed yielding a modified set of residual equations. 

At the contact discrete level, two classical approaches, node-to-segment (NTS) and 
segment-to-segment (STS) are widely used. NTS is one of the most popular approaches to 
tackle contact problems, particularly within the framework of large deformations. This 
popularity mainly comes due to the simplicity of its implementation, compared to other 
methods. Key references on NTS contact methods, addressing penalty, Lagrange multipliers, 
and augmented Lagrangian methods, are the now classical books written by Laursen (2002) [26] 
and Wriggers (2006) [40]. Its popularity has been maintained despite the fact that, as it is well 
know now, NTS methods do not pass the patch test and exhibits poor convergence properties 
[28]. In particular, local errors at the contact surface do not necessarily diminish when the mesh 
is refined [11]. To avoid those drawbacks inherent to NTS methods, a new family of STS 
contact methods, called mortar methods, was developed and it is now well established for 
contact problems. For applications of the mortar method to two-dimensional contact problems, 
see McDevitt & Laursen (2000) [27], Yang [41], Flemish et al. (2005) [13], and Fischer & 
Wriggers (2005) [12]. A STS mortar contact method for quadratic elements is proposed by Puso 
et al. (2008) [32]. Three-dimensional applications of the mortar method can be find in Puso & 
Laursen [30],[31]. Dual active set strategies based on the mortar method have been presented by

Wohlmuth (2000) [39], Hüeber & Wohlmuth (2005) [21], Brunssen et al. (2007) [8], and Popp 
et al. (2010) [29].  

Energy-momentum algorithms for non-linear elastodynamics problems have been first 
developed by Simo & Tarnow [34] and Simo et al. [35]. Further improvements for general 
models in nonlinear elasticity were developep by Gonzalez [14]. First applications of the 
energy-momentum scheme to unilateral contact constraints within the framework of the NTS 
methods can be found in Laursen & Chawla (1997) [24] and in Armero & Petocz (1998, 1999) 
[3],[4]. Further developments, also within the NTS framework, can be found in Laursen & Love 
(2002) [25], Hauret & Le Tallec (2006) [16], Haikal & Hjelmstad (2007) [15], Betsch & Hesch 
(2007) [7], and Hesch & Betsch (2011) [18]. Applications of the energy-momentum scheme 
using the mortar method can be found in Hesch & Betsch (2010) [19] for transient 3d domain 
decomposition problems, in Hesch & Betsch (2009) [20] for two-dimensional contact problems, 
and in Hesch & Betsch (2011) [17] for three-dimensional contact problems. 

This work is a follow-up of the one published by Di Capua & Agelet de Saracibar 
(2015) [9] where the main aspects of the DEA for quasi-static and dynamic contact problems 
were introduced. Here now the focus is placed on the development, implementation and 
validation of energy-momentum conserving schemes formulated within the framework of the 
direct elimination method. In particular conserving algorithms are presented for the two cases of 
interest in dynamic contact problems: a energy conserving scheme for the full stick frictional 
case, and an energy-momentum conserving scheme for the slip frictionless case. Finite 
deformation kinematics is considered. On the other hand, a more convenient and natural 
formulation of the direct elimination method for the slip frictionless case is derived. This 
formulation is given now in terms of the contravariant components of the iso-parametric 
coordinates of the incremental slip of the closest-point-projection on the covariant basis vectors 
evaluated at the mid-point configuration. 

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the main aspects of the contact 
problem at a continuum setting are briefly presented. Section 3 deals with the finite element 
formulation of the contactless problem. Section 4 deals with the main aspects of the finite 
element formulation and numerical solution of the full stick and slip frictionless contact cases, 
using the proposed DEA. Section 5 shows the key conservation properties exhibited by the time 
stepping algorithms used in the numerical analysis of dynamic contact problems, for both the 
full stick and slip frictionless cases. Finally, Section 6 deals with an assessment of the energy-
momentum conserving schemes proposed within the framework of the DEA, through a number 
of representative numerical examples, under full stick and slip frictionless dynamic contact 
conditions. The paper concludes with some final remarks. An Appendix, including the 
computation of the variations of the covariant tangent vectors ,nξ α+τ  and ,nη α+τ  at the 
configuration n α+  of the closest-point-projection on the master surface, has been added.

Let dim2 3n≤ ≤  be the space dimension and [ ]: 0,T += ⊂   the time interval of interest. Let 
the open sets dim(1) nΩ ⊂   and dim(2) nΩ ⊂  , with smooth boundaries (1)∂Ω and (2)∂Ω  and 
closures 

(1) (1) (1)Ω = Ω ∂Ω  and 
(2) (2) (2)Ω = Ω ∂Ω , be the reference placement of two 

continuum bodies (1)  and (2) . 
 For each body ( )i  we denote by 

( )( ) ii ∈ΩX  the vector position of the material 
particles at the reference configuration, dim

( )( ) :
i ni  Ω × →ϕ  the orientation preserving 

deformation maps, ( ) ( ):i it= ∂V ϕ  the material velocities, 
( ) ( ) ( ):i i i= −u Xϕ  the material 

displacements, ( )0
iρ  the reference mas densities, and ( ) ( ): GRADi i=F ϕ  the deformation 

gradients, where GRAD  denotes the material gradient operator. For each time t ∈  , the 
mapping ( )( ) ( ): ,i itt t∈ = ⋅ϕ ϕ  represents a one-parameter family of configurations indexed 
by time t , which maps the reference placement of body ( )i  onto its current placement 

( ) dim( ) ( ) ( ): ni i it tϕ ⊂   . The current placement of particles 
( )( ) ii ∈ΩX  at time t ∈   is 

denoted as ( )( ) ( ) ( ): ,i i i t=x Xϕ . 
We will asume that no contact forces are present between the two bodies at the 

reference configuration. Subsequent configurations cause the two bodies to physically come 
into contact and produce contact interactive forces during some portion of the time interval of 
interest [ ]: 0,T += ⊂  . 

For each body ( )i  we will consider the following partitions of the boundary

2.2 Local formulation of the contact problem 

Using the classical slave-master formulation of contact mechanics [1],[2],[23],[26],[40] let us 
denote the contact surfaces (1)cΓ  and 

(2)
cΓ  as slave and master contact surfaces, respectively. 

Particles of the slave and master contact surfaces will be denoted as slave particles and master 
particles, respectively.  

 Let us consider a slave particle (1) (1)c∈ΓX , being ( )(1) (1) (1) (1), ct γ= ∈x Xϕ  its current 
spatial vector position of the slave particle at time t ∈  , and ( )(1) (2), ct γ∈y X  its closest-point-
projection onto the spatial configuration (2)cγ  of the master surface

where n  is the outward unit normal to the spatial configuration of the master surface at the

(1) (1)

where ( )ext iΠ  is the potential energy for the external forces of body ( )i . 
 It can be shown [5],[6],[14],[24],[34],[35],[36],[37] that the linear momentum L , 
angular momentum J , and total energy E  are conserved for a homogeneous Neumann 
boundary problem, characterized by zero body forces and zero natural boundary conditions, 
yielding zero potential energy for the external loads, i.e. 0extΠ = . The total energy E  is also 
conserved if the external loading is conservative. A typical case of conservative external loading 
is the case of gravitational body forces and constant prescribed nominal tractions. 
 
 
3 Finite element formulation of the continuum problem without frictional contact 

constraints 
 
Let us consider first the finite element discretization of the dynamic continuum problem without 
frictional contact constraints. Using a standard finite element discretization, the material vector 
position ( ) ( )i ih∈ΩX , displacement 

( )iu  and material velocitie ( )iV  of the particles of body ( )i

Consider the time interval of interest [ ]0,T=�  discretized into a series of non-

Using a mid-point time integration algorithm, the time discretization and finite element 
discretization of the variational form of the momentum balance equation for the dynamic case 
yields a discrete energy and momentum conserving time stepping algorithm, where the residual 
force vector of a node A of body ( )i  at time 1n + , takes the form

 It can be shown [3],[4],[5],[6] that using this conserving time integration scheme, the 
full discrete version of the linear momentum hL , angular momentum hJ , and total energy hE  
are conserved for a homogeneous Neumann boundary problem, characterized by no imposed 
boundary displacements and zero external loading, zero body forces and zero natural boundary 
conditions, yielding zero semi-discrete external force vector, ( )ext iA =f 0 , and zero semi-discrete 
potential energy for the external loads, 0exthΠ = . The discrete versión of the total energy hE  is 
also conserved if the external loading is conservative. The full discrete versión of the total

4 Direct elimination algorithm for contact problems 
 
4.1 Introduction and notation 

Within the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems proposed in this work, the 
restrictions arising by the contact between the bodies are introduced through the direct 
elimination of the displacements of the slave nodes. From a computational implementation point 
of view, this direct elimination method is carried out through a number of transformations made 
on the global tangent operator. In order to conveniently visualize those transformations, let us 
introduce the following notation.  

Let us consider a generic slave node s  which is in contact with a given master element. 
Let us denote by { }1, , mnodm m  the set of master nodes of the master element which is in 
contact with the slave node s , where mnod  is the number of nodes of the master element. 

Furthermore, let us introduce the following notation for the set of nodes of the slave 
body which are connected to the slave node s , including both the nodes on the slave surface 
and the nodes in the interior domain of the slave body, and to the set of nodes of the master 
surface which are connected to the master nodes { }1, , mnodm m , including both the nodes of 
the master surface and the nodes in the interior domain of the master body.  



10  C. Agelet de Saracibar, D. Di Capua  
    

  

Let us denote by { }1, , gsnodgs gs  the set of nodes of the slave body connected to the 
given slave node s , where gsnod  is the number of nodes of this set, and let us denote by 
{ }1, , gmnodgm gm  the set of nodes of the master body connected to the set of nodes 
{ }1, , mnodm m , where gmnod  is the number of nodes of this set.  

Figure 1 shows the notation introduced for a typical slave node-master segment 2D 
contact problem using linear elements. 

Linked to the notation introduced above for the slave and master nodes, let us introduce 
the following notation for the vector of displacements. Let us denote as su  the vector of 
displacements of the slave node s , mu  the vector collecting the displacements of the set of 
nodes { }1, , mnodm m , gsu  the vector collecting the displacements of the set of nodes 
{ }1, , gsnodgs gs , and gmu  the vector collecting the displacements of the set of nodes 
{ }1, , gmnodgm gm , 1gu  the vector collecting the vector of displacements of the remaining set 
of nodes of body (1)  and 2gu  the vector collecting the vector of displacements of the 
remaining nodes of body (2) .

4.3 Full stick frictional and frictionless contact cases 

Let us denote as ,s n α+f  the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s  at time n α+ , and 
,m n α+f  the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the master element 

at time n α+ , where, typically, 1/ 2α =  for the dynamic case. The discrete residual force

4.3.1 Full stick frictional contact case 

Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s  is subjected to the 
constraints arising from the full stick frictional contact condition. Note that for the full stick 
frictional case, once the slave node comes into contact with a master surface, the isoparametric 
coordinates of the closest-point-projection are time-independent, remaining constant in time 
while contact is active. 

Using a discrete linear momentum and energy conserving time integration scheme, the 
mid-point velocity of the slave node s  is matched to the mid-point velocity of its closest-point-
projection, yielding the following expression [3]:

 ( ), 1 , , 1 , , 1 , 1,s n s n m n m n s n m n+ + + += + − ∆ = ∆x x N x x u N u  (35) 
 

Note that it is not posible to get an algorithm simultaneously satisfying discrete energy 
and angular momentum conservation [3]. The discrete contact constraint (34) yields a time 
discrete energy conservation algorithm, but the conservation of the discrete angular momentum 
is not satisfied.  

 
Remark 1. Alternatively, imposing as contact constraint that the mid-point position of the slave 
node s  has to be equal to the mid-point position of its closest-point-projection, would yield a 
discrete momentum conservation algorithm, but then the discrete energy conservation would not 
be satisfied [3].

where sδu  and mδu  are virtual displacements of the slave and master element nodes, such 
that, taking into account that the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection 
remain constant, yields, 
 
 s mδ δ=u N u  (37)

4.3.1.2 Update of slave and master displacements and contact status 

Once the resulting incremental iterative problem has been solved, the slave and master 
displacements are updated according to the following expressions. 
 Using a discrete linear momentum and energy conserving algorithm, the update of the 
master and slave and displacements takes the form,

Once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been updated, the nodal 

velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19). 
The contact status at time n α+  has to be verified, checking out if the contact is still 

active or not. The contact will be still active if the contact normal force ,:nN s n nf α α α+ + += ⋅f n  
satisfies the following condition: 
 
 ( ), , 1 , 1: , 0nN s n n s s n gs n nf α α α α+ + + + + += ⋅ = ⋅ ≥f n g u u n  (46) 
 

Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s  has to be 
deactivated for the next time step. 
 

4.3.2 Frictionless contact case 

Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s  is subjected to the 
constraints arising from the frictionless contact condition. Note that, contrary to the full stick 
frictional case, for the frictionless case, the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-
projection are not constant in time. For the sake of concreteness, only 3D dynamic frictionless 
contact cases will be presented here, being straightforward to particularize the formulation for 
2D cases.  

A discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy conserving algorithm is 
obtained, imposing that the normal component of the slave node at the mid-point configuration 
has to be equal to the normal component of the velocity of its closest-point-projection at the 
mid-point configuration, yielding,

in the diagonal position ( )dim dim,n n . The matrix 1 001knβ + 1  is added in order to avoid the ill-

and the variation of kn α+N  in (57), respectively. For convenience, those variations are given in 
the Appendix 1. Note that for linear elements the condition =A 0  holds. 
 Note that, following this procedure, the number of equations of the system is kept 
constant. Once convergence has been achieved, the increment of displacements , 1s n+∆u  is 
computed in terms of , 1m n+∆u  and 1n+∆ξ  using (49)3. 
 
Remark 4. Note that, using the formulation presented here, block-symmetry of the resulting 
global tangent stiffness matrix for the frictionless case is also maintained, in contrast to what 
happened in the formulation shown in Di Capua & Agelet de Saracibar (2015) [9].

such that, it is ensured that the discrete frictionless contact kinematic constraint given by (48) 
and (49) is satisfied, and the discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy are 
conserved. 

Once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been updated, the nodal 
velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19). 

Once the displacements have been updated, the contact status has to be checked out in 
order to decide if it has to be keep as active or if it has to be deactivated for the next step. The 
contact will be still active if the contact normal force ,:nN s n nf α α α+ + += ⋅f n  satisfies the following 
condition:

Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s  has to be 
deactivated for the next time step. 
 
 
5 Conservation properties of the proposed algorithm for the dynamic contact case 
 
5.1 Full stick frictional contact case 

The proposed contact algorithm exhibits the following conservation properties for the full stick 
frictional contact case: conservation of the discrete linear momentum for a homogeneous 
Neumann problem, and conservation of the discrete total energy for constant gravitational 
loading. It must be pointed out that for the full stick frictional contact case the discrete angular 
momentum is not conserved. 
 
5.1.1 Conservation of the discrete linear momentum

displacements and zero external forces, such that,

6 Numerical examples 

In this section a selection of representative dynamic contact numerical examples, that illustrate 
the performance and conservation properties inherited by the contact formulation proposed, is 
shown. Two frictionless and one full stick friction dynamic contact numerical examples have 
been chosen. 
 The first example deals with the numerical simulation of the dynamic impact of three 
aligned quasi-rigid cylinders sliding on a frictionless rigid surface. Here the goal is to show the 
conservation of the discrete total linear momentum, discrete total angular momentum and 
discrete total energy exhibited by the contact algorithm proposed. 
 The second example deals with the numerical simulation of the dynamic impact of two 
elastic hollow cylinders sliding on a frictionless rigid surface. Here, once again, the goal is to 
show that the proposed formulation exhibits the conservation of the discrete total linear 
momentum, discrete total angular momentum and discrete total energy.  

Finally, the last example deals with the numerical simulation of an elastic ball bouncing 
on a rigid surface. Full stick friction conditions are considered here. Now the goal is to show 
that the proposed contact formulation exhibits the conservation of the discrete total energy. 
 The numerical simulations have been performed using an enhanced version of the finite 
element program RamSeries [33] developed by COMPASS, a spin-off company of CIMNE.

6.1 Impact of three aligned quasi-rigid cylinders sliding on a frictionless rigid surface 

This example leads with the impact of three aligned quasi-rigid cylinders sliding on a rigid 
surface. Frictionless contact conditions between each one of the cylinders and between each one 
of the cyinders and the sliding surface have been considered. The radius of the cylinders is 0.1 
m. Elastic Saint-Venant material models with Young’s elastic modulus E=2.1E+09 Pa and 
Poisson’s coefficient ν=0.3, have been considered. The mass density of the material is 2500 
Kg/m3. Cylinder 1 has an initial velocity of 1.0 m/sec in the x-direction. 

The cylinders have been discretized using standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement 
tetrahedral finite elements. Figure 2 shows the geometry, initial conditions and finite element 
meshes of the three cylinders. Time increments of 0.002 sec have been considered.

mesh and initial conditions  

 
 

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the positions of the three cylinders at different time 
steps. It can be shown that when the first cylinders impact on the second one, the first one stops 
and transfers its full velocity to the second one. This effect is repeated when the second cylinder 
impacts the third one. This phenomen, which can be usually observed in the pool game when 
aligned balls impact, is due to the conservation of the total linear momentum and total energy 
conservation.The proposed contact model is able to conserve the total linear momentum, total 
angular momentum and the total energy, as it is shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

6.2 Impact of two elastic hollow cylinders sliding on a frictionless rigid surface  

This example leads with the impact of two elastic hollow cylinders sliding on a rigid surface. 
Frictionless contact conditions between the three cylinders and between each one of the 
cyinders and the sliding surface have been considered. The radius of the cylinders is 0.1 m. 
Elastic Saint-Venant material models with Young’s elastic modulus E=2.1E+05 Pa and 
Poisson’s coefficient ν=0.3, have been considered. The mass density of the material is 2500 
Kg/m3. Cylinder 1 has an initial velocity of 1.0 m/sec in the x-direction. 

The cylinders have been discretized using standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement 
tetrahedral finite elements. Figure 7 shows the geometry, initial conditions and finite element 
meshes of the two cylinders. Time increments of 2.0e-4 sec have been considered.

Figure 8 shows the evolution of the positions of the three cylinders at different time 
steps. Despite the fact that frictionless conditions have been considered, Figure 8 shows that the 
cylinders rotate around their axes. This is an undesirable effect due to the finite element 
discretization of the cylinders. Unless an extremely fine mesh is used, the unit normal to the 
master surface at the closest-point-projection does not pass through the axis of the cylinder, 
leading to a moment when the cylinders come into contact. A similar effect can be found in the 
results shown in [3]. Despite those undesirable effects, the proposed contact model is able to 
conserve the total linear momentum, total angular momentum and the total energy, as it is 
shown on Figures 9, 10 and 11, respectively.

6.3 Elastic ball bouncing on a rigid rough surface 

This example deals with the numerical simulation of an elastic ball bouncing on a rigid surface. 
The ball is a spherical crown with internal radius of 0.20 m and external radius of 0.40 m. An 
elastic Saint-Venant material model with Young’s elastic modulus of 4.0E+06 Pa and Poisson’s 
coefficient of 0.45 is used. The mass density of the ball is 1000 Kg/m3. Only the self-weight of 
the ball is considered as loading conditions. The center of the ball is initially located at 1 m of 
the rigid surface. An initial velocity of 2.0 m/sec in the y-direction is considered. Full stick 
contact conditions are considered. 

The ball has been discretized using standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement tetrahedral 
finite elements. The finite element mesh used for the discretization of the ball consists of 8299 
elements and 1571 nodes. The rigid surface has been discretized using 4 shell elements. All the 
degrees of freedom of the shell elements have been prescribed to zero. Time increments of 
0.001 secs have been used. Figure 12 shows the geometry and finite element meshes used in the 
numerical simulation. 

Figure 13 shows the deformed configurations of the ball at different time steps. It can be 
observed that the ball impact the rigid surface at the time steps 0.42 sec, 1.25 sec and 2.01 sec. 
Due to the full stick contact condition, a rotation of the ball takes place when it impacts on the 
rigid surface. The angular momentum of the ball is increasing each time it contacts the rigid 
surface. It can be also observed that the translation velocity of the ball is decreasing in order to 
keep constant the kinetic energy.  

Figure 14 shows the time evolution of the total, kinetic, elastic and potential energies. 
Despite the fact that a full stick contact condition has been considered, the total energy is 
conserved. This is due to the fact that the work done by the frictional tractions is zero, because

the frictional slip is zero due to the full stick contact condition. This results in a perfect rotation 
of the ball on the rigid surface, without any slip motion.  

It can be also observed that different effects take place every time the ball comes into 
contact with the rigid surface. The kinetic energy is increasing due to the elastic vibration of the 
ball generated by the impact. Similarly, the potential energy is decreasing because the ball is 
falling due to the increase of the elastic energy. It can be also observed a slight decrease of the 
maximum kinetic energy, being also compatible with the increase of the elastic energy.

7 Conclusions 

The focus of this work has been placed on energy-momentum conserving schemes formulated 
within the framework of the direct elimination method. Energy-momentum conservation 
properties have been addressed for two particular cases of interest in dynamic contact problems 
using the DEA: full stick friction and slip frictionless. For the full stick frictional case the main 
goal was to show that the resulting algorithm was inheriting the energy conservation property 
shown at the continuum level. For the slip frictionless case the goal was to show that the 
resulting algorithm was inheriting both the energy and momentum conservation properties 
shown at the continuum level. Note that, as those conservation properties do not hold under slip 
frictional conditions, this case has not been considered and its formulation within the framework 
of the DEA is out of the scope of interest of this work. 

Constraints arising in full stick and frictionless contact problems have been imposed in 
a strong fashion by a direct elimination of the involved degrees of freedom of the resulting 
system of equations. A more convenient and natural formulation of the direct elimination 
method for the slip frictionless case has been derived. This formulation has been given in terms 
of the contravariant components of the iso-parametric coordinates of the incremental slip of the 
closest-point-projection on the covariant basis vectors evaluated at the mid-point configuration. 

An assessment of the performance of the resulting algorithms has been shown in a 
number of selected dynamic contact numerical examples, under full stick friction and slip 
frictionless conditions. The first two examples deal with the numerical simulation of the 
dynamic impact of three aligned quasi-rigid cylinders sliding on a frictionless rigid surface, and 
the numerical simulation of the dynamic impact of two elastic hollow cylinders sliding on a 
frictionless rigid surface. Here the goal was to show the conservation of the key discrete 
properties (total linear momentum, total angular momentum, and total energy) exhibited by the 
time stepping contact algorithm proposed. It has been shown that conservation of those key 
discrete properties exhibited at the continuum level, are also preserved by the time stepping 
algorithm. The last example deals with the numerical simulation of an elastic ball bouncing on a

rough rigid surface. Full stick friction conditions were considered. Here the goal was to show 
that the proposed contact formulation exhibits the conservation of the discrete total energy. It 
has been shown that discrete total energy is fully conserved by the time stepping algorithm.
