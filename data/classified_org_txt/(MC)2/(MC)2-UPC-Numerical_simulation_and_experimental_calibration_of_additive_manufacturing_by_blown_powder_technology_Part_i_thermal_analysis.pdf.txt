Abstract

In this work, the numerical simulation of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) process known
as blown powder technology is addressed. Speci�cally, Ti-6Al-4V metal powder is injected into
the molten pool created by a focused high-energy laser beam and sintered according to the
pre-speci�ed scanning sequence. The result is a layer-by-layer metal deposition which can be
used to build-up complex structures for components such as turbine blades, aircraft sti¤eners,
cooling systems, medical implants, among others.
The present Part I deals with the thermal analysis, while a subsequent Part II paper will

target the mechanical stress analysis.
The numerical model proposed here adopts an apropos FE activation technology, which

reproduces the same scanning pattern set for the numerical control system of the AM machine.
This consists of a complex sequence of polylines, used to de�ne the contour of the component, and
hatch patterns to �ll the inner section. The full scanning sequence is given through the Common
Layer Interface (CLI) format, a standard input used for di¤erent manufacturing processes such
as Rapid Prototyping (RP), Shape Metal Deposition (SMD) and machining processes.
The outcome of the proposed numerical model is calibrated with the experimental work

carried out at SKLSP laboratories, where a Laser Solid Forming (LSF) machine, also referred to
as Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), is used to fabricate components by metal deposition.
The objectives of the present paper are three-fold: �rstly, to calibrate the numerical formula-

tion for the simulation of the AM process by blown powder technology, secondly, to show that a
properly calibrated numerical model achieves high-�delity reproduction of experimental results,
and, thirdly, to investigate the sensitivity of the numerical model to both process parameters
and thermo-physical material properties.
The thermal calibration of the computational model has direct impact in the subsequent

stress and distortion analysis. Thermal deformations induced by the heating and cooling phases,
as well as the shrinkage phenomena occurring during the sintering process of the powder material
injected into the welding pool, are responsible for the possible quality defects of the fabricated
component and the residual stresses induced by the manufacturing process. These aspects are
studied in the Part II sequel of this work.

1 Introduction

Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing or Rapid Prototyping (RP), is a relatively
novel technique to make parts, layer upon layer, directly from 3D model data. It is the opposite
of subtractive manufacturing processes such as machining. 3D printing means that the fabrication
makes use of print-heads or nozzles among other printing technologies.

This work focuses on the AM technologies for Metal Deposition (MD) by melting and sintering
metal powders (e.g. titanium, Inconel, steel) making use of high-energy sources such as Electron
Beam or laser.

The key bene�t of the AM process is the freedom of design allowing for complex shapes, inner
cavities impossible to produce by machining, very thin walls di¢ cult to produce by casting, light
weight parts with lattice/foam inner structures. The process �exibility allows for customized design
in short production time where multiple pieces can be built as one without the need of complex
tooling (e.g. moulds). Another advantage of this process consists of the rapid cooling of each
deposited layer and, consequentially, a �ner grain size compared to other metal forming technologies
such as casting or forming.

A large number of products can be produced using AM technology: turbine blades, aircraft
sti¤eners, jet engine parts, microturbines, fuel injection swirlers are some examples in the aeronau-
tical sector. Brackets, hydraulic manifolds, cooling systems, propellers, heat shields and di¤erent
tooling inserts are also candidate products in the transport sector. Dental bridges as well as many
di¤erent implants for the medical surgery and even a large variety of consumer goods can be also
produced using this technology.

There are di¤erent AM processes using metal powder technology under rapid development.
They can be classi�ed in two main families:

1. Powder bed technologies. This is the case in Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Selective Laser
Sintering (SLS), where the metal powder is melted by a laser beam. Alternatively, in Electron
Beam Melting (EBM) the metal powder is melted by an electron beam after a preheating step.
Precision inkjet printing where the metal powder is mixed with a binder and after the printing
operation, the part is consolidated by sintering. The main features of these technologies are
the possibility of working with complex shapes, including small internal cavities thin walls,
and a high-quality surface �nishing.

2. Blown powder or powder feeding technologies, also known as Laser Metal Deposition or Laser
cladding. In this process, the metal powder is blown coaxially to the laser beam which melts
the particles on a substrate to form a metallurgical bond when cooled. Laser Engineered
Net Shaping (LENS) or Laser Solid Forming (LSF) make use of this technology allowing
for higher powder deposition rates compared to the powder bed technologies as well as the
manufacturing of larger parts using coarser metal powders (Zhang et al 2009), (Tan et al
2010), (Tan et al 2010b) and (Huang et al 2014).

Many researchers have used the FE method to study additive manufacturing technologies,
often taking advantage from the experience acquired in modeling welding processes (Aggarangsi et
al 2003), (Labudovic et al 2003), (Jendrzejewski et al 2004), (Jendrzejewski et al 2007), (Zekovic

et al 2005), (Yang et al 2010), (Chiumenti et al 2010), (Anca et al 2011), (Marimuthu et al 2013),
(Denlinger et al 2014), (Kelly et al 2014) and (Heigel et al 2015).

In this work, additive manufacturing (AM) by blown powder technology is addressed at two
complementary levels: experimental and computational. The experimental work accurately por-
trays the manufacturing process in terms of both temperature and displacement evolution at dif-
ferent locations during the full duration of the AM process and the following cooling phase. The
computational model is calibrated according to the experimental data. Thereafter, the resulting
model may be used con�dently to design more and more complex scanning patterns minimizing
distortions, residual stress and hot-cracking risk.

The outline of the paper is as follows. The analytical and FE frameworks to deal with the
analysis of the AM process are presented �rst. The description of the activation technique necessary
to simulate the layer-by-layer metal deposition is detailed. The experimental work carried out at
the State Key Laboratory of Solidi�cation Processing (SKLSP) using a LSF machine is described
next. The experimental setup and the thermal properties of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy are reported.
Finally, the numerical results of the calibration and sensitivity analysis performed are shown.

2 Heat transfer analysis

Both the heating and the cooling phases of the AM process are controlled by the balance of energy
equation. This can be stated as:

_H = �r � q+ _Q+ _Dmech (1)

where _H is the enthalpy rate (per unit of volume), q is the heat �ux, while _Q and _Dmech represent
the heat source (per unit of volume) and the thermo-mechanical dissipation rate (per unit of
volume), respectively.

For the AM process, the heat source is the energy input of the laser within the molten-pool
formed along the scanning path and through the thickness of the substrate. The thermo-mechanical
dissipation can be neglected in front of the power source of the laser beam.

The enthalpy H (T; fL) is a state variable de�ned as a function of the temperature, T , and the
liquid fraction, fL. Hence, the enthalpy rate in (1) results in:

_H (T; fL) =
@H

@T
_T +

@H

@fL
_fL = C _T + L _fL (2)

where C (T ) = @H
@T

is the (temperature dependent) heat capacity and L = @H
@fL

is the latent heat
released during the phase-change process.

The heat capacity is usually de�ned as: C = �c, the product of the material density, �, and the
speci�c heat, c.

During the phase transformation the material volume, V , can be split into liquid and solid
phases as: V = VL + VS . The liquid and solid fractions are de�ned as: fL =

VL
V
and fS =

VS
V
,

respectively, so that: fL + fS = 1. The evolution of the liquid fraction
:
fL or, alternatively,:

fS = �
:
fL de�nes the phase change, that is, how the latent heat is absorbed or released during the

transformation.

Remark 1 The energy input induces the fusion of the material in the molten-pool followed by the
solidi�cation process which produces the coalescence of the metal powder on the substrate forming
the new layer. The energy balance (accounting for the energy absorbed during the melting and the
energy released during the solidi�cation) is null and very localized in the Heat A¤ected Zone (HAZ).

Remark 2 The amount of latent heat is negligible in front of the energy input coming from the
laser. Moreover, the HAZ is very narrow and the phase change occurs very quickly compared to the
thermal di¤usion process, so that its global e¤ect is negligible in the heat transfer analysis.

The heat �ux (per unit of surface) q, is computed as a function of the temperature gradient
through the Fourier�s law as:

q =� krT (3)
where k (T ) is the (temperature dependent) thermal conductivity. Due to the high conductivity of
the metallic materials, the thermal di¤usion process is the key mechanism of the metal deposition,
driving the heat transfer in the manufacturing process.

Let V be an open and bounded domain in Rndim where ndim is the number of dimensions of the
space, closed by the smooth boundary S = ST [ Sq where the corresponding boundary conditions
are de�ned in terms of either prescribed temperature on ST or prescribed heat �ux on Sq. Suitable
initial conditions for the transient thermal problem are de�ned in terms of initial temperature �eld:
T (t = 0) = To.

The resulting weak (integral) form of the energy balance equation (1), used for the heat transfer
analysis, can be written as:R

V

h�
�c _T + L _fL

�
�T
i
dV +

R
V

[krT �r (�T )] dV =W extther 8�T (4)

where �T are the variations of the temperature �eld, compatible with the Dirichlet boundary
conditions (test functions), and W extther denotes the external work of the thermal loads:

W extther (�T ) =

Z
V

h�
_Dmech + _Q

�
�T
i
dV +

Z
Sq

[(�q + qcond + qconv + qrad) �T ] dS (5)

The prescribed heat �ux, �q, de�ned in (5), can be used to spread part of power input over the
surface of the substrate.

The heat loss by convection, qconv, can be taken into account using the Newton�s law as:

qcond = hconv (T � Tenv) (6)

where hconv (T ) is the (temperature dependent) Heat Transfer Coe¢ cient (HTC) by convection,
while T and Tenv are the temperatures of material surface and the surrounding environment, re-
spectively (see (Chiumenti et al 2008)).

Remark 3 It is common to assume a constant value for the temperature of the surrounding en-
vironment, assuming that the process does not a¤ect its value. This is not the case when the AM
process is carried out in a closed chamber in a controlled atmosphere (e.g. argon to prevent the
surface oxidation). The duration of the process is generally very long and a lot of energy is scat-
tered in the chamber. The result is an increment of the environment temperature that cannot be
neglected.

Similarly, the heat �ux due to the heat conduction process between the component and the
clamping system, qcond, can be computed as:

qcond = hcond (T � Tclamp) (7)

where hcond (T ) is the (temperature dependent) HTC by conduction between the two materials in
contact, and Tclamp is the temperature of the clamping system.

Remark 4 The HTC by conduction is de�ned as the inverse of the thermal resistivity between
the two material in contact and it depends on di¤erent parameters de�ned at the contact interface
such as the contact pressure and the surface roughness, among others. Considering contact between
metallic materials, the value of the HTC is very high, around 1000

�
W=m2K

�
. Hence, Newton�s

law can be replaced by prescribing the temperature at the corresponding contact surface, ST as:
T = Tclamp.

Remark 5 Tclamp represents the temperature of the clamping system used to hold the substrate
where the AM process takes place. Also in this case, its value cannot be assumed as constant in
time if the thermal inertia of the substrate is comparable to the one of the clamping system (this
was the case in our work). In fact, the high temperatures registered in the substrate are transmitted
to the clamping system through the contact interface between them. This interface exhibits a very
low thermal resistance to the heat �ux when two metallic components are pressed together. Hence,
the value of Tclamp should be known (or estimated) to avoid including the clamping system as part
of the thermal analysis.

Finally, the radiation heat �ux, qrad, is the most important condition to dissipate the heat of
the molten-pool and, more generally, at the HAZ, due to the high temperature �eld induced by the
heat source. The radiation heat �ux can be computed using Stefan�Boltzmann�s law as:

qrad = �rad"rad
�
T 4 � T 4env

�
(8)

where �rad is the Stefan�Boltzmann constant and "rad is the emissivity parameter, respectively.

Remark 6 Stefan�Boltzmann�s law can be rewritten as:

qrad = hrad (T � Tenv) (9)

where hrad (T ) is the (temperature dependent) HTC by radiation de�ned as:

hrad (T ) = �rad"rad
�
T 3 + T 2Tenv � TT 2env � T

3
env

�
(10)

This format is interesting for two reasons: �rstly, because it is possible to linearize the contribution
of the heat radiation term as:

qrad = hrad (T
n)
�
Tn+1 � Tenv

�
(11)

where Tn+1 = T
�
tn+1

�
is the current temperature at time tn+1, and and Tn = T (tn) is temperature

in the previous time-step. The second reason is that it is extremely di¢ cult to separate the heat

losses due to convection or radiation mechanisms. Hence, the numerical model can assume a unique
HTC accounting for both heat convection and radiation terms, as:

qloss = hloss (T � Tenv) (12)

where hloss (T ) is the (temperature dependent) HTC accounting for the total heat loss through the
surrounding environment.

3 FE modeling of the AM process

The AM process is achieved by moving the heat source along a user-de�ned scanning pattern. Due
to this localized heat input, sintering transforms the metal powder, injected into the molten-pool,
into a new layer of material.

The numerical simulation of this procedure requires an ad-hoc procedure to apply the (volu-
metric) heat source (focussed on the substrate) to those elements a¤ected by the moving energy
input as well as to activate the elements forming the sintered layer (which is advancing following the
powder deposition). Therefore, at each time-step of the simulation, a searching algorithm is used
to identify the elements within the molten-pool as well as those representing the advancing metal
deposition layer. This activation strategy, referred to as born-dead-elements technique, classi�es the
elements de�ned in the original �nite element mesh into: active, inactive and activated elements.
The active elements (e.g. the mesh which de�ne the substrate) are computed and assembled into
the global matrix. The inactive elements, such as the entire discretized domain where the scanning
path is de�ned, are not included as part of the model: they have been generated but do not play any
role in the computational model. At each time-step a number of elements (activated elements) are
switched on according to the powder deposition along the scanning sequence de�ned by the user.
Only active and activated elements are assembled into the solution model (see also (Chiumenti et
al 2010)).

The advantage of this activation technique is the possibility of de�ning the computational mesh
independently from the scanning-path. In particular, a structured FE mesh can be de�ned assuming
a Cartesian grid discretization of the computational domain. This results in an easy and fast mesh
generation which coincides, most of the time, with the movement of the heat source while �lling
the inner structures (hatch scanning) to obtain a solid model.

Remark 7 The quiet elements technique is an alternative method. This considers that all the
elements of the mesh de�ning the successive layers, which will be deposited during the process simu-
lation, are included into the initial computational model. These elements are made passive (quiet)
by setting material properties which do not a¤ect the rest of the model (penalization). Very low
values for both heat capacity and thermal conductivity are considered. Later on, following to the
metal deposition process, the elements are activated, meaning that their real thermo-physical prop-
erties are re-established ((Heigel et al 2015)). This approach has di¤erent drawbacks: �rstly, the
simulation process is performed assembling all the elements and solving the full system of equations
leading to a very high computational cost. Secondly, the penalization of the material properties of
the passive elements induces an ill-conditioning of the solution matrix which may cause numerical
problems for its solution such as a reduction of the convergence ratio of iterative solvers. Further-
more, when the focus is the stress analysis, �ctitious strains are accumulated in the quiet elements

and they will be transformed into spurious stresses when these elements are activated, spoiling the
solution.

One of the added features of this work is the possibility of specifying the position of the laser
source using the same input data as for the AM machine. The scanning-path is de�ned by a Com-
mon Layer Interface (CLI) format described in the following section. This is a great advantage,
as it simpli�es the end-user work by integrating the machine directives with the software interface.
The scanning-path de�nes the sequence of points along the scanning trajectory and also the ref-
erence plane where the energy beam is focussed. It makes no reference either to the size of the
molten-pool or to the thickness of the deposited layer. The cross-section of the layer deposited, that
is, its thickness and width, as well as the spot-size of the laser beam must be speci�ed separately
to de�ne completely the simulation process.

Remark 8 The objective of the present work is the analysis of the AM process at global level
(component scale) where the size of the layer section is assumed as known. The study of the process
at local level (molten-pool analysis) is out of the scope of this work. The local level approach is used
to characterize the relationship among the di¤erent process parameters a¤ecting the powder sintering
process as: the energy input a¤ecting the temperature of the molten-pool and the surrounding HAZ
(see (Wei et al 2012) and (Wei et al 2015)), the laser-spot size, the scanning speed, the powder
feeding, etc.

From the numerical point of view, the implications derived from the space discretization (FE
mesh adopted) and the time-stepping de�ned for the time-integration of the thermal (transient)
problem must be considered.

A �rst consideration regards the discretization in time. The discrete problem is characterized
by a time-step, �t = tn+1� tn, so that a discrete sequence of computations is performed according
to the time-marching scheme. Therefore, the molten-pool does not continuously move along the
scanning path (as for the continuous problem) but, instead, it is stepping from its position at time
tn to that at time tn+1. Consequently, the power input is intermittent along the scanning path,
producing a discontinuous HAZ. The problem can be alleviated by reducing the time-step, to get
an overlapped molten-pool progression, but not completely avoided.

Alternatively, the total power input delivered within the time-step, �t, can be distributed to
the elements belonging to the volume a¤ected by the power input during this interval, which has
at both ends the molten-pools at times tn and tn+1. As a result, the molten-pool is de�ned by a
rectangular section vMD�t long (being vMD the scanning-speed) and rpool wide (as the laser-spot
size), which penetrates hpool in depth within the substrate. At the same time, a new layer of
material is added above it due to the coalescence process of the metal powder deposited. This layer
is de�ned by its average thickness and width: tMD and bMD, respectively.

A second consideration is about the space discretization. Even if the HAZ is discretized using
a very �ne mesh, it is very challenging to achieve enough spatial resolution to de�ne exactly the
ideal volume where the power input must be delivered.

Remark 9 In the literature it is possible to �nd di¤erent models to represent the heat source with
di¤erent degrees of sophistication. The double ellipsoidal power density distribution illustrated by

Goldak et al. ((Goldak et al 1984)) is the base of many models proposed for its accurate charac-
terization (e.g. (Rosenthal 1941), (Tian et al 2008), (Gajapathi et al 2011), (Rahman et al 2014)
and (Lacki et al 2011)). This is mandatory, when the focus is the local-level analysis to study the
thermal convection within the molten-pool. Nevertheless, at global-level, it is much more important
to account for the right amount of energy introduced into the HAZ, more than its local density
distribution.

According to the outcome of the searching algorithm, it is possible to sum the volume of all the
elements belonging to the (discretized) molten-pool as:

V pool =
neX
e=1

V (e)

�����
e 2 pool

(13)

so that the (average) density distribution of the heat source (per unit of volume) is computed as:

_Q =
� _P

V pool
(14)

where _P is the total energy input and � the actual heat absorption e¢ ciency. This power re-
distribution preserves the total energy input independently of the mesh used (see (Chiumenti et al
2010)).

The balance of energy equation in (4) establishes the equilibrium between the energy input and
the heat loss. The same care devoted to estimate the energy delivered by laser beam and absorbed
by the substrate must be placed to compute the heat dissipated through the boundaries of the
AM domain. This domain is also changing due to the AM process, requiring a speci�c searching
strategy to update the contour surface at each time-step of the numerical simulation. Following the

4 CLI-format to de�ne the scanning-path

The Common Layer Interface (CLI) is a universal format for the input of geometry data to model
fabrication systems based on layer manufacturing technologies (LMT). It is intended as a simple,
e¢ cient and unambiguous format independent of vendors or fabrication machines. The �exibility
of the CLI format allows for its use in a wide range of applications such as systems using layer-wise
photo-curing of resin (e.g. additive layer manufacturing processes for rapid prototyping), sintering
of powder materials (e.g. metal deposition processes using LENS or SLM technologies), cutting
and machining processes, solidi�cation of molten materials, medical scanners, and other systems
which build models on a layer-by-layer basis.

The 3D�model is sliced with parallel planes and the volume between two slices is a layer.
Hence, the geometrical model is de�ned by the sum of all the layers. The slicing plane is parallel
to the xy�plane and it is assumed that the building direction is the positive z�axis.

Each layer is de�ned by its thickness and a set of contours and hatches. Contours represent
the boundaries of the solid model within a layer, and are de�ned by polylines. Each polyline is

de�ned by a set of point coordinates (x; y), connected contiguously in the listed order by straight
line segments. A hatch is a set of independent straight lines, each de�ned by one start and one end
point. The purpose of hatches is to de�ne �lling structures to obtain the solid model.

An example of CLI �le in ASCII-format is presented in Table 1.

Both polylines and hatches are de�ned by coordinates of points. No reference to the time-
scale is mentioned. Typically, the movement of the laser-head is de�ned by two parameters: the
scanning-speed, vMD, when the laser is switched-on, and the back-speed, vback, when the laser is
switched-o¤ and it is repositioning. Hence, an automatic time-stepping �ton is de�ned by splitting
each polyline (and hatch) segment according to a �x advancing step �s of the laser-head prede�ned
by the end-user as a function of the dimensions of the solid model. When the laser is switched-
o¤, the time-increment �toff is computed as a function of the back-speed and the distance �x
between the coordinates of the last scanning point (end of polyline or hatch) and the beginning of
the following one:

�ton = �s=vMD During the laser scanning
�toff = �x=vback For repositioning

(15)

Remark 10 It is important to include the repositioning interval �toff as part of the thermal
analysis because of the the fast cooling experienced by the material during its duration.

5 Experimental work

The experimental work has been carried out at the State Key Laboratory of Solidi�cation Processing
(SKLSP) using the laser solid forming (LSF-III ) machine shown in Figure 1a. The system uses a
CO2-laser source with a maximum power input of 4 [kW ] in a closed chamber with a protective
atmosphere (argon) to prevent oxidation. Figure 1b shows the coaxial nozzle used for the powder
blowing. Its movement is monitored by a numerical control device. Temperature is measured using
OMEGA GG-K-30 thermocouples and a midi LOGGER G900-4/8 data recorder.

The substrate samples consist of Ti6Al4V Titanium alloy plates, 140 [mm] long, 50 [mm] wide
and 6 [mm] thick. Each plate is burnished by sand paper and cleaned using anhydrous-alcohol

the upper surface of the sample as shown in Figures 3a-b. Finally, the substrate is clamped to the
supporting system and anchored inside the chamber of the AM machine. The Ti6Al4V powder is
dried in a vacuum oven at 120 [oC] before supplying it to the feeding device. Figure 2a shows the

6 Material characterization

The numerical simulation of the AM process requires the characterization of the thermo-physical
properties of the material. Their values are temperature dependent, covering the full range from
room temperature to fusion temperature.

Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent properties for the Ti6Al4V titanium alloy, used for
both the substrate and the powder feeding ((Bermingham et al 2007) and (Elmer et al 2004)).

The liquidus-to-solidus phase change is de�ned by a latent heat of L = 290 [kJ=kg], together
with the liquidus and solidus temperatures of 1703 [oC] and 1697 [oC], respectively.

The substrate is clamped to a supporting structure made of stainless steel. This structure is not
analyzed, even if its thermal inertia in�uences the temperature evolution at the contact interface
with the substrate, that is, the heat loss by heat conduction through the clamping system.

7 Numerical results

This section describes the calibration of the in-house COupled MEchanical-Thermal FE software
COMET customized for the numerical simulation of the AM process (Cervera et al. 2002). Com-
putations and CPU-times refer to a laptop equipped with an i5 Intel processor.

The results obtained from the numerical simulation are presented in terms of temperature graphs
at the di¤erent thermocouple locations on the substrate, as well as temperature contour-�lls, using
the in-house pre-post-processor GiD (htpp://www.gidhome.com). These results are compared with
the corresponding measurements obtained at SKLSP research labs.

7.1 Calibration and sensitivity analysis

The calibration and sensitivity analysis have been carried out using the FE discretization shown
in Figure 5a. It consists of 12; 456 nodes and 10; 050 hexahedral elements. The average mesh
size is 2:5 [mm], with 5 elements placed through the thickness of the plate. A �ner mesh, with
average element size of 0:875 [mm], is used at the process zone to be able to capture both the
high temperature gradient induced by the AM process and the scanning pattern used for the metal
deposition (see Figure 5b). The mesh size adopted for the metal deposition closely approximates
the actual dimensions of the sintered titanium powder: 80 [mm] long, 7 [mm] wide (6:4 [mm]
expected) and 2:8 [mm] thick (3 [mm] expected). Hence, the average layer thickness is set to 0:28
[mm] while the spot-size is set to 1:75 [mm] with 50% overlapping during the scanning operation.

Note that even if the expected and the actual dimensions of the metal deposition are not very
di¤erent (less than 10%), their correct values are necessary not to over-estimate the thermal inertia
of the sintering material.

Figure 5: FE mesh used for the numerical simulation of the AM process.

The colored zone in Figure 5a represents the surface in contact with the clamping system used
to restrain the movement of the substrate plate. Conduction heat transfer at the contact interface
between the plate and the clamping system is considered. The heat transfer coe¢ cient used for
Newton�s model is 50 [W=m2K]. The temperature of the supporting structure is often assumed
as constant during the analysis because its thermal inertia is generally much higher than the one
of the sample. This was not the case in the experimental setting, so that the temperature of the
clamping surface was monitored during the entire duration of the AM process and the following
cooling phase. Figure 6b shows the temperature evolution at the clamping system as well as the
approximating curve used for the numerical simulation.

The AM process is performed in a closed chamber with a protective atmosphere to prevent
oxidation. Also in this case, the environment temperature was not constant. Figure 6a shows the
actual temperature evolution inside the chamber. Unfortunately, the thermocouple was placed too
close to the process area being a¤ected by the heat radiation during AM process. The (conservative)
environment temperature value used for both radiation and convection models is shown in Figure
6a (blue line). The HTC coe¢ cient used for the heat convection model is 10 [W=m2K] while
emissivity coe¢ cient used for the heat radiation model is 0:7.

Table 3 shows the process parameters used for the numerical simulation. These parameters
are slightly di¤erent from those in Table 2, according to the actual measurements of the metal
deposition.

Figures 7a-b show both measured and calculated temperatures at the lower and upper surfaces,
respectively. The level of agreement is remarkable. A closer view is presented in Figures 7c-d where
it is possible to appreciate the accuracy of the numerical results.

Remark 11 Thermocouples 4 and 5, placed on the upper surface of the substrate, were shielded to
protect against radiation. Nevertheless, the recorded temperatures still su¤er by the heat radiation
e¤ects.

The simulation strategy consists of 3 phases: the pre-heating phase, the AM phase and, �nally,
the cooling phase. During the simulation of the manufacturing phase, the power absorption is

in agreement with the experimental experience at SKLSP. Figures 8a-b show the sensitivity to
the power absorption parameter. This is the most important parameter of the balance of energy
equation in (4) de�ning the energy input into the system. During the pre-heating phase, the
absorption parameter is reduced up to 10%. This phase is not contemplated in the experimental
setting, but it can be clearly observed that the powder sintering is much less during the scanning
sequence de�ned for �rst layer. This is due to the low temperature of the substrate in this �rst
phase and it can also explain the mismatch (0:2 [mm] approx.) between the estimated and the
actual height of the metal deposition.

thermocouple 2 and its sensitivity to the pre-heating phase.

Remark 12 The benchmark proposed for the calibration of the numerical model only considers 10
layers of metal deposition, highlighting the di¤erence between the pre-heating and the manufacturing
phases. In the case of much higher depositions, the pre-heating phase can be neglected.

During the AM process both the substrate (at the melting pool) and the powder material
undergo the phase change: the energy input generates the molten pool and melts the blown powder.
The material is sintered, forming a new layer by the coalescence process. Both the heating and
the cooling phases are very fast and, the latent heat is �rstly absorbed (melting phase) and later,

is released (sintering phase). Hence, the e¤ect of the latent heat contribution at global level is
negligible as shown in Figures 10a-b. All the curves are perfectly overlapping. This result is
remarkable because, without considering the phase-change, the CPU-time is reduced by 3 times
(1 iteration per time step instead of 3-4 during the phase-change) making much more a¤ordable
the numerical simulation of the AM process. Table 5 shows the CPU-time of the �rst simulation
proposed (used as reference) and the case where the phase-change is not considered.

The sensitivity to the heat loss models is presented next. This is a key point when studying the
AM simulation process. The equilibrium between the energy absorption and the heat dissipation

ponent. To uncouple the two mechanisms, the heat loss has been calibrated analyzing the cooling
phase, when the energy input is switched-o¤. From the physical point of view, both heat convection
and heat radiation coexist but it is di¢ cult to split their e¤ects. In this work, the reference solution
is obtained by calibrating the heat radiation model, while keeping the HTC of the convection model
(hcond) to a constant value of 10 [W=m

2K]. The resulting emissivity coe¢ cient used for the heat
radiation model was: "rad = 0:7.

Figure 11a shows the response of the numerical model when using the heat convection model,
only. The result is incorrect from both the quantitative and qualitative points of view, both in
the cooling and heating phases. In fact, even if the HTC is increased (or the power absorption is
reduced) to capture the maximum temperature level, the temperature evolution is still far from the
experimental evidence. More speci�cally, the cooling phase is always too slow, while the heating
phase never shows the temperature saturation exhibited by the material, as shown in Figure 11b.

mechanism to dissipate the heat from the substrate is by radiation ((Heigel et al 2015)). Table 4
shows the values of hloss (T ) when using a temperature-dependent HTC for the total heat loss as

Finally, the response of the numerical model, when a simpler linear interpolation of the HTC
between 20oC and 1200oC, is presented in Figure 11d. If a maximum value of 160 [W=m2K] is
adopted as in Table 4, the temperature curves reaching too low values. Instead, when using 90
[W=m2K] as top value, the response compares better with the reference one.

Figure 12a shows the sensitivity of the model to the temperature of the surrounding environ-
ment. The di¤erence is negligible when the radiation model is used, while a small mismatch can
be observed when only the convection model is adopted, as shown in Figure 12b.

The most suitable heat loss mechanism at the contact interface between the substrate and the
clamping system is by heat conduction, using the Newton�s law presented in Eq. (7). Also in this
case, the HTC as well as the temperature of the clamping system must be de�ned. In Figure 13a
is demonstrated that the di¤erences due to the temperature de�ned at the clamping interface is
almost negligible during the heating phase. An appreciable discrepancy is shown during the cooling
phase. Using a constant value of 25oC, the �nal equilibrium temperature is lower than expected
because of the heating of the supporting structure. More important, is the de�nition of the HTC by
conduction: this is the inverse of the thermal resistivity at the contact interface. Its value depends
on the roughness of the surfaces in contact as well as on the contact pressure established. In our
case, the most suitable value was 50 [W=m2K] being far from the typical value of 1000 [W=m2K]
when the contact is almost perfect. This can be explained by the fact that the the bolts�torque
was very low because it was applied manually. Figure 13b shows the model sensitivity to the HTC
value, comparing with the calibrated numerical reference.

Finally, some considerations about the time-stepping used are necessary. The calibrated solution
makes use of an automatic time-step which moves the heat source element-by-element (Courant�s
number: Cu = 1). This hypothesis allows for the most accurate and more CPU-time consuming
result. The time-step can be increased while reducing the simulation accuracy. One interesting
option is to study the response of the numerical model when all the elements belonging to one
scanning hatch are simultaneously activated. This means 7 time-steps, and the corresponding
cooling intervals after the activation of each hatch, for each deposited layer. The result is presented
in Figures 14a-b. It is interesting to observe that, even if the hatch-by-hatch activation loses the

oscillatory response of the temperature, it conserves its average value. Also, the activation sequence
could be performed in a layer-by-layer manner. In each time-step, all the elements belonging to one
layer are activated adopting an equivalent scanning speed of 1:4 [mm=s]. The result is presented in
Figures 15a-b. Once again, the balance of energy allows for an average estimation of the temperature
pro�les while losing all the details concerning the scanning sequence.

Clearly, the advantage of these simpli�ed strategies is in the CPU-time which is notably reduced
as show in Table 5.

Remark 13 Even if the hatch-by-hatch and the layer-by-layer activation sequences may appear
promising because of the CPU-time reduction, the mechanical response can be compromised when
performing the stress analysis. In fact, the �nal microstructure, the mechanical properties, the
plastic deformations and the residual stresses are in�uenced by the complex thermal history (local
heating and cooling) induced by the scanning pattern.

8 Conclusions

In this work, a FE framework for the numerical simulation of the AM process is presented detailing
the mechanisms of energy absorption and heat dissipation through the surrounding environment.
The apropos FE activation technique is also discussed, focussing on the numerical simulation of
fabrication processes by blown powder technology.

The experimental work has been carried out at SKLSP laboratories using a Laser Solid Forming
(LSF-III) machine.

The calibration of the numerical model has demonstrated a remarkable agreement with the
experimental evidence both during the deposition process and the following cooling phase to the
room temperature.

This work has also studied the sensitivity to di¤erent process parameters as well as thermo-
physical properties. The outcome is the following:

� The model is very sensitive to the energy absorption parameter. In the case of blown powder
technology, this parameter can be adjusted around 15%. A slightly lower value (10%) can
be considered during the scanning of the �rst layer (pre-heating phase) because of the colder
temperature of the substrate at the beginning of the fabrication process.

� Heat radiation is the main mechanism to dissipate the heat through the surrounding envi-
ronment. It cannot be neglected, but it could be replaced by a temperature-dependent HTC.
The temperature variation inside the process chamber or at the clamping system can be ne-
glected, even if a better accuracy can be achieved in the cooling phase when those data are
available.

� The latent heat contribution of the liquidus-to-solidus phase-change can be avoided, saving
60% of the total CPU-time. Its e¤ect at global level is negligible.

� The simulation time can be speed-up by considering a hatch-by-hatch or either a layer-by-
layer deposition sequence. Average temperature �elds can be recovered but the accuracy of
the local thermal history is lost.

The thermal calibration of the computational model has direct impact in the subsequent stress
and distortion analysis. Thermal deformations induced by the heating and cooling phases, as well
as the shrinkage phenomena occurring during the sintering process of the powder material injected
into the molten pool, are responsible for the possible quality defects of the fabricated component
and the residual stresses induced by the manufacturing process. Thes aspects are studied in the
Part II sequel of this work.
