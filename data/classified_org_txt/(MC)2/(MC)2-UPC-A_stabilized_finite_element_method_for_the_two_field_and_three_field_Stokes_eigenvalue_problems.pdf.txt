Abstract

In this paper, the stabilized finite element approximation of the Stokes eigenvalue
problems is considered for both the two-field (displacement-pressure) and the
three-field (stress-displacement-pressure) formulations. The method presented is
based on a subgrid scale concept, and depends on the approximation of the un-
resolvable scales of the continuous solution. In general, subgrid scale techniques
consist in the addition of a residual based term to the basic Galerkin formulation.
The application of a standard residual based stabilization method to a linear eigen-
value problem leads to a quadratic eigenvalue problem in discrete form which is
physically inconvenient. As a distinguished feature of the present study, we take
the space of the unresolved subscales orthogonal to the finite element space, which
promises a remedy to the above mentioned complication. In essence, we put for-
ward that only if the orthogonal projection is used, the residual is simplified and
the use of term by term stabilization is allowed. Thus, we do not need to put the
whole residual in the formulation, and the linear eigenproblem form is recovered
properly. We prove that the method applied is convergent, and present the error
estimates for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions. We report several numerical
tests in order to illustrate that the theoretical results are validated.

1. Introduction

The finite element approximation of eigenvalue problems has been studied
extensively in recent years due to the important theoretical and practical applica-
tions. The significance of the analysis maintains its attraction, and the approxi-
mation of eigenvalue problems is still a subject of active research. In particular,
there is a wide area of research on the Stokes eigenvalue problem which can be
set into different frameworks, and some abstract results can be applied to a vari-
ety of mixed or hybrid type finite element eigenvalue approximation methods (see
e.g. [1]).

In this paper, the problem under consideration consists of finding eigenvalues
λ ∈ R and eigenfunctions u 6= 0 for a certain operator L on a given domain Ω
such that

L u = λu in Ω, (1)

accompanied with appropriate boundary conditions on ∂Ω.
Let X be a Hilbert space for which the variational form of (1) is well defined.

After normalizing u, this variational form reads: find a nonzero u ∈ X and λ ∈ R
such that

B(u, v) = λ(u, v) ∀v ∈ X , (2)

whereB is the bilinear form associated to L and (·, ·) stands for the inner product
in L2(Ω).

Let Xh be a finite dimensional space of X constructed from a finite element
partition of size h. The Galerkin discretization of (2) is: find 0 6= uh ∈ Xh and
λh ∈ R such that

B(uh, vh) = λh(uh, vh) ∀vh ∈ Xh. (3)

It is well known that when L is either the two-field or three-field Stokes oper-
ator, the standard Galerkin approach necessitates an interpolation for the different
fields satisfying the classical inf-sup (or Babuška-Brezzi) condition. Researchers
might want to avoid the use of schemes satisfying this condition. This demand
has led to many recent studies devoted to develop robust and efficient stabilized
techniques for approximating the Stokes eigenvalue problem [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It is
worth noting that there are also alternative approaches. For instance, a solution
procedure based on a pseudostress-velocity formulation, leading to a locally con-
servative scheme without using additional stabilizing terms, has been proposed
in [7].

In the convergence analysis of the eigenvalue problems, the most common ap-
proach is to deduce the error estimates and the rate of convergence from the well
known Babuška-Osborn theory [8] (see also [9] for a comprehensive review of
finite element approximation of general eigenvalue problems). In particular, the
convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the two-field Stokes problem
using mixed formulations is analyzed in many works, including [1], [9] and [10].
On the other hand, despite the extensive number of papers on finite element anal-
ysis of the eigenproblem, as well as of the source problem for the two-field Stokes
operator, few works have been published on the three-field case. Considering the
source problem, a stabilized finite element formulation based on a subgrid con-
cept is presented and analyzed for the stress-displacement-pressure formulation in
[11]. As another work, a Galerkin least-square based method is proposed in [12],
with stability and convergence results given for the three-field Stokes formulation
arising from viscoelastic models.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the stabilized finite element method for
the Stokes eigenvalue problem in both two-field and three-field formulations. The
stabilization method applied is based on a subgrid scale concept. In this method,
the unresolvable scales of the continuous solution are approximately taken into
account. In general, when a stabilization technique based on a projection P̃ of the
residual is applied to (2), one obtains a statement of the form

B(uh, vh)− λh(uh, vh)

+
∑
K

(P̃ (−L ∗vh + λhvh), αKP̃ (L uh − λhuh))K = 0, (4)

where L ∗ is the formal adjoint operator of L , and αK is a stabilization matrix (if
uh is vector valued) of numerical parameters defined within each element domain
K. Here and in the following,

∑
K stands for the summation over all elements of

the finite element partition, and (·, ·)K for the L2(K)-inner product.
It is clear from (4) that in general the resulting system leads to a quadratic

eigenvalue problem, which, apart from being much more demanding than a linear
one, could introduce eigenpairs that converge to solutions which are not solutions
of the original problem (2).

In this study, the unresolved subscales are assumed to be orthogonal to the fi-
nite element space, which amounts to say that P̃ = P⊥, the appropriate orthogonal
projection. Apart from its novelty in the context of Stokes eigenvalue problems,
this choice is essential to establish the structure of the eigenproblem in its original
form. Only in this way the components uh and vh in the last term of (4) vanish, the

3



residual is simplified, and the use of term by term stabilization is allowed. We will
show that this formulation is optimally convergent for an adequate choice of the
algorithmic parameters on which the method depends. This will be done by ap-
plying the classical spectral approximation theory of [8] to the associated source
problems in the spirit of the methodology developed in [9]. In the convergence
analysis for the two-field problem, we will make use of the stability and conver-
gence properties of the corresponding source problem, which are adapted from
[13] and [14]. For the three-field eigenvalue problem, the convergence and er-
ror estimates are based on the finite element analysis of the corresponding source
problem provided in [11]. This is the first finite element approximation to the
three-field Stokes eigenvalue problem to the best of our knowledge.

2. Problem statements

2.1. Preliminaries
Let us introduce some notation. In the following, the space of square inte-

grable functions in a domain ω is denoted by L2(ω), and the space of functions
having distributional derivatives of order up to an integer m ≥ 0 belonging to
L2(ω) by Hm(ω). The space of functions in H1(ω) vanishing on its boundary
∂ω is denoted by H10 (ω). The L

2(ω) inner product in ω for scalars, vectors and
tensors, is denoted by (·, ·)ω, and the norm in a Banach space X is denoted by
‖ · ‖X . In what follows, the domain subscript is dropped for the case ω = Ω,
‖ · ‖ represents the norm on L2(Ω), and ‖ · ‖m stands for ‖ · ‖Hm(Ω) for a positive
or negative m. A finite element partition of the domain Ω is denoted by Ph, and
K ∈ Ph denotes an element domain. The diameter of the finite element partition
is defined as h = max{hK |K ∈ Ph}, where hK is the diameter of the element do-
main K. For simplicity, we will assume quasi-uniform meshes; this will allow us
to express all estimates in terms of the mesh size h (and also to simplify the design
of the stabilization method presented below, see [13]). When K is a domain of an
element in a partition, ‖ · ‖K and ‖ · ‖m,K denote ‖ · ‖L2(K) and ‖ · ‖Hm(K), respec-
tively. Throughout the paper, the notation . is used to denote an inequality up to
a constant independent of h and of the coefficients of the differential equations.
All constants involved in the analysis are dimensionless.

2.2. The two-field Stokes eigenproblem
Let Ω be bounded and polyhedral. The two-field Stokes eigenvalue problem

is as follows: find [u, p, λ], where u 6= 0 is the displacement or velocity field, p is

4



the pressure, and λ ∈ R, such that

−µ∆u+∇p = λu in Ω,
∇ · u = 0 in Ω,
u = 0 on ∂Ω,

(5)

where µ > 0 is a physical parameter. The eigenproblem corresponding to find
pressure eigenfunctions (a mixed eigenvalue problems of second type, see [9])
will not be considered in this work.

The weak form of problem (5) is obtained in the functional spaces V =
(H10 (Ω))

d and Q = L2(Ω)/R. Setting XI = V × Q, this weak form can be
written as: find [u, p] ∈ XI and λ ∈ R such that

BI([u, p], [v, q]) = λ(u,v) ∀[v, q] ∈ XI, (6)

where

BI([u, p], [v, q]) = µ(∇u,∇v)− (p,∇ · v) + (q,∇ · u). (7)

It is well known that the inf-sup condition holds for the continuous problem
(6), and the corresponding solution operator is compact. From the spectral theory
([8]) it follows that (6) has a sequence of real eigenvalues (see also [2, 4, 15])

0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . λk . . . ≤ lim
k→∞

λk =∞,

and corresponding eigenfunctions

[u1, p1], [u2, p2], . . . , [uk, pk], . . .

which are assumed to satisfy

(ui,uj) = δij, i, j = 1, 2, . . .

The standard Galerkin approximation of the variational problem can be con-
structed on conforming finite element spaces Vh ⊂ V and Qh ⊂ Q. The discrete
version of problem (6) is given as follows: find [uh, ph] ∈ XI,h = Vh × Qh and
λh ∈ R such that

BI([uh, ph], [vh, qh]) = λh(uh,vh) ∀[vh, qh] ∈ XI,h. (8)

5



The restriction in the possible choices for the displacement and pressure spaces
dictated by the inf-sup condition motivates the use of a stabilization technique to
solve this problem. The stabilized finite element formulation adopted in this paper
has its roots in the variational multiscale formulation, where the continuous space
XI of the problem is approximated by XI,h⊕X̃I, X̃I being an approximation to the
complement of XI,h in XI.

In our study, we select X̃I to be approximately orthogonal to XI,h leading to
the so-called method of orthogonal subscales [13, 14, 16]. The resulting simplified
stabilized method for problem (8) that we shall use reads: find [uh, ph] ∈ XI,h and
λh ∈ R such that

BIS([uh, ph], [vh, qh]) = λh(uh,vh) ∀[vh, qh] ∈ XI,h, (9)

where BIS([uh, ph], [vh, qh]) is defined as

BIS([uh, ph], [vh, qh]) = BI([uh, ph], [vh, qh])

+
∑
K

α1K(P
⊥(∇ph), P⊥(∇qh))K

+ α2(P
⊥(∇ · vh), P⊥(∇ · uh)), (10)

where P⊥ = I − P , with I the identity and P the L2-projection onto the finite
element space of either scalars, vectors or tensors, the case being defined by the
argument of P ; thus, the projection of a scalar is onto the pressure space, the pro-
jection of a vector onto the velocity space and the projection of a tensor (required
later) onto the stress space. The parameters α1K and α2 are the stabilization coef-
ficients, which are computed as

α1K =
h2K
µ
c1, α2 = c2µ

where c1 and c2 are numerical constants (see [16] for more details on the method
and the stabilization parameters). In the implementation of the method, a term of
the form (P⊥(fh), P⊥(gh)) is computed as (fh, gh − P (gh)) where the projection
onto the appropriate finite element space P (gh) can either be treated implicitly or
in an iterative way.

The stabilized bilinear form BIS will be also evaluated with the solution of
the continuous problem; in these cases, enough regularity for this solution has to
be assumed. The same applies to the stabilized bilinear form of the three-field
formulation presented below.

6



Remark 1. Let us remark that in the design of the stabilization parameters one
could take into account the eigenvalue, considering that λu is a reactive-like term
(see [17]). The effect of neglecting it is that the estimates to be obtained will not be
uniform in terms of the magnitude of the eigenvalue, but this is the same situation
encountered in any Galerkin approximation of an eigenproblem, including the
inf-sup stable approximation of the Stokes problem.

2.3. The three-field Stokes eigenproblem
The three-field Stokes eigenvalue problem is written as follows: find [u, p,σ],

and λ ∈ R such that 

−∇ · σ +∇p = λu in Ω,
∇ · u = 0 in Ω,
1

2µ
σ −∇Su = 0 in Ω,

u = 0 on ∂Ω,

(11)

where u 6= 0 is the displacement field, p is the pressure, σ is the deviatoric
component of the stress field and ∇Su is the symmetrical part of ∇u. To write
the weak form of problem (11), in addition to the functional spaces V = (H10 (Ω))d
andQ = L2(Ω)/R, we define T = (L2(Ω))d×dsym as the space of symmetric tensors
of second order with square-integrable components. If we now let XII = V ×Q×
T , the weak form of the problem can be stated as the follows: find [u, p,σ] ∈ XII
and λ ∈ R such that

BII([u, p,σ], [v, q, τ ]) = λ(u,v) ∀[v, q, τ ] ∈ XII, (12)

where

BII([u, p,σ], [v, q, τ ]) = (∇Sv,σ)− (p,∇ · v) + (q,∇ · u)

+
1

2µ
(σ, τ )− (∇Su, τ ). (13)

The Galerkin finite element approximation is obtained in the usual way, by
building the conforming finite element spaces Vh ⊂ V , Qh ⊂ Q and Th ⊂ T . If
we let XII,h = Vh × Qh × Th, the problem is now: find [uh, ph,σh] ∈ XII,h and
λh ∈ R such that

BII([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) = λ(uh,vh) ∀[vh, qh, τ h] ∈ XII,h. (14)

7



It is obviously seen that the bilinear form BII([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) is not
coercive and the inf-sup condition is not satisfied unless some stringent require-
ments are posed on the choice of the finite element spaces. Thus, like for the
two-field formulation, the purpose of the stabilization used is to avoid the use of
the inf-sup conditions and, in particular, to allow equal interpolations for all the
unknowns. The same strategy as before is followed to obtain the stabilized fi-
nite element formulation, and the method becomes: find [uh, ph,σh] ∈ XII,h and
λh ∈ R such that

BIIS([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) = λh(uh,vh) ∀[vh, qh, τ h] ∈ XII,h, (15)

where BIIS([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) is given as

BIIS([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) = BII([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h])

+ α3(P
⊥(∇Svh), P⊥(∇Suh)) + α4(P⊥(∇ · vh), P⊥(∇ · uh))

+
∑
K

α5K(P
⊥(∇qh −∇ · τ h), P⊥(∇ph −∇ · σh))K . (16)

The stabilization parameters of this formulation are given by

α3 = 2µc3, α4 = 2µc4, α5K =
h2K
µ
c5

where c3, c4 and c5 are numerical constants which can be taken in a wide range,
as the analysis in [11] put forth. In this paper we consider that the finite element
spaces are built using equal continuous interpolation, although the extension to
more general spaces, and in particular of discontinuous stresses and pressures,
can be done as analyzed in [11].

3. Numerical analysis of the source problems

As we have mentioned earlier, we aim to prove that the eigensolutions of the
stabilized two-field and three-field Stokes problems converge to the solutions of
the corresponding spectral problems by applying the classical spectral approxima-
tion theory presented in [8] to the associated source problems. To achieve this, we
will present in this section the source problems for the two-field and three-field
cases, and the essential stability and convergence results. At this point, let us in-
troduce the notation for the interpolation estimates that will allow us to define the
error functions of the methods. For any v ∈ Hk′v+1(Ω), kv being the degree of an

8



approximating finite element space Wh, the interpolation errors εi(v), i = 0, 1,
are derived from the interpolation estimates as

εi(v) = h
k′′v +1−i

(∑
K

‖v‖2k′′v +1,K

)1/2
, (17)

with

inf
vh∈Wh

(∑
K

‖v − vh‖2i,K

)1/2
. εi(v), (18)

where k′′v = min(kv, k
′
v). Here we use v to represent the unknown u, σ or p, and

kv denotes the corresponding order of interpolation for each v. In the results given
below, we will define the error functions based on these definitions.

3.1. The two-field source problem
The source Stokes problem for the two-field case can be written as: given

f ∈ (L2(Ω))d, find [u, p] ∈ XI such that

BI([u, p], [v, q]) = (f ,v) ∀[v, q] ∈ XI. (19)

The corresponding stabilized formulation can be written as: find [uh, ph] ∈ XI,h
such that

BIS([uh, ph], [vh, qh]) = (f ,vh) ∀[vh, qh] ∈ XI,h, (20)

where BIS is defined in (10).
The stability and convergence properties of the method used in (20) are an-

alyzed in [13] and [14], and the following theorem is a collection of immediate
consequences of the results obtained therein:

Theorem 1. The solution of (20) satisfies the stability condition

√
µ‖uh‖1 +

1
√
µ
‖ph‖ .

1

µ
‖f‖−1. (21)

Moreover, if the solution of the continuous problem has enough regularity, then
the solution of (20) has the following optimal order of convergence

√
µ‖u− uh‖1 +

1
√
µ
‖p− ph‖ . εI(h), (22)

where εI(h) is the interpolation error given by

εI(h) =
√
µε1(u) +

1
√
µ
ε0(p). (23)

It is important to note that as the definition of εI(h) suggests, the interpolation
error is of order k′′ in terms of h, where k′′ = min(k′′u, k

′′
p + 1).

For reasons that will become clearer in the convergence theory given in Sec-
tion 4.1, we state and prove the following theorem:

Theorem 2. Assume that the continuous problem satisfies the regularity condition

The next theorem provides an analogous result for the L2 norm of the error,

Proof. The proof is carried out by using a duality argument. To do this, we let
[w, π] ∈ XI and consider the following adjoint problem:

−µ∆w −∇π = µ

`2
(u− uh) in Ω,

−∇ ·w = 0 in Ω,
w = 0 on ∂Ω,

(27)

where `, as before, is a characteristic length of the problem. The next step is to
test the first and second equations in (27) respectively with u − uh and p − ph.
Then we have
µ

`2
‖u− uh‖2 = µ(∇w,∇(u− uh)) + (π,∇ · (u− uh))− (p− ph,∇ ·w)

∑
K

(P⊥(∇ ·w), P⊥(∇ · (u− uh)))K , (28)

where we have used the definition of BIS. The last term in the expression above
vanishes because ∇ ·w = 0, and thus only the first two terms on the right-hand-
side of the last equality must be bounded. Now if we let [w̃h, π̃h] be the best
approximation to [w, π] in XI,h, the first of these terms can be bounded using the
consistency error coming from BIS([u − uh, p − ph], [w̃h, π̃h]) as follows. Since
[u, p] is the solution of the continuous problem (19), we have

BIS([u, p], [w̃h, π̃h]) = (f , w̃h) +
∑
K

α1K(P
⊥(∇p), P⊥(∇π̃h))K

Making use of (20) in (29) and noting that∇ · u = 0 yields

BIS([u− uh, p− ph], [w̃h, π̃h]) .
h2

µ
‖π‖1‖p‖1,

where we have made use of the H1-stability of the best interpolation and the
expression of α1K . This same bound clearly applies to the second term in the
right-hand-side of (28). Regarding the stabilizing terms applied to ([u − uh, p −
ph], [w − w̃h, π − π̃h]), we have that∑

K

3.2. The three-field source problem
The three-field Stokes source problem can be written as: given f ∈ (L2(Ω))d,

seek [u, p,σ] ∈ XII such that

BII([u, p,σ], [v, q, τ ]) = (f ,v) ∀[v, q, τ ] ∈ XII, (30)

12



and the stabilized formulation is: find [uh, ph,σh] ∈ XII,h such that

BIIS([uh, ph,σh], [vh, qh, τ h]) = (f ,vh) ∀[vh, qh, τ h] ∈ XII,h, (31)

where BIIS is defined in (16).
The following theorem, which is proved in [11], asserts the stability and con-

vergence of the finite element solution:

Theorem 4. The solution of (31) can be bounded as

4. Numerical analysis of the eigenvalue problems

In this section, we aim to apply the convergence analysis to the two-field and
three-field Stokes eigenproblems. Mainly, we account for the theory developed in
[9], which has its roots in the abstract spectral approximation theory of Babuška-
Osborn. The convergence results, and the error estimates for the displacement in
suitable norms obtained in the previous section, are considered as the constitu-
tional steps to accomplish our tasks. We will report the sufficient and necessary
conditions for the convergence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to the continu-
ous problems, and the approximation rates for each case.

As usual, the convergence analysis for eigenvalue problem is performed in two
steps: first we show that the discrete eigenmodes are actually converging without
spurious modes, then we estimate the rate of convergence for eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions.

14



4.1. The two-field eigenproblem
The object of this subsection is to provide, for the two-field case, the neces-

sary and sufficient conditions for proving that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of (9) converge to those of (5) with no spurious solutions, and to find an estimate
for the order of convergence. As already discussed, the convergence results stated
in Section 3.1 will be used following the spectral approximation theory with an
analogous notation to that of [9]. However, before proceeding, we want to em-
phasize that the Galerkin formulation of the two-field eigenproblem (5) can be
set into the framework of a standard mixed eigenvalue problem of the first type
according to the classification in [9] and [10] as follows: find a nontrivial u ∈ V
and λ ∈ R such that for some p ∈ Q{

aI(u,v) + bI(v, p) = λ(u,v) ∀v ∈ V ,
bI(u, q) = 0 ∀q ∈ Q,

(38)

where the bilinear forms introduced are given by

aI(u,v) = µ(∇u,∇v),
bI(v, q) = (q,∇ · v).

If Vh ⊂ V and Qh ⊂ Q are the finite element spaces to approximate the solution,
the Galerkin finite element approximation can be written as: find a nontrivial
uh ∈ Vh and λ ∈ R such that for some ph ∈ Qh there holds{

aI(uh,vh) + bI(vh, ph) = λ(uh,vh) ∀vh ∈ Vh,
bI(uh, qh) = 0 ∀qh ∈ Qh.

(39)

The convergence of the eigensolutions to (39) towards those of (38) is analyzed
in [9].

Let us come back to our main task of analyzing the two-field eigenvalue prob-
lem. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions to (19) and (20) allows us to
define the operators T, Th : VT → VT such that for any f ∈ VT , Tf = u and
Thf = uh are the displacement components of the solutions to (19) and (20),
respectively, where VT can be either (H10 (Ω))d or (L2(Ω))d.

It is now clear that Theorem 2 implies the following convergence in norm

‖T − Th‖L(VT ) → 0 as h→ 0

when VT = (H10 (Ω))d. This implies that the eigensolution of the discrete prob-
lem (9) converge to those of (5) with no spurious solutions.

15



Remark 2. The convergence for the choice of VT = (L2(Ω))d can similarly be ob-
tained as a result of the L2-error estimate of the displacement given in Theorem 3
by assuming that the elliptic regularity condition holds with k′′ = 1.

The following theorem derives error estimates for the eigenvalues.

Theorem 7. Let λ be an eigenvalue of problem (6) of multiplicity m. Assume that
the corresponding eigenspace satisfies the following regularity: u ∈ (Hk′′+1(Ω))d
and p ∈ Hk′′(Ω). Then there are exactly m discrete eigenvalues λ1h, . . . λ

Proof. The proof follows from Corollary 9.8 of [9], using the definitions of εI(h)
and k′′.

Next, we make use of Corollary 9.4 of [9] to conclude that if λ is an eigen-
value of (8) with algebraic multiplicity m, and E = E(λ−1)VT is its generalized
eigenspace, where E(λ) is the Riesz spectral projection associated with λ, and if
Eh = Eh(λ

Having arrived at these results, one can now prove the following:

Theorem 8. Let u be a unit eigenfunction solution of (6) associated to the eigen-
value λ of multiplicity m, with p the corresponding pressure, and let φ1h, . . . ,φ

m

such that

Moreover, under the assumption of Theorem 3,

,

when finite element interpolations of order at least one are used.

16



4.2. The three-field eigenproblem
We first remark that it is possible to obtain a standard mixed formulation for

the three-field eigenproblem (11) as follows (see also [18]): find u ∈ V and λ ∈ R
such that for some [σ, p] ∈ T ×Q there holds{

aII([σ, p], [τ , q]) + bII([τ , q],u) = 0 ∀[τ , q] ∈ T ×Q,
bII([σ, p],v) = −λ(u,v) ∀v ∈ V ,

(40)

where we have introduced the following bilinear forms:

aII([σ, p], [τ , q]) =
1

2µ
(σ, τ ),

bII([σ, p],v) = −(τ − qI,∇Su).

As before, once the finite element spaces Vh ⊂ V , Qh ⊂ Q and Th ⊂ T have
been constructed, the discrete eigenvalue problem can be written as follows: find
uh ∈ Vh and λ ∈ R such that for some [σh, ph] ∈ Th ×Qh there holds{

aII([σh, ph], [τ h, qh]) + bII([τ h, qh],uh) = 0 ∀[τ h, qh] ∈ Th ×Qh,
bII([σh, ph],vh) = −λh(uh,vh) ∀vh ∈ Vh.

(41)

This is a standard mixed eigenvalue problem of the second type according to the
classification in [9], and can be analyzed by using the abstract theory given there.

Our ultimate purpose in this section is to provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for proving that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of (15) converge to
those of (12) with no spurious solutions, and to estimate the order of convergence.
Thus, we now proceed to establish the convergence results based on Section 3.2, as
before following the notation and the ingredients of [9]. From the well posedness
of problems (30) and (31), for any f ∈ VT , we can define the operators Z,Zh :
VT → VT such that Zf = u and Zhf = uh are the displacement components of

the solutions to (30) and (31), respectively. In this way, Theorem 5 allows us to
state the convergence

‖Z − Zh‖L(VT ) → 0 as h→ 0,

for VT = (H1(Ω))d, which is equivalent to the convergence of eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions we are seeking.

The following theorem provides the rate of convergence of the eigenvalues:

17



Theorem 9. Let λ be an eigenvalue of problem (12) of multiplicitym. Assume that
the corresponding eigenspace satisfies the following regularity: u ∈ (Hk′′+1(Ω))d,
p ∈ Hk′′(Ω), and σ ∈ (Hk′′(Ω))d×dsym . Then there are exactly m discrete eigenval-
ues λ1h, . . . λ

Proof. The proof follows from Corollary 9.8 of [9], using the definitions of εII(h)

Remark 3. The convergence for the choice of VT = (L2(Ω))d can similarly be ob-
tained as a result of the L2-error estimate of the displacement given in Theorem 6
by assuming that the elliptic regularity condition holds with k′′ = 1.

Next, we make use of Corollary 9.4 of [9] to conclude that if λ is an eigen-
value of (12) with algebraic multiplicity m, E = E(λ−1)VT is its generalized
eigenspace, where E(λ) is the Riesz spectral projection associated with λ, and if
Eh = Eh(λ

−1)VT , then

δ̂(E,Eh) . sup

‖u‖VT =1

From these results we can conclude exactly the same as in Theorem 8:

eigenvalue λ of multiplicity m, with p the corresponding pressure and σ the cor-
responding stress, and let φ1h, . . . ,φ

‖u‖2 + µ−1‖p‖1 + µ−1‖σ‖1

when finite element interpolations of order at least one are used.

5. Numerical results

In this section we present some numerical tests to illustrate the theoretical
convergence results obtained for the two-field and three-field Stokes problems in
two dimensions. Two different problem domains, namely, a square domain and
an L-shaped domain are considered in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. The
orthogonal subscale stabilization method is applied with equal order of P1 (linear)
and P2 (quadratic) interpolations for all the unknowns on triangular elements.

It is important to note that all the theory about stabilized finite element meth-
ods applies for some fixed values of the constants defined in these parameters. The
accuracy of the approximation for a fixed mesh size depends on the discretization
type of the region as well as on the choice of the algebraic constants in the stabi-
lization parameters.

In the present study, the method given in (9) is applied using fixed values of
the constants, that we have chosen as c1 = 1/4 and c2 = 1/10 for both P1 and
P2 elements to solve the two-field eigenproblem (5). For the three-field Stokes
eigenvalue problem (11), we employ the method given in (15), where the constants
of the stabilization parameters are now taken as c3 = 1, c4 = 1/10 and c5 = 1/4.

The case µ = 1 is considered for all the tests we examine, and as the ex-
act solutions to the considered eigenproblems are unknown, reference values are
taken from the works published for validation purposes. The reference values are
given individually for each test case. We examine the convergence rates for the
reference eigenvalue approximations in terms of the difference between the ap-
proximate value and the reference value, normalized by the latter. For each test
case, we illustrate the results on a log-log scaled plane.

In the simulations, the displacement (or velocity) components are taken as
zero on the whole boundary, whereas the pressure is specified to be zero at a
single point of the computational domain. The computations are carried out by
a code written by us using MATLAB, where the generalized eigenvalue function
eigs, which uses ARPACK, is involved. The number of divisions in each direction
is denoted by N . For the L-shaped domain, N is the number of division in one of
the shortest edges.

5.1. Test 1: Square domain
In this test, we consider a widely used experiment, and solve the eigenprob-

lems on the square Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. A sample discretization of the problem
domain using N = 5 is illustrated in Figure 1. As we have already mentioned,

Figures 2 and 3 present the convergence of the minimum eigenvalue approx-
imations to the reference value λ1 for the two-field and three-field problems, re-
spectively. From the two figures, we can observe the optimal convergence rates,
which are 2 for P1 elements and 4 for P2 elements for both approximations.
These calculations prove numerically that the theoretical convergence results are
achieved. To have a closer glance at the computed eigenvalues, the approximation
to the first eigenvalue as well as the error values are listed in Tables 1-3 (using P1
elements) and Tables 2-4 (using P2 elements). It can be seen from these tables

and thus as h tends to zero accordingly, the computed eigenvalues converge to
the reference value. Moreover, the results show a monotonic convergence of the
approximations from above.

case are shown in Table 7 (using P1 elements) and Table 8 (using P2 elements).
The numerical results show that the approximations for all the first ten eigenvalues
in the calculated spectrum converge to the corresponding reference solutions, and
the approximated values are above the reference solutions for all cases.

In order to compare our results qualitatively, we plot the unknowns, when
N = 40 using P1 elements in Figure 4 for the two-field case, and in Figure 5 for
the three-field case. Comparing these two figures, one can see the perfect agree-
ment in the velocity and pressure profiles obtained with the two formulations.
Moreover, we can observe that the behavior of the velocity streamlines and pres-
sure levels are in good agreement with the previously published results [2, 19].

Before proceeding, we want to report an unexpected behavior we have en-

countered during our numerical experiments. As the numerical analysis for both
two-field and three-field source problems suggests, the numerical constants in the
stabilization parameters can be arbitrarily chosen in a wide range. Considering
the source problems, for all cases this conclusion has been validated by testing

25



different combinations of the parameters chosen from a very large interval. For
the eigenvalue problems, this is also true for the two-field case. However, consid-
ering the approximation of first ten eigenvalues for the three-field eigenproblem,
when we test the method with constants approximately ten times larger than our
default values, we have observed that for certain cases spurious node-to-node os-
cillations in the approximations are developed. This bad behavior only exists in
the seventh and tenth modes, and only for the three-field case for both P1 and P2
elements, using high values for the algorithmic constants. In other words, the cor-
rect values are well approximated for larger values of the stabilization constants
for the two-field problem; however, a bad behavior is observed in two approxima-
tions of the first ten eigenvalues for the three-field case. These results lead us to
think that a possible reason for this issue could be related to the deficiency of the
algorithm that computes the eigenvalues for the structure of the resulting system
in the three-field case.

It is known that the analysis of the Galerkin method relies on the inf-sup con-
dition, and ours on the stabilization terms to get stability and convergence for
the source problem, and all the analysis of the eigenvalue problem is based on
the results for the source problem. Just to try, we have run this example with
N = 20 switching off the stabilization terms. Once the spurious modes have been
suppressed, for structured meshes the eigenvalues seem to convergence, with the
velocity eigenfunctions slightly oscillatory. For unstructured meshes, there is no
convergence of the eigenvalues. Results are also quite sensitive to the calculation
procedure, showing the instability of the system.

5.2. Test 2: L-shaped domain
In the previous example we have considered a convex domain and showed that

the convergence estimates are recovered numerically for both two-field and three-
field cases. Next, we want to examine a test case with an L-shaped domain with
a re-entrant corner, defined by Ω = [−1, 1]2 \ [0, 1]2. The problem domain with a
discretization where N = 5 is shown in Figure 6.

For this experiment, we consider λ2 = 48.9844 as the reference value to the
fourth eigenvalue. It is known that the dual problem has H ι+1 regularity where
0 < ι < 1 [4]. The convergence results obtained for the two-field problem are
shown in Figure 7, where the reference values are given in Table 9 and 10 using
P1 and P2 elements, respectively. Similarly, Figure 8 plots the convergence re-
sults for the three-field case, whereas the approximated values are listed in Table
11 (P1 results) and Table 12 (P2 results). We conclude from these results that
the method achieves a double order of convergence from above, for the errors of

reported in [4].

6. Conclusions

The stabilized finite element formulation based on the application of subgrid
scale concept to the two-field and three-field Stokes eigenvalue problems has been
presented. The virtue of the method relies in considering the subscales orthogonal
to the finite element space; the fact that the orthogonal projection of the displace-
ments (or velocities) vanishes provides an essential property which makes the

optimally convergent for a given set of algorithmic parameters on which the meth-
ods depend. The numerical computations show that the accuracy of the method is
the one expected from the convergence analysis, and the theoretical convergence
rates for all the experiments considered are exactly achieved in the numerical re-
sults presented.
