Method in soil mechanics problems

Llúıs Monforte Josep Maria Carbonell Marcos Arroyo Antonio Gens

Abstract

This paper presents a computational framework for the numerical analysis of fluid-saturated porous
media at large strains. The proposal relies, on one hand, on the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM),
known for its capability to tackle large deformations and rapid changing boundaries, and, on the other
hand, on constitutive descriptions well-established in current geotechnical analyses (Darcy’s law; Modified
Cam Clay; Houlsby hyper-elasticity). An important feature of this kind of problem is that incompressibil-
ity may arise either from undrained conditions or as a consequence of material behavior; incompressibility
may lead to volumetric locking of the low-order elements that are typically used in PFEM. In this work,
two different three-field mixed formulations for the coupled hydro-mechanical problem are presented, in
which either the effective pressure or the Jacobian are considered as nodal variables, in addition to the
solid skeleton displacement and water pressure. Additionally, several mixed formulations are described
for the simplified single-phase problem due to its formal similitude to the poromechanical case and its
relevance in geotechnics, since it may approximate the saturated soil behavior under undrained condi-
tions. In order to use equal order interpolants in displacements and scalar fields, stabilization techniques
are used in the mass conservation equation of the biphasic medium and in the rest of scalar equations.
Finally, all mixed formulations are assessed in some benchmark problems and their performances are
compared. It is found that mixed formulations that have the Jacobian as a nodal variable perform
better.

1 Introduction

The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is a numerical method well suited for mechanical problems
involving large displacements, large deformations, intermittent separation and/or fusion of bodies. Soft
porous materials such as soils suffer these kinds of mechanical transformations during many activities of
engineering interest. Relevant examples for the case of soils include probing, sampling, pile installation,
excavation and ploughing.

It is well known that PFEM originated to address problems of fluid mechanics [20], including those of fluid
interaction with rigid bodies. Later it was extended to deformable single-phase solids [19]. Subsequently,
several PFEM extensions have addressed geomaterials: Carbonell et al [10] used PFEM to simulate ground
excavation problems. Flow-like landslides have been also studied using PFEM, but considering a single-
phase material description. In Zhang et al [40] a rigid plastic constitutive response was assumed for the soil.
Salazar et al [30] used a non-Newtonian modified Bingham law. Larese et al [15] presented a strategy to
simulate the free surface flow over and throughout a rockfill.

For many porous materials, and particularly for water saturated soils, most observed mechanical responses
cannot be explained without considering the fluid filling its pores. The appropriate general framework is
that of poromechanics in which the continuum is considered to be composed of two phases (solid skeleton
and water) whose interaction is expressed in appropriately formulated linear momentum and mass balance
conservation laws. Extending PFEM to deal with poromechanics-based hydromechanical coupling seems
then a necessary step to make the method relevant to a large class of soil mechanics problems.

There are two extreme situations for hydromechanical coupling [24]. The first one corresponds to freely
drained conditions. In this case, there is no change in the fluid pore pressure and changes in total and effective
stress coincide. The second situation corresponds to fully undrained conditions: there is no relative motion
between water and soil skeleton and the mixture behaves like an incompressible material. These extreme
situations may be dealt with using simpler single-phase formulations. For instance, for undrained conditions,
elasto-plastic formulations using a quasi-incompressible elastic model alongside an isochoric plastic law are
applicable [17].

Simpler models have several advantages, amongst them faster computation, but their field of applicability
is limited to purely drained or undrained situations. A fully coupled formulation is required to address the
full range of potential geotechnical problems. Naturally, a fully coupled formulation should have both free
draining and undrained behaviour as limiting cases.

Undrained conditions in water-saturated soils result in quasi-incompressible behavior. This causes a
well-known numerical problem when using the Finite Element method: volumetric locking of low-order finite
elements. Volumetric locking introduces numerical stiffening and spurious high spatial variability in the
solution, eventually leading to numerical instability. The reason behind this behaviour is the failure to
satisfy the Babuska-Brezzy conditions [2, 8] or the equivalent inf-sup condition [3] due to an improper finite-
dimensional space in the finite element discretization. To avoid this problem two strategies are common:
either to use more complex, but stable, finite elements [38, 26], or to apply stabilization procedures to
originally unstable finite elements [23, 39, 21]. In the later approach, locking is mitigated at the cost of
using a mixed formulation, thereby introducing extra degrees of freedom per node with respect to the primal
formulation. Incompressibility may also arise under general drainage conditions in constitutive models of
materials that predict zero volume change. This is the case, for instance, when failure is reached in Critical
State soil models.

Addressing volumetric locking is thus necessary either in the fully coupled hydromechanical formulation
or in the single-phase undrained approximation. The option adopted here to deal with this problem is the
use of mixed formulations solved with low-order stabilized elements. This option has several advantages.
First, in most cases it offers equal performance at lower computational cost than the use of higher order
elements. Secondly, as pointed by Sun et al [36, 37], it is better adapted to cases were incompressibility
may result from the mechanical behavior of the solid phase itself. Finally, it is easily adaptable to both the
coupled hydromechanical and single-phase undrained formulations, taking advantage of their similar formal
structure.

There are several possible mixed stabilized formulations which are relevant for these problems [22, 23].
In this work alternative mixed stabilized formulations both for total stress and for coupled hydromechanical
analyses at large strains are explored. In the total stress case, only the linear momentum balance equation
is solved with a nearly incompressible elastic model and an isochoric plastic law. In the coupled hydrome-
chanical case, the system of equations of linear momentum and mass balance equations is solved using a
monolithic approach whereas the solid skeleton follows a critical state plasticity model. Thus, volumetric
locking caused either by incompressibility at nearly undrained conditions or by incompressibility of the solid
skeleton are both dealt with.

The paper is structured as follows: first, the basics of the Particle Finite element method, are presented.
Then, the balance equations for the mechanical problem and the hydromechanical problem are described in
its primal and mixed form including the stabilization terms. After briefly reviewing the constitutive relations,
the comparative performance of the different formulations implemented is explored via benchmark problems:
first for the single-phase mechanical problem, and then for the hydromechanical problem. Finally, a number
of conclusions are drawn.

2 Fundamentals of PFEM for soil mechanics

In PFEM the continuum is modelled using an Updated Lagrangian formulation; that is, a Lagrangian descrip-
tion of the motion is used and all variables are referred to the last known configuration. A mesh discretization
of the domain must be generated in order to solve the governing equations in the standard FEM fashion.

2



Nodes in that mesh are treated as material particles whose motion is tracked during the solution.
The quality of the numerical solution depends on the discretization chosen. The original idea of the

PFEM was to improve the mesh quality by performing a re-triangulation of the domain only when needed.
Usually that is performed according to some criteria associated with element distortion. Mesh distortion is
corrected and improved naturally with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), because re-triangulation
is based on Delaunay tessellations that maximize the minimum angle of all the triangles in the tessellation.
Therefore, thin, stretched elements are avoided while still capturing large changes in the continuum domain
without global remeshing and mesh to mesh interpolation. The process can be easily extended to 3D using
tetrahedral elements.

Additionally, h-adaptive techniques are employed to obtain a better discretization of the domain. New
particles are introduced in areas where large gradients in the flow variables are detected or where a high
plastic dissipation is generated. These zones must be refined because the number of particles may become
too low to obtain an accurate solution. On the contrary, due to high shear deformations, particles may
locally concentrate in the same region of the domain. To overcome this difficulty particles that are closer
than a characteristic distance are removed.

Conforming meshes are used to preserve mass in the remeshing process: the boundary of the domain
remains unchanged so the volume of the discretization does not vary. The mass of the domain also depends on
the density and thus on the transfer process of Gauss point variables. This, however, is relatively unimportant
for soil applications, since highest mesh distortion is usually associated with shearing and the attainment of
incompressible critical state conditions.

Although it is not strictly necessary (see [40]), low order finite elements are typically used in PFEM:
linear triangles in two-dimensional models and linear tetrahedron in three dimensions. Linear interpolated
elements have several advantages due to their simplicity: particles usually define exclusively the mesh nodes
and no extra interpolations are needed after remeshing. Also, as already pointed out, the computational
cost is lower compared to high-order elements. A relative drawback is that stabilized mixed formulations are
required instead.

The interpolation of state variables plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the results. When new particles
are inserted in the domain, flow variables are linearly interpolated from those of the previous mesh element.
To avoid excessive smoothing of internal variables, information is transferred from the previous Gauss points
to the new ones. In this work, a nearest interpolation procedure is used; hence, new integration points inherit
the information of the closest Gauss point of the previous mesh. This strategy ensures that information is
not altered in the elements that do not change during the meshing process. Clearly, other interpolation
strategies are possible, see for instance [25]. Extended details about remeshing and interpolation in PFEM
applications for solid mechanics can be found in [28, 9].

A typical solution algorithm of PFEM is conceptually illustrated in Figure 1 for a general case of fragmen-
tation and deformation of a solid mass under the action of an external object; (note, however, that fracture
is not considered in this work). For clarity purposes we will define the collection or cloud of nodes (C) be-
longing to the analysis domain, the volume (V) defining the analysis domain and the mesh (M) discretizing
the domain. The simulation involves the following steps:

1. Begin the computation of each time step with a cloud of points defining the analysis domain. For
instance Cn denotes the cloud at time t = tn, see Figure 1.

2. Identify the boundaries defining the analysis domain Vn. This is an essential step as some boundaries
may be severely distorted during the solution and, conceptually, may include separation and re-entering
of nodes. The domain boundary may be identified with the α−shape method [12] or that of the previous
step, using conforming meshes.

3. Discretize the continuum domains with a finite element (FE) mesh Mn.

4. Solve the Lagrangian equations of motion in the domain. Compute the state variables at the next (up-
dated) configuration for t+ ∆t: displacements, pressure, water-pressure, strains, stresses and internal
variables, etc.

fragmented the action of an external rigid footing using the PFEM. In the boundaries the particles are fixed.

5. Move the mesh nodes to a new position Cn+1 where n + 1 denotes the time tn + ∆t, in terms of the
time increment size. This step is typically a consequence of the solution process of step 4.

6. Go back to step 1 and repeat the solution process for the next time step to obtain Cn+2. The process
is shown in Figure 1.

3 Multiple field mixed formulations in finite strains

This section presents the balance equations relevant for the two cases of single-phase continuous media and
fluid-saturated porous media. The governing equations are presented both in their primal form and then
using mixed forms. After describing the stabilization procedures, the stabilized Galerkin expressions of the
formulations are presented.

3.1 Single-phase mechanical media

A quasi-static linear momentum displacement-based finite element formulation in updated Lagrangian form
(i.e. expressing all quantities and their derivatives in the deformed configuration), valid for two- and three-
dimensional conditions may be written as:

4





∇ · σσσ + b = 000 in Ωt × (0, T )
uuu(XXX, t = 0) = uuu0 in Ω0

uuu(XXX, t) = uuu in Γu × (0, T )
nnn · σσσ = ttt in Γt × (0, T )

(1)

where σσσ = σ̂σσ(FFF , V ) is the Cauchy stress tensor, σ̂σσ stands for the appropriate constitutive equation for path
dependent materials (large strains elasto-plastic constitutive equations based on the multiplicative split [33]
are used here, see Section 4), FFF is the total deformation gradient and V represents the set of internal variables
of the model. u0 stands for the initial displacement, b is the external body force vector and ∂Ωt = Γu ∪ Γt
(Γu ∩ Γt = ∅) defines the boundary of the domain where displacements uuu and tractions ttt are prescribed.

The same problem may be restated using a mixed two-field displacement-pressure (u − p) formulation.
Introducing a volumetric/deviatoric decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor, the standard expression of
the strong form of the equilibrium equation becomes



∇ · (dev(σσσ) + p1) + b = 000 in Ωt × (0, T )
p− ( 1

3
1 : σσσ) = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )

uuu(XXX, t = 0) = uuu0 in Ω0

uuu(XXX, t) = uuu in Γu × (0, T )
nnn · (dev(σσσ) + p1) = ttt in Γt × (0, T )

(2)

where dev(σσσ) is the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor, p is the Cauchy pressure and 1 stands for
the second order identity tensor.

A three-field displacement-Jacobian-pressure (u − θ − p) finite element mixed formulation of the same
problem is also possible [41], where the volume in the current configuration per unit volume in the reference
state, θ, is introduced in addition to displacements and pressure. Then, the mixed strong form of the
equilibrium is now given by

where J = det(F) is the determinant of the deformation gradient, θ is the volumetric deformation and

σ̆σσ = σ̂σσ(F̆FF , V ) is the Cauchy stress evaluated with the assumed deformation gradient F̆. For this formulation,
the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the Cauchy stress tensor as:

σ̆σσ =
1

θ
F̆FF · S̆SS · F̆FF

(4)

The assumed deformation gradient is defined as:

F̆ = FvFd = (θ

3 )(det(F)

− 1
3F) =

(
θ

det(F)

) 1
3

F (5)

That is, the deviatoric part of the deformation gradient, Fd, is preserved whereas the volumetric part,
Fv, is replaced with the θ variable. Note that in this formulation the Cauchy stress tensor depends on both,

5



displacements and on the Jacobian. Despite that, the usual form of strain-driven stress integration schemes
are completely suitable for this formulation.

In plane strain conditions, the assumed deformation gradient, Equation (5), has to be redefined in order
to guarantee that the out of plane component of the deformation is equal to unity [35]:

F̆2D =

(
θ

det(F)

) 1
2

F2D (6)

Then, the three dimensional constitutive law is evaluated with:

F̆CL =

(
F̆2D ~0T

~0 1

)
(7)

The previous formulation adds two extra balance equations with respect to the displacement-based for-
mulation. As it will be shown in Section 3.1.2, where the discrete Finite Element equations are presented,
this fact results in the addition of two degrees of freedom per node (θ and p) with respect to the primal
formulation. It becomes unclear which of the two extra equations may be then responsible for any improve-
ment on the volumetric locking effect. To clarify this point, a third mixed formulation, having only the
displacement u and the volume deformation θ as independent variables (the u− θ formulation), will also be
assessed: 



∇ · σ̆σσ + b = 000 in Ωt × (0, T )
J − θ = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )
uuu(XXX, t = 0) = uuu0 in Ω0

uuu(XXX, t) = uuu in Γu × (0, T )
nnn · σ̆σσ = ttt in Γt × (0, T )

(8)

3.1.1 Weak form

The weak form of the formulations are obtained as usual, multiplying the strong form of the balance equations
for test functions and integrating over the entire domain. To show the expression in the most complex case,
the weak form of Equation (3) is written as:

δlkδij is the deviatoric projection tensor. Being η ∈ V, ζ ∈ G and q ∈ Q valued

functions in the space of virtual displacements V, virtual volume Jacobians G, and virtual pressures Q,
respectively.

3.1.2 Finite element discrete equations

In order to obtain the finite element discrete equations of the weak form of the mixed formulations, first the
nodal variables are approximated with the FE shape functions


uh = Nu · ũ
θh = N · θ̃θθ
ph = N · p̃

(10)

6



where uh, θh and ph are finite element approximations of displacement, the Jacobian and the pressure
whereas ũ, θ̃θθ and p̃ are the nodal values. The same order interpolation functions are used for scalar fields
and displacements: N = [N1, N2, ..., Nn] and Nu = [N11, N21, ..., Nn1] where n is the number of nodes.

The matrix form of the Galerkin expression of the u − θ − p formulation, Equation (3), is obtained
introducing the previous approximations to the weak form, Equation (9):

where B has the same form that the small deformation strain-displacement matrix [41] and s corresponds to
the Voigt notation of tensor s. The expressions of the tangent matrices for the finite deformation hyper-elastic
problem can be found in [41].

3.1.3 Stabilization of the mechanical problem

In our approach, linear shape functions are used for all the variables of the mixed formulations. The stabi-
lization method used is the so-called Polynomial Pressure Projection (PPP) previously applied to stabilize
Stokes equations [4, 11]. The PPP has two main ingredients:

1. A mixed equal order interpolation of the scalar and vector fields.

2. A L2 projection of the scalar variables (volume or pressure variables).

The method is obtained by modifying the mixed variational equation (i.e. the pressure continuity equa-
tion) by using local L2 polynomial pressure projections of the pressure variable. The application of the
projections in conjunction with minimization of the problem field mismatch, eliminates the inconsistency of
equal-order approximations and leads to a stable variational formulation. Unlike other stabilization meth-
ods, the Polynomial Pressure Projection does not require specification of a mesh dependent stabilization
parameter or calculation of higher-order derivatives. It uses a projection on a discontinuous space and,
as a consequence, can be implemented at element level avoiding the need of mesh or problem dependent
parameters. The implementation of this stabilization scheme reduces to a simple modification of the weak
continuity equation (the incompressibility constraint).

Given a function p ∈ L2, the L2 projection operator p̆ : L2 → Q0 is defined by

7



∫
Ω0

q̆ (p− p̆) dΩ0 = 0 ∀q̆ ∈ Q0 (18)

where p̆ is the best approximation of the pressure p in the space of polynomials of order O(Q0).
To stabilize the mixed forms given by Equations (2), (3) and (8) we add at each element the projection

operator to the scalar continuity equations.∫
Ωe0

(q − q̆)
αs
µ

(p− p̆) dΩ0 = 0 (19)

where αs is the stabilization parameter and µ is the material shear modulus.
Then, the discrete and stabilized finite element equations of the u− θ−p formulation, Equations (3) and

(11), are written as: 


On the other hand, the discrete stabilized equation of the u− θ formulation, Equation (8), is expressed

as 

P(σ̆σσ) = fext

(M +

And finally, the equations of the u− p formulation, Equation (2), read

3.2 Fluid-saturated multiple phase porous media

The balance of mass and linear momentum equations for multiple-phase deformable porous media using
a displacement-water pressure (u − pw) formulation in quasi-static cases, may be written in the current
deformed configuration as: 

uuu(XXX, t) = uuu in Γu × (0, T )
nnn · σσσ = ttt in Γt × (0, T )
pw(XXX, t) = pw in Γpw × (0, T )
−nnn · vvvd = g in Γg × (0, T )

(24)

8



where pw is the Cauchy water pressure, (ṗw =
dpw
dt

) is the material time derivative with respect to the solid
phase, κw is the water compressibility and v

d is the Darcy’s velocity. The boundary of the domain is divided
in two parts, ∂Ωt = Γpw ∪Γg (Γpw ∩Γg = ∅), where fixed water pressure pw and prescribed water flow g are
imposed. The interested reader is referred to [5, 16, 36] for further information.

According to the principle of effective stress, the total stress tensor, σσσ, is equal to the sum of the pore
pressure, pw, and the effective stress, σσσ

′:

σσσ = σσσ′ + pw1 (25)

and the effective stress, which only depends on the strains of the solid skeleton, is defined as

σσσ′ = σ̂σσ
′
(FFF , V ) = dev(σσσ′) + p′1 (26)

Two different mixed formulations for the coupled poromechanics problem are explored for use in PFEM.
The first one is the displacement-effective pressure-water pressure, which is expressed in the strong form as
follows: 


∇ · (dev(σσσ) + p′1 + pw1) + b = 000 in Ωt × (0, T )
p′ − ( 1

1 : σσσ′) = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )

−1
κw

ṗw +∇ · v +∇ · vd = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )
(27)

The second mixed-formulation explored is a displacement-Jacobian-water pressure formulation given by:

∇ · (σ̆σσ′ + pw1) + b = 000 in Ωt × (0, T )
J − θ = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )
−1
κw

ṗw +∇ · v +∇ · vd = 0 in Ωt × (0, T )
(28)

In both formulations (Equations (27) and (28)), the appropriate initial and boundary conditions are
considered.

For completeness a displacement-Jacobian-effective pressure-water pressure (u− θ− p′− pw) formulation
could have been also eventually tested. This has not been done, since, as shown below, results for the
single-phase media indicated that the extra degree of freedom added in the more complex formulation did
not achieve any relevant improvement in the solution with respect to simpler mixed formulations.

3.2.1 Finite element discrete equations

After obtaining the weak form of the problem, the semi-discrete equations of the primal formulation, Equa-
tion (24), are given by: 

3.2.2 Stabilization of the mass conservation equation

The monolithic approach of the hydromechanical problem, Equation (29), fails to satisfy the inf-sup condition
in the undrained limit if equal order interpolants are used for both displacement and water pressure [22].
Several techniques have been developed to address this problem introducing a characteristic stabilization
parameter which depends on the element size and/or material properties, see [23]. The fluid pressure
Laplacian stabilization (FPL) technique is used in this work because of its good solution accuracy and of
the symmetry of the resulting system.

Using FPL-stabilization, a term is added to the weak form of the mass balance equation of the hydrome-
chanical problem: ∫

dΩt = 0 ∀q ∈ Q (33)

where kp is the permeability tensor and τ is the stabilization parameter. The expression chosen for the τ is
the one proposed by Preisig et al. in [23].

Then, the stabilized semi-discrete equations of the primal formulation, Equation (24), are given by

As before PPP stabilization of the scalar balance equation is applied in the u− p′ − pw and u− θ − pw
formulations. In addition, the mass balance equation is also stabilized in all cases, using the procedure that
is described above.

These equations are solved with a monolithic approach and an implicit time integration scheme is used.

4 Constitutive relations

In this work, large strains elasto-plastic constitutive equations are employed [33]. These models are formu-
lated using a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part. To this end,
an intermediate configuration of irreversible (plastic) deformations is introduced, relative to which the elastic
response of the material is characterized. As a consequence, the deformation gradient is decomposed as:

FFF = FFF e ·FFF p (39)
In formulations that consider the Jacobian as a nodal variable, the assumed deformation gradient also

splits multiplicatively in a plastic and elastic part, F̆FF = F̆FF
e
· F̆FF

p
. In these formulations, as mentioned before,

the local problem retains a strain-driven format. Therefore, the same procedures and constitutive relations
as the displacement-based finite element are used. However, in these cases, a different definition of the
deformation is employed. The rest of the equations defining the local problem can be found in [32].

Two types of constitutive relations are used, one for the purely mechanical problem (total-stress analysis)
and another one for the coupled hydro-mechanical problem. For the so-called total stress analysis, the
saturated soil is assumed to satisfy a Tresca yield criterion:

f(τττ) = J2 cos(θL)− Su (40)
where τττ = Jσσσ is the Kirchhoff stress tensor, J2 is the second invariant of the Kirchhoff stress, θL is the Lode
Angle and Su is the undrained shear strength, a characteristic parameter of the soil. The sharp edges of
the yield surface are smoothed with a C2 approximation [1]. The elastic regime is assumed to fulfil a linear
model between the Kirchhoff stress and the elastic Hencky Strain:

τττ = Jp1+ dev(τττ) = K�ev1+ 2G���
e
d (41)

where ���e = ln(bbbe)/2 is the elastic Hencky Strain and bbbe = FFF e ·FFF eT the elastic left Cauchy-Green tensor.
�ev = 1 : ���

e = ln(Je) and ���ed = I
d : ���e = ln(bbb

e
)/2 are the volumetric and the deviatoric part of the elastic

Hencky strain, respectively, and bbb
e

= Je−2/3bbb
e

is the deviatoric part of the elastic Left Cauchy Green tensor.
K and G are the bulk and shear modulus of the material.

For the coupled hydro-mechanical analysis, a Modified Cam Clay model is used [6, 29]. The elastic part
of the model follows an hyperelastic model proposed by Houlsby [13]; then, the volumetric and deviatoric
part of the effective Kirchhoff stress, τττ ′ = π′1+ τττd, are computed according to:

, λ is the slope of the virgin
consolidation line and the reference preconsolidation pressure is denoted by pc0.

In both models associated plasticity is assumed. The integration of the elasto-plastic constitutive relations
is performed with an explicit scheme with adaptive sub-stepping; correction for the yield surface drift is
applied [18, 34].

A large deformation generalization of the Darcy’s Law, excluding inertial effects is used:

vd = kp · (∇pw + ρwg) (45)

where kp =

g ρw

description of the permeability tensor is assumed to be constant [16].

5 Numerical examples

In this section, a set of examples of increasing numerical complexity are employed to assess the performance
of the different mixed formulations presented above in PFEM. An effort is made to separate effects due to the
specific choice of mixed formulation from issues that are related to other aspects of PFEM. The first example
involves on the indentation of a rigid-strip footing into a single-phase incompressible material (representing
an undrained soil). In the second example, a flexible circular footing resting in a Modified Cam Clay soil
is used to assess the two-phase formulations; a wide range of loading conditions -ranging from drained to
undrained- are used. Finally, the method is applied to the modelling of a more challenging geo-mechanical
problem: a Cone Penetration Test with pore pressure measurement (CPTu).

5.1 Rigid footing resting on a one-phase deformable media

In this example, a rough rigid strip footing is pushed into a weightless Tresca soil. Footing displacement is
imposed using Dirichlet boundary conditions. Due to the symmetry of the problem, only half of the problem
is computed. The geometry of the domain (initial and final mesh) is depicted in Figure 2. Geometry
and constitutive parameters (E = 100 kPa, ν = 0.495 and Su = 1 kPa; resulting in a rigidity index,
Ir = G/Su, of 33), are identical to those used by [14]. These authors analyzed this problem using an ALE
(Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) method, investigating the effect of different high-order elements on the
primal formulation.

Figure 3 presents curves of normalized settlement vs normalized soil resistance for the three stabilized
formulations. The normalized limit resistance provides a bearing capacity factor for this problem, Nc = q/Su,
where q is the vertical stress applied by the footing and Su the strength of the soil. A reference solution
from [14] (obtained with 21-noded elements) is also included for comparison purposes.

It is clear that all the solutions obtained with stabilized formulations match the reference solution. The
oscillations in these curves result from errors introduced at remeshing events and are independent of the
mixed formulation employed. Indeed, the sudden drops in resistance are related to the size of the elements
close to the rigid footing. With the mesh adaptive procedures of PFEM nodes initially belonging to the
contour of the domain are kept at the contour and its position is never modified. However, to maintain
accuracy, new nodes may be inserted when the distance between two adjacent nodes at the contour becomes
to large, or a node may be deleted when it comes too close to another node. In this problem, the last
node with prescribed displacements (representing the footing corner) and the first node without restrictions
(corresponding to the soil adjacent to the corner) tend to separate. The insertion of a new node in the
middle of this segment causes the periodic drops in the resistance curves.

The effect of the different mixed formulations is more visible in the vertical profiles of stresses presented
in Figure 4(a). Stresses obtained with the u− θ− p and u− θ formulations show smaller scatter than those
resulting from the u − p formulation show more. This is even clearer when the stress invariants alongside
the same vertical are plotted (see Figure 4(b)); the main differences affect the Lode angle, that it is almost

coincident for the two formulations that have the Jacobian as a nodal variable. In contrast, in the formulation
that does not have the Jacobian as a nodal variable, the Lode angle shows a large scatter, particularly on
the upper 2 m, where the plastic region is located. Due to the definition of the yield surface, the scatter in
Lode angle explains also the variations of the second stress invariant (J2) in the same region.

It may be questioned if the stress scatter noticed above is due solely to the choice of mixed formulation.
To clarify this aspect a further analysis has been performed. The geometry and definition of the problem
are the same, but now the soil is considered more rigid (E = 1495 kPa, ν = 0.495, Su = 1 kPa resulting in
Ir = 500), so that failure will be reached at lower displacements. Also, mesh refinement is disabled.

Figure 5 shows the mesh at the end of computations; since displacements are small, the mesh is not
distorted, despite the achievement of a clear limit load (at a footing penetration z/B = 0.02; see Figure
6). As before, the differences in normalized resistance between the formulations are small, with the u − p
formulation indicating a slightly higher (2%) limit load. More importantly perhaps, the vertical profiles
of stress components and invariants, Figure 7, show unequivocally that including the Jacobian as a nodal

variable practically eliminates the scatter on computed Lode angle. Although in this problem such scatter
has not caused significant problems at the global scale, this may not always be the case.

5.2 Flexible circular footing resting on a two-phase deformable media

The various two-phase formulations are examined using a problem that involves a flexible circular footing
loading in a compressible clay. A similar geometry to the previous example is used; however, this case is
axisymmetric and the footing is discretized with a load boundary condition. The model has a 0.25 m thick
layer of elastic material placed on the top of the domain in order to avoid the problems that arise in the
Modified Cam Clay model when the stress state approaches zero effective pressure. This layer of elements is
always discretized using u− pw elements. The initial stress state is obtained using a value of the coefficient
of lateral stress, K0 = 0.5. The problem and the values of the constitutive parameters (Table 1) are similar

to the ones presented in [7]; although they were using plane strain conditions and the initial stress state was
obtained differently.

A vertical load of 100 kPa is applied at a constant rate over a period of time; afterwards, this load is
held constant to allow consolidation. Three different loading times (Tl) are used: 0.001, 10 and 1000 days.
The computational time-step is ∆t = Tl/25.

Figure 8 depicts the vertical displacement at the centerline of the footing as a function of the normalized
time, t/Tl. For the fastest and slowest loading rates displacements cease to increase once the loading phase
ends. Loading at the intermediate rate shows initial stiffness similar to the fast case and final settlement
similar to the slow case. Figure 8 also plots the variation of water pressure at a point located below the
footing center at a depth equal to the footing diameter. For the fastest loading rate, water pressure increases
until the end of the loading phase; then remains constant. At the slowest loading rate no excess of pore
pressure is generated, although a small hydrostatic increase (from 10 kPa at the initial state to 10.30 kPa at
the end of the problem) is computed due to the settlement of the observation point. For the intermediate

loading velocity the water pressure increases initially, attains a maximum at the end of loading and then
decays.

In summary, the response is fully undrained in the fast case, fully drained in the slowest case and shows
some consolidation at the intermediate loading rate. For the three loading rates there is little discrepancy
between the solutions computed with the different formulations. The u − pw formulation predicts slightly
smaller settlements and (at the faster loading rate) smaller pore pressure generation.

5.3 Cone penetration test

The cone penetration test (CPTu) is one of the most widely used in situ geotechnical testing methods.
During the test an instrumented cone is pushed into the ground at a controlled rate. Tip resistance and
sleeve friction are always recorded, and, very frequently, the pore water pressure just behind the cone tip
(u2 position, see Robertson [27]) is also measured. From these measurements, stratigraphy and constitutive
soil parameters are estimated based mostly on empirical correlations.

A CPTu in a Modified Cam Clay soil is performed. The cone is assumed rigid and smooth; contact
between cone and soil is enforced using a Penalty method. Soil parameters are listed in Table 2; these values
and the geometry of the problem try to mimic the case examined by Sheng et al using an ALE method [31].

The soil is weightless and the initial stress state imposed is given by σ′v = −57.5 kPa and σ′h = −28.9
kPa. At the beginning of the computation the cone is wished-in-place with the tip at a depth of 2.8 cone
radii. The cone is advanced downwards at 2 cm/s; a parametric analysis performed by Sheng et al. [31]
indicates that undrained conditions will prevail at that velocity.

Net cone tip resistance, qc, computed adding vertical forces from nodes at the cone tip and subtracting
the initial vertical stress, is represented against normalized penetration in Figure 9. Pore water pressure at
the u2 position -computed interpolating from boundary nodes closer to the cone shoulder point- is shown in

Figure 9(d). Results are presented for the u− pw and for the u− θ− pw formulations (the u− p′ − pw gave
similar results to the latter).

Although the cone resistance shows some scatter, Figure 9(a), a stationary state may be identified after
a penetration of 10 radii. At that stage net cone resistance is approximately 155 kPa for the u − θ − pw
formulation and 170 kPa for the u−pw formulation. In Sheng et al. a value of 150 kPa was obtained although
using a different numerical approach. The u− θ − pw formulation results in a smoother penetration curve.
This smoother response is even clearer on the pore-pressure curve, Figure 9(b), whereas the amplitude of
the pore pressure oscillations is very large for the u− pw formulation.

Figure 10 presents the values of water pressure and volumetric deformation obtained for both formu-
lations at z = 20R. The small volumetric deformations confirm that the analysis is performed in almost
undrained conditions. The water pressure field exhibits large gradients close to the u2 position. This ex-
plains the oscillatory nature of the numerical record but not why the oscillations have smaller amplitude
for the formulation. Indeed the distribution of the water pressure field is similarly smooth in both cases at
the overall domain scale. This is consistent with the fact that both formulations use the FPL stabilization
method in the mass balance equation.

The overall smoothness hides some local differences. In the u− pw formulation some oscillations appear
just below the tip of the cone; in addition, along the shaft of the penetrometer, slightly higher water pressures
are found compared to the other formulation. Also, in the u−θ−pw formulation, marginally higher volumetric
deformations are obtained at the shaft, indicating slightly higher water pressure dissipation.

Local differences are more noticeable when the stress fields are considered. Figure 11 compares the stress
state at the final penetration position for both formulations. Using the u − pw formulation, the effective
mean pressure, the deviatoric stress invariant and the preconsolidation stress, exhibit large oscillations near
to the penetrometer; that is in areas where the soil has undergone large plastic shearing. On the other
hand, when using the u− θ− pw formulation all these stress fields are smoother. This is consistent with the
fact that the momentum equation is also stabilized for this formulation. Stress field oscillations close to the
penetrometer affect also the normal contact stresses along the shaft: a smoother stress profile is obtained
with the u− θ − pw formulation, see Figure 9. These local variations in normal contact stress are the likely
cause behind the observed large amplitude oscillation of the pore pressure record at the u2 position in the
u− pw formulation. The benefits of extended stabilization for this coupled case are therefore evident.

6 Conclusions

A numerical framework, based on PFEM, for the modelling of geomechanical problems at large strains has
been presented. A poromechanical model where the governing equations are the linear momentum and mass
balance of the mixture is employed. The constitutive model is based on well-established soil mechanics
formulations (Cam-Clay with Houlsby hyperelasticity; Darcy’s law). Additionally, to examine a classical
formulation for undrained problems, a single-phase, elasto-plastic Tresca material description has been also
studied.

These two material descriptions have in common a potential for incompressibility that may cause nu-
merical problems if not addressed in the formulation of the problem. The focus of the paper has been the
development of stabilized mixed formulations for low order finite elements.

Three different one-phase mixed formulations for the mechanical problem have been assessed: the u− p,
u−θ−p and u−θ formulations. In all of them Polynomial Pressure Projection (PPP) is applied to stabilize
the scalar field variables. In the case examined (penetration of a rigid strip footing) all the alternatives

appear to perform well at the global response level. However, the formulation u − p, which does not have
the Jacobian as a nodal variable, presents significant spurious oscillations in the value of the Lode Angle.
When the Jacobian is present no particular advantage is obtained from adding also the mean pressure p as
field variable.

Noting that the effective pressure and the specific volume change are here the relevant nodal variables,
analogous mixed formulations -(u−p′−pw) and (u−θ−pw)- were explored for the poromechanical formula-
tion. In addition to the PPP stabilization, a Fluid-Pressure-Laplacian stabilization of the mass conservation
equation was also applied to the primal hydromechanical formulation, u− pw.

The performance of the alternative mixed formulations was similar as in the single-phase case. For the
first example -a flexible circular footing resting on a Modified Cam Clay soil- a very similar global response
was obtained in terms of water pressure and displacements. Significant differences between formulations
arose in the more challenging final example, a CPTu in clay, that involves a contact problem with severe
geometric non-linearities in almost undrained conditions. Using the primal formulation, with only a FPL

mass-stabilization, was not enough to avoid high amplitude oscillations of the excess pore-pressure record at
the -experimentally crucial- cone shoulder position. That was a consequence of oscillations in the stress fields
in regions of large plastic deformations. The use of a Jacobian based mixed formulation (u − θ − pw) with
extra PPP stabilization terms resulted in a significantly improved response. This better behaviour obtained
with the u− θ − pw formulation makes this mixed form the best candidate to face soil mechanics problems
within PFEM.
