Abstract: Lorca earthquake (11-05-2011) is most destructive event recorded in Spain, causing nine fatalities 
and other severe consequences. Its important intensity was rather unexpected, and serious concern arose 
regarding risk of building stock in Spain. This paper analyzes performance, under Lorca earthquake, of RC 
buildings with one-way slabs with wide beams. This construction type is chosen for its high vulnerability and 
for being vastly widespread in Spain. This study is conducted on 3 and 6-story prototype representative 
buildings. These buildings are designed for three major seismic zones in Spain: low seismicity, moderate 
seismicity (as Lorca) and medium seismicity (as Granada). Seismic performance under Lorca earthquake is 
numerically investigated through nonlinear time-history analyses. Results show that buildings designed 
without any seismic provision (i.e. those in low seismicity zones) do not survive Lorca record, even with 
cooperation of masonry infill walls. Buildings with seismic design (i.e. those in Lorca and Granada zones) can 
survive Lorca earthquake only with collaboration of infill walls. To raise reliability of these conclusions, a 
sensitivity analysis to most influencing parameters is conducted.  
 
Keywords: Collapse, Lorca earthquake, seismic vulnerability, time history, wide beams. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In Spain, there are several common building types that are vulnerable to earthquakes, even in most 
seismic-prone regions. This situation can be attributed to a number of reasons: unawareness of 
actual seismic hazard, lenient prescriptions of design codes, and, in some occasions, lack of 
fulfillment of regulations and poor construction practices. Lorca earthquake (11-05-2011, Mw = 5.1) 
stressed gravity of situation, given that its high intensity was rather unexpected and many buildings 
were seriously damaged. Additionally, recent Ossa de Montiel earthquake (23-02-2015, Mw = 5.2) 
[IGME 2015] occurred in a supposedly non-seismic location; this event has confirmed that virtually 
any point in Spain can be struck by shakings with similar magnitude than Lorca earthquake, 
corresponding to return periods higher than expected. Given that these earthquakes have shown 
PGA associated with return periods higher than 500 years, it is worth investigating the realistic 
degree of safety of buildings in Spain.  
 
This work is part of a wider long-term research effort aiming to mitigate seismic vulnerability of 
widespread buildings in Spain. Overall approach consists of identifying vulnerable construction 
typologies, evaluating their seismic risk and proposing retrofit strategies, mainly using energy 
dissipators. Inside this long-term research, two major types of RC buildings are considered so far: 
two-way waffle slabs and one-way wide-beam slabs. Regarding abovementioned long-term 
research on wide-beam buildings, earlier works consisted of experiments aiming to characterize 
hysteretic behavior of wide beam-column joints [Benavent-Climent 2007; Benavent-Climent et al. 
2009a,b] providing drift ratio at first yielding and at failure 2.45% and 4.5%, respectively;

displacement ductility was 2.5. Such tests took profit of previous studies by other researchers 
[Popov et al. 1992; Gentry, Wight 1994; Quintero-Febres, Wight 2001; Siah et al. 2003]; these 
studies proposed detailing strategies and concluded that beam width must not exceed bc + 2 hc (bc 
and hc are base and depth of column) to ensure a satisfactory seismic performance. Posterior studies 
investigated numerically vulnerability of code-compliant buildings [Benavent-Climent, Zahran 
2010] and of non-code-compliant buildings [Domínguez 2012; López-Almansa et al. 2013]; first 
study proposed a methodology for assessing seismic capacity of existing frames in terms of energy 
while second study pointed out low seismic capacity of analyzed buildings and need of considering 
cooperation of nonstructural walls. More recent works discuss behavior, under Lorca input, of 
buildings located in Lorca [Benavent-Climent et al. 2013] and of non-code compliant buildings 
located in any zone of Spain [Domínguez et al. 2014], respectively; first study concluded that pilotis 
configuration makes structure prone to damage concentration and reduces its seismic capacity, 
while second study showed that all analyzed buildings would not have survived Lorca earthquake. 
This work is an extension of two aforementioned studies [Benavent-Climent et al. 2013; 
Domínguez et al. 2014] to any type of wide-beam buildings located in any region of Spain. Next 
stage of research will consist in proposing retrofit solutions for these buildings; this activity is 
currently in progress. 
 
Research approach of this paper consists in selecting a number of prototype buildings and 
investigating numerically their performance under Lorca earthquake. Thus, two buildings, 3 and 6-
story, are chosen to represent vast majority of edifices with wide beams located in Spain. Each 
building is designed for three major seismic zones in Spain: low seismicity, moderate seismicity (as 
Lorca) and medium seismicity (as Granada). Finite element models accounting for cooperation of 
masonry infill walls to lateral strength describe structural behavior of prototype buildings; for each 
building, three wall densities are considered: no walls, low wall density and high wall density. 
Overall seismic resistance of prototype buildings is firstly assessed by pushover analysis; then, their 
performance under Lorca earthquake is evaluated from dynamic responses under its most severe 
records. Thus, maximum displacements obtained from time-history analyses are compared with 
capacity of buildings determined from pushover analyses. Since most damage caused by Lorca 
earthquake was generated by debris fall, absolute accelerations are also determined. Given that 
actual buildings are not uniform, sensitivity of obtained results to major building parameters is 
investigated.  
 
This paper shows convincingly that an important number of buildings in Spain would have 
collapsed under an earthquake that actually occurred. This announcement can raise public 
awareness of seismic risk in Spain. Moreover, proposing feasible solutions to this problem, can 
persuade Spanish officials to undertake retrofit campaigns. 
 
2. Wide-beam buildings in Spain 
 

2.1. Description of wide-beam buildings 
 
Wide-beam buildings have a concrete framed structure with one-way slabs. Beams are as deep as 
slabs, thus providing flat soffit, which facilitates construction of slabs and layout of facilities. Figure 
1 displays an image and a sketch of one-way slabs with wide beams.

(b) Wide beam-column connection 

Figure 1. Wide-beam slabs 
 
Wide-beam buildings are potentially highly vulnerable to earthquakes. In wide beams direction, 
following weaknesses can be presumed: 
  
 Low lateral strength and stiffness, because effective depth of beams is small (compared to 

conventional beams). 
 Low ductility, in terms of chord rotation, since total reinforcement amount of wide beams is 

high (commonly ranging between 2% and 6%) to compensate for insufficient effective depth. 
 Considerable strut compressive forces developed inside column-beam joints, due to low height 

of wide beams. This weaknesses correspond mainly to non code-compliant buildings, since 
Spanish design code [NCSE-02] requires strut verification. 

 Beams depth is smaller than their width, therefore, usually beams are wider than columns, and 
part of their longitudinal reinforcement lies outside columns projection (Figure 1.b). Hence, 
contribution of outer zones of beams to bending resistance of connections involves torsion 
mechanisms. However, resistance of strut-and-tie mechanisms cannot be guaranteed, since 
reinforcement is not designed for this purpose in common Spanish practice. 

 
In orthogonal direction, lateral seismic behavior might be even worse, since the only members of 
slabs that contribute to lateral resistance of buildings are joists and façade beams [Domínguez 2012; 
López-Almansa et al. 2013]. 
 

2.2. Prototype buildings 
 
Two prototype buildings are chosen to represent vast majority of wide-beam edifices in Spain. 
Characteristics of both prototypes are determined from an extensive survey among experienced 
designers [Domínguez 2012]. These two buildings have 3 and 6-stories, respectively; first floor is 4 
m high while upper floors are 3 m high. Influence of basements is neglected. Each building has 
fours bays in both directions; columns are regularly distributed and span-length is 5 m in both 
directions. All buildings are regular, having plan symmetry and uniformity along height, with 
uninterrupted columns (continuous down to foundation). Noticeably, in Spain there are only few 
actual asymmetric wide-beam buildings; moreover, do not follow well-defined common patterns. 
Hence, this study considers only symmetric buildings.

Figure 2 displays several views and details of prototype buildings. Figure 2.a and Figure 2.c contain 
overall views of 3-story and 6-story buildings, respectively. Figure 2.e displays a plan view of a 
slab; that sketch highlights that in x direction every slab contains five wide beams while in y 
direction there are two (outer) façade beams and three (inner) joists that are coplanar with columns. 
Figure 2.b and Figure 2.d display cross-sections on y and x directions, respectively; those sketches 
show wide beams wider than columns, whereas façade beams are as wide as columns. Two types of 
joists are typically employed: (i) semi-prefabricated beams, being composed of a lower “sole” and a 
“truss-type” bare reinforcement (Figure 2.b and Figure 2.d), and (ii) prefabricated prestressed

beams. Figure 2.b shows that top splice bars guarantee joists continuity. Figure 2.f displays an 
elevation and a cross section of a column. Figure 2.f shows that lap splices are concentrated in 
bottom sections, in contrast to common recommendations. Transverse reinforcement in wide beams 
consists of single stirrups made of 6-8 mm diameter bars and spaced 15 cm. Transverse 
reinforcement in columns consists of single stirrups made of 6-8 mm diameter bars; in end 
segments (1 m long each) spacing is 7.5 cm, and in center segments (1 m long each) is 15 cm 
(Figure 2.f). Noticeably, both in columns and beams, hook on stirrups or hoops have a bend of 90º, 
instead of 135º. In façade beams, longitudinal reinforcement is described in Figure 2.d and 
transverse reinforcement consists of single stirrups made of 6-8 mm diameter bars and spaced 15 
cm. 
 

  
(a) Low wall density (b) High wall density 

Figure 3. Infill walls layout 
 
Given that lateral resistance of prototype buildings is low, cooperation of nonstructural infill walls 
must be taken into consideration. Work [Ricci et al. 2013] discusses profoundly this issue. In this 
paper, for each prototype building three wall densities are considered: no walls, low wall density 
and high wall density. First and second cases correspond to commercial buildings with light 
claddings, while third case corresponds to houses. Figure 3 depicts typical layouts of walls for 
second and third cases. Only wall panels without openings are considered. Since in Figure 3 infill 
walls are laid symmetrically in both directions, plan symmetry holds. All walls are continuous down 
to foundation; although pilotis (e.g. lack of walls in first floor) are extremely prejudicial [Ricci et al. 
2013; Benavent-Climent et al. 2012, 2013], is not contemplated in this study because this has been 
analyzed in a previous work [Benavent-Climent et al. 2013]. On each level, walls extend to full 
height; therefore, short column effects are not taken into consideration. Walls are unreinforced and 
are stabbed to adjoining columns, without steel ties. Only contribution of walls made with Group 2 
brick units [EN 1996 2005] that are 12 cm thick is accounted for. Cooperation of walls made with 
Group 3 or Group 4 brick units [EN 1996 2005] is neglected, given their brittle behavior [Martínez 
et al. 2001]. Characteristic values of brick and mortar strengths are 12 and 8 MPa, respectively. 
 
Each prototype building is designed for low, moderate and medium seismicity. Seismicity is 
established in terms of design Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) according to Spanish regulations 
[NCSE-02 2002]: low PGA < 0.08 g, moderate 0.08 g ≤ PGA < 0.16 g, and medium 0.16 g ≤ PGA. 
Low seismicity buildings are designed without any seismic provision (PGA = 0.0 g) and are termed 
thereafter non-code-compliant buildings. Buildings for moderate and medium seismicity regions are 
located in Lorca (PGA = 0.12 g) and Granada (PGA = 0.23 g), respectively. Differentiating 
characteristics of prototype buildings without and with seismic design are described next.

Non code-compliant buildings. Characteristic value of concrete compressive strength is fck = 17.5 
MPa; top concrete layer of slabs is unreinforced and is 4 cm deep (Figure 2.d and Figure 2.e). Steel 
type is AEH 400 S [EH-80 1980]; yield point and ultimate stress and strain are fyk = 410 MPa, fu = 
530 MPa, and εu = 14%, respectively. 
 
Code-compliant buildings. Prototype buildings in moderate and medium seismicity regions are 
designed according to current Spanish [NCSE-02 2002] code. However, since major objective of 
this paper is to asses actual buildings, recommendations of NCSE-02 that are commonly ignored by 
designers, are also disregarded. Design is based on static equivalent forces in both horizontal 
directions. Static forces are obtained from response spectra for 5% damping. Aforementioned 
design accelerations (0.12 g and 0.23 g) correspond to stiff soil (360 < vs,30 < 800 m/s, where vs,30 is 
shear wave velocity averaged over top 30 m) and 500 year return period. Initially, for each building, 
four major soil types included in European regulations [EN 1998 2004] are considered: A (rock, 
vs,30 > 800 m/s), B (stiff soil, 360 < vs,30 < 800 m/s), C (soft soil, 180 < vs,30 < 360 m/s) and D (very 
soft soil, vs,30 < 180 m/s). However, it is found that wide-beam buildings are not feasible in soils B, 
C and D because design would require excessive slabs depth and too massive columns; therefore, 
finally only soil A is considered. For soil A, beams cannot be as wide as in non-code-compliant 
buildings because of code limitations in percentage of top longitudinal reinforcement of beams that 
lie out of column projection. Response reduction factor is 2, and no accidental eccentricity is 
considered. Seismic structural design is done emulating common practices in Spain; accordingly, 
cooperation of masonry infill walls is not taken into consideration. Characteristic value of concrete 
compressive strength is fck = 25 MPa; top concrete layer of slabs is reinforced (15 × 15 cm wire 
mesh made with 5 mm diameter bars) and is 5 cm deep. Steel type is B 500 SD [EHE 2008] (high 
ductility); yield point and ultimate stress and strain are fyk = 500 MPa, fu = 575 MPa, and εu = 16%, 
respectively. Given abovementioned lack of fulfillment of some code recommendations, hierarchy 
of resistance between columns and beams is not considered. As well, regarding joists, are designed 
only for gravity loads and bottom reinforcement bars are not adequately anchored. Noticeably, 
NCSE-02 advises that joists are designed as main beams, although this suggestion is not widely 
fulfilled.

3. Modeling of behavior of prototype buildings 
 

3.1. Structural models 
 
Structural behavior of buildings in each direction is described with 2D finite element models. Each 
model includes five frames (Figure 2); rigid fictitious pin-ended bars (represented with dot lines in 
Figure 16) connect outer nodes of those frames, at each story level, to account for rigid diaphragm 
effect provided by slabs. Time integration is done using Newmark-β method [Newmark 1959] with 
β = 1/6 (linearly varying acceleration method); time step is 0.001 s and damping is described by a 
5% Rayleigh model. Given the high lateral flexibility of studied buildings, second-order analyses 
are performed; however, in most cases differences with first-order analyses are small. Derived 
model is implemented in program IDARC-2D, version 7.0 [Kunnath, Reinhorn 2010]. 
 

3.2. Modeling of frames 
 
Beams and columns are represented by 2-node frame elements. Connections between columns and 
wide beams (x direction) and between columns and façade beams (y direction) are modeled as rigid, 
given that reinforcement is satisfactorily anchored [Domínguez 2012]. Conversely, connections 
between columns and joists (y direction) are modeled as rigid for negative bending moments and as 
pinned for positive bending moments, given that lower longitudinal reinforcement bars are not 
adequately anchored, as shown by Figure 2.d. Stiffness and strength of joists correspond to its 
rectangular section (Figure 2.e). Bottom floor columns are clamped to foundation. 
 
Concrete and steel behavior is described by uniaxial constitutive laws. Steel stress-strain diagram is 
trilinear; first branch corresponds to elastic domain, second branch is horizontal (after yielding) and 
third branch accounts for strain hardening. Concrete constitutive law is parabola-rectangle; tension 
strength is neglected [EN 1992 2003]. 
 
Nonlinear behavior is concentrated in plastic hinges located at both member ends; plastic hinges 
length ranges between 20 and 30 cm. Hysteretic behavior is described by polygonal hysteretic 
model (PHM). PHM refers to models based on piecewise linear behavior. A detailed description of 
general framework for PHMs can be found in [Sivaselvan, Reinhorn 1999]. PHM model uses a non-

 
 
7 



symmetric monotonic envelope defined by elastic stiffness Ke, secant stiffness K0, cracking 
moment Mc, yield moment My, curvature-ductility factor μφ, and four parameters that control 
effects of stiffness degradation (HC), strength degradation (HBE, HBD) and pinching (HS) 
[Reinhorn et al. 2009]. Stiffness degradation is modeled by pivot rule: load-reversal branches target 
a pivot point on elastic branch whose position is controlled by parameter HC. Strength degradation 
is modeled reducing capacity in backbone curve according to parameters HBE and HBD accounting 
for dissipated energy and plastic deformation, respectively. Pinching occurs as a result of crack 
closure, bond slip and other phenomena. Slip is modeled by stating crack closing point as a target 
point for loading branch; force corresponding to this point is a fraction of yielding moment being 
controlled by parameter HS. A more detailed explanation can be found in [Reinhorn et al, 2009]. 
My is determined according to [ACI 318-08 2008], obtained results are calibrated with Response 
2000 program [Bentz, Collins 1992], agreement proves satisfactory. Cracking curvature is 
determined from initial sectional stiffness Ke, accounting for contribution of reinforcement. K0 is 
calculated by multiplying initial elastic sectional stiffness of gross sections by an empirical factor 
taking into account effects of concrete cracking and axial force [Sugano 1968]. Parameters μφ, HC, 
HBE, HBD and HS are calibrated with previous tests [Benavent-Climent 2007, Benavent-Climent 
et al. 2009a,b] on one exterior and one interior wide beam-column subassemblies. For wide beams 
in exterior connections and for façade beams, good fittings are obtained with HBD = 0, HS = 0.2, 
μφ = 12, HC = 2, HBE = 0.6; for wide beams in interior connections, HBD = 0, HS = 0.2, μφ = 21, 
HC = 3.5, HBE = 0.4. For exterior columns, HBD = 0, HS = 0.2, μφ = 3, HC = 1.8, HBE = 0.6; and 
for interior columns HBD = 0, HS = 0.2, μφ = 3, HC = 3.1, HBE = 0.4 [Benavent-Climent, Zahran 
2010]. Curvature ductility μφ considered for interior wide-beams is similar to the one adopted in 
[Masi 2003] for flexible beams of post-1970 Italian RC frames designed only for gravity loads 
(μφ = 20). Moreover, assumed values of μφ provide chord rotation ductility ratios close to those 
obtained in tests. For joists, HBD = 0, HS = 0.2, HC = 3.5, HBE = 0.4; given the lack of 
experimental results, ductility curvature is conservatively estimated as μφ = 4. Noticeably, since 
contribution of joists to transverse lateral resistance is low, it is expected that overall behavior of 
buildings in transverse direction (y) is not highly sensitive to this parameter. Joint panels are 
assumed to be infinitely rigid. Values of µϕ are identified from experiments on beam-column 
connections representative of real constructions; therefore, take into account confinement 
contribution 
 
Methods proposed in [Benavent-Climent 2009a, 2009b] are applied to estimate influence of 
incomplete torsion capacity of outer zones of wide beams. In both non code-compliant and code-
compliant buildings, it is checked that joints do not fail prior than beams or columns; as well, it is 
verified that, in any section of members, shear failure do not precede flexural one. 
 

3.3. Modeling of infill walls 
 
Compression-only bars joining adjacent floors represent masonry infill walls. Their hysteretic 
behavior is simulated with Bouc-Wen models [Baber, Noori 1985]. Those models provide bilinear 
behavior, as shown by Figure 4, displaying envelope of shear force V versus lateral displacement u.

Figure 4. Envelope of shear force vs. lateral displacement for wall modelling 
 
In Figure 4, VYIM is yield force, EAIW is initial stiffness, and MU is displacement ductility. 
Resistance VYIM is obtained from tie-and-strut models, where two major failure modes are 
contemplated: diagonal strut compression and horizontal sliding along a course. Resistance is 
obtained from tie-and-strut models, where two major failure modes are considered: diagonal strut 
compression and horizontal sliding along a course. In all analyzed cases, resistance for first failure 
mode is significantly smaller. Parameters for tie-and-strut models are estimated as indicated by 
Eurocode 6 [EN 1996 2005]. As suggested in [Mostafaei, Kabeyasawa 2004], initial stiffness is 
estimated as two times ratio between ultimate resistance and displacement. Post-peak behavior is 
not considered. Wall characteristic strength and secant longitudinal and transverse deformation 
moduli [Martínez et al. 2001] are

𝐸𝐸 = 500 𝑓𝑓k = 2391 MPa 𝐺𝐺 = 0.4 𝐸𝐸 = 956 MPa 
 
Coefficient K is chosen according to brick unit type (clay, group 2), mortar type (general purpose) 
and presence of longitudinal joints. After these results, chosen values of design parameters are 
VYIW = 352 kN, EAIW = 56 kN/mm and MU = 15 [Pujol et al. 2008]. 
 
Risk of failure of columns due to their interaction with adjoining infill walls is verified. Short-
column effects [Mehrabi et al. 1994] are ignored, since length of columns in contact with diagonal 
struts is rather small [Domínguez 2012], ranging between 0.68 and 0.80 m [Paulay, Priestley, 1992]. 
Shear failure of columns generated by diagonal compressive forces is checked by verifying that 
columns fulfill strength and ductility requirement of Spanish design code [EHE 2008]. It is also 
checked  that columns are able to resist, with safety margin higher than 20% [EHE 2008], 
maximum shear forces compatible with plastic moments (determined accounting for actual axial 
forces) at their end sections.  
 
4. Pushover analysis of prototype buildings 
 
Two-dimensional pushover analyses are performed using model described in section 3. Since 
behavior of infill walls is described with dynamic models, capacity curves are not obtained by static 
nonlinear analyses but with incremental nonlinear dynamic analyses using a given ground motion 
record scaled with different factors. Selected input is NS component of Tolmezzo-Diga Ambiesta

record of Friuli earthquake (06/05/1976) [ESD 2014]. Results obtained with that accelerogram are 
compared with those calculated with other inputs; agreement is satisfactory, both in terms of forces 
and displacements [Domínguez 2012]. Moreover, conventional incremental static analyses are 
performed for buildings without walls; no relevant differences between static and dynamic analyses 
are observed. For further reliability, results of IDARC program are satisfactorily compared with 
other results obtained with SeismoStruct code [Seismosoft 2013]. 
 
Figure 5 and Figure 6 display capacity curves of 3 and 6-story prototype buildings, respectively. 
Vertical / horizontal axis represents maximum base shear force / top floor displacement during input 
duration; both magnitudes occur almost simultaneously. Symbols  and  describe level of 
damage in columns and beams.  corresponds to first full development in any plastic hinge and  
indicates first failure in any plastic hinge. Full development means that yielding moment is reached 
and failure corresponds to full hinge (e.g. zero moment, final residual strength is exhausted). For the 
sake of comparison with time-history analyses under Lorca record, collapse points are defined. 
Given that walls failure do not imply global collapse and walls fail earlier than frames, it is assumed 
that final displacement capacity of buildings with and without walls is roughly the same. Therefore, 
collapse is defined as point of capacity curves (for building without walls) right before final 
descending branch. In all curves in Figure 5 and Figure 6 except Figure 6.b, collapse point 
coincides with first failure (). In Figure 6.b, absence of symbol  is due to premature analysis 
termination. 
 
Plots from Figure 5 and Figure 6 show regular and expected behavior. Main observations are: 
 
 Comparison between no walls, low wall density and high wall density. Walls increase 

significantly initial stiffness [Cardone 2007], this being coherent with values of fundamental 
periods displayed in Table 1. In terms of displacement, walls fail earlier than main frame, as 
shown by after-peak descendant branches of buildings with walls. However, for larger 
displacements, such branches converge with corresponding curves of buildings without walls. 
This convergence can be read as complete vanishing of walls capacity. As expected, points  
are situated approximately in same vertical, regardless of wall density. 

 Comparison between x and y directions. As expected, in x and y directions capacity curves 
for buildings without walls are different, but those of buildings with walls are similar, since 
important capacity and stiffness of walls govern behavior. 

 Comparison between 0.0g, 0.12g and 0.23g. In terms of forces, capacity of buildings with 
walls is similar, since their contribution clearly exceeds the one of main frame. Regarding 
buildings without walls, those designed without seismic provision (B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g) 
exhibit slightly smaller resistance; however, higher strength of buildings B3-0.12g, B6-0.12g, 
B3-0.23g and B6-0.23g hardly compensates their greater weight. For any wall density, 
displacement ductility is not clearly correlated to design PGA. 

 Comparison between 3 and 6-story buildings. Resisted base shear coefficient is smaller in 6-
story buildings; conversely, displacement ductility is rather similar. 

 
5. Lorca earthquake  
 

5.1. Principal characteristics of Lorca earthquake 
 
2011 Lorca earthquake (11-05-2011) is most damaging seismic event recorded in Spain [IGN 
2011]. Its magnitude is rather moderate (Mw = 5.1; [IGME 2011]), therefore, intensity is mostly 
contributed by other circumstances, as extremely shallow hypocenter (hypocentral depth is 
estimated as 2 km), high proximity between epicenter and city center (2.9 km to seismologic 

 
 

10 



station) and ensuing near-fault effects. Figure 7 displays most severe accelerograms [IGN 2011]; 
those inputs were recorded in stiff soil, characterized by vs,30 between 360 and 800 m/s. Maximum 
acceleration of NS component is approximately 0.37 g, more than three times PGA prescribed for 
Lorca by Spanish design code (0.12 g) [NSCE-02 2002].

severity. ID is dimensionless seismic index [Manfredi 2001] given by 𝐼𝐼D =
∫ �̈�𝑥g2 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

. ID accounts 
broadly for velocity pulses content; small / big values of ID correspond to records with / without 
pulses. PI is pulse index [Baker 2007], which ranges between 0 and 1; records with scores above 
0.85 and below 0.15 are classified as pulses and non-pulses, respectively. Ep is relative pulse energy 
[Zhai et al. 2013], representing portion of ground motion energy that corresponds to pulse; pulse is 
extracted by peak-point method [Dickinson, Gavin 2011]. Values of Ep greater than 0.3 correspond 
to pulse-like records and values equal to or below 0.3 are ambiguous. Trifunac duration is time 
elapsed between 5% and 95% of Arias Intensity [Trifunac, Brady 1975]. Bracket duration 
[Kempton, Stewart 2006] is time elapsed between instants when 5% of maximum acceleration is 
exceeded for first and last time, respectively. Table 3 shows that Lorca accelerograms are clearly 
pulse-like. Comparison between NS and EW components highlights relevant directivity effects 
already underlined by previous studies [Martínez-Díaz et al. 2012; López-Comino et al. 2013].

Figure 8. Response spectra of accelerograms of Lorca earthquake 
 
Significant severity of Lorca earthquake can be also highlighted by its response spectra. Figure 8 
displays response spectra of accelerograms in Figure 7. Figure 8.a represents absolute acceleration 
response spectra (Sa) [Domínguez 2012] and Figure 8.b displays input energy spectra in terms of 
velocity (VE) [Benavent-Climent et al. 2013]. Design response spectra from Spanish code [NCSE-
02 2002] for Lorca (0.12 g) and Granada (0.23 g) are also plotted in Figure 8.a.; comparison shows 
that demanding NS spectral ordinates clearly exceed design ones for virtually all periods of interest. 
Analogously, in Figure 8.b, a design spectrum previously derived for Spain [Benavent-Climent et 
al. 2002] is also plotted; comparison with obtained spectra shows that agreement among initial 
branches is satisfactory and that NS component peak significantly exceeds plateau ordinate. 
Noticeably, this design spectrum is significantly more demanding than Spanish code [NSCE-02 
2002]. 
 
High intensity of Lorca earthquake confirms practical interest of analyzing its effect on 
performance of widespread and potentially vulnerable buildings.  
 

5.2. Aftermath 
 
Effects of Lorca earthquake were serious. It caused 9 fatalities, 167 injured (3 severe), 40000 
homeless, and important material losses: nearly 80% of buildings in Lorca city (less than 5 km 
away from epicenter) were significantly affected. Most damage concentrated on 2-story and ancient 
stone masonry heritage buildings; many had been designed without any seismic provision. Among 
buildings with more than two stories, most common structure is reinforced concrete frames without 
structural walls. Infill masonry walls are not separated from main structure, thus influencing lateral 
structural behavior. In actual buildings, there are several patterns of walls distribution; in some 
cases, first floor does not have walls (pilotis configuration) and subsequent soft-story mechanism

led to severe damages. Globally speaking, RC wide-beam buildings without pilotis configuration 
(e.g. infill walls continuous down to foundation) experienced less severe damage; such damage 
affected both structural and non-structural elements. An important number of such buildings had 
been designed following recent seismic codes. Works [Benavent-Climent et al. 2012, 2013] contain 
deep assessments of observed damage. 
 
Some issues of Lorca earthquake require deeper analysis. Just one building actually collapsed, 
without casualties; all fatalities and virtually all injured were caused by falling debris impact. An 
explanation follows. Main shake was preceded by a weaker foreshock (Mw = 4.6) trailed by a 
number of minor aftershocks; then, after less than two hours, main shake (Mw = 5.1) came. 
Foreshock pushed people out of their homes and minor aftershocks prevented them from reentering; 
unfortunately, most people remained on side of buildings, thus being hit by falling nonstructural 
cladding elements.  
 

5.3. Published research 
 
Apart from timely reports [Cabañas et al. 2011; Feriche et al. 2011; Goula et al. 2011; IGME 2011; 
IGN 2011], a relevant number of studies on Lorca earthquake have been published. Some papers 
have focused on seismological issues [Vissers, Meijninger 2011; López-Comino et al. 2012; 
Martínez-Díaz et al. 2012]; papers dealing with structural aspects are more relevant to this work and 
are discussed next. 
 
 Feriche et al. 2012. This work describes damage in 22 buildings; 18 are 3- to 11-story 

reinforced concrete buildings and 4 are 2- to 4-story brick masonry buildings. This work 
emphasizes consequences of common design mistakes: vertical irregularity, soft first story, 
horizontal asymmetry, unaligned slabs, short columns, insufficient transverse reinforcement, 
pounding, among other issues.  

 Benavent-Climent et al. 2012, 2013. These works assess expected damage on buildings 
subjected to Lorca earthquake through an energy-based approach and nonlinear dynamic 
analyses. It is highlighted that many of damaged structures are RC frames with wide beams. 
Influence of pilotis configuration with masonry infill walls is further investigated. It is found 
that pilotis masonry infill walls makes structure highly prone to damage concentration and 
reduces overall seismic capacity. As well, a proper strong column-weak beam mechanism and 
adequate counter-measures to avoid interaction between infill walls and main frame, would 
have reduced damage significantly. 

 De Luca et al. 2013. This work discusses structural role played by masonry infills on RC 
buildings under Lorca earthquake. Observed damage and numerical analyses show that 
masonry infills provided additional strength to RC buildings. 

 Hermanns et al. 2013. This paper deals with seismic performance, during Lorca earthquake, of 
3- to 8-story buildings with masonry infill walls. It is stated that pieces of façades of several 
buildings fell down, killing 9 people. Masonry walls suffered important damage causing failure 
of some columns. Structural behavior is analyzed with non-linear Finite Element Models; in 
light of obtained results, observed failure patterns are explained.  

 Vidal et al. 2013. This paper investigates changes in fundamental period and damping ratio of a 
number of low-to-medium rise Lorca RC buildings from pre- and post-earthquake ambient 
vibration data. Measurements show a significant after-quake period elongation; conversely, 
damping ratio keeps rather constant. 

 Navarro et al. 2014. This paper studies shallow geology of Lorca and correlates it with 
observed damage. It is concluded that damage is specially concentrated in areas where soil 
period is between 0.3 and 0.5 s and that seismic demand has been high for buildings with 4 to 6 

 
 

15 



stories. 
 Gómez-Martínez et al. 2015. This work concludes that most losses were caused by non-

structural damage and that masonry infill walls provided additional strength to reinforced 
concrete buildings.  

 Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2015. A probabilistic seismic risk assessment is performed for buildings 
of Lorca. A building-by-building resolution level is used allowing generation of risk maps.

buildings are oriented with wide beams in NS direction; in Figures #.c and #.d, buildings are rotated

vertical axis, are also plotted as upper and lower bounds.

Time-histories displayed in Figure 9 through Figure 14 and figures in Table 4 show 
regular behavior. Indeed, displacements are higher in: (i) 6-story buildings, (ii) buildings with less 
walls and smaller design acceleration, (iii) weakest direction (y), and (iv) under strongest 
component (NS). Beyond these obvious observations, major remarks are: 
 
 Buildings without walls. Not any building survives Lorca input in both directions. 
 Buildings with low wall density. 3-story buildings without seismic provisions (B3-0.0g) 

collapse in both directions. 3-story buildings with seismic provisions (B3-0.12g and B3-0.23g) 
resist Lorca input with moderate damage in columns and beams (Park & Ang damage index 
[Park, Ang 1985] ranges between 0.03 and 0.485), although walls in direction of strongest

component (NS) might collapse; this last statement is supported by comparison with capacity 
curves shown in Figure 5. 6-story buildings (B6-0.0g, B6-0.12g and B6-0.23g) collapse, at least 
in one direction. 

 Buildings with high wall density. Buildings without seismic provisions (B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g) 
collapse, at least in one direction. Buildings with seismic provisions (B3-0.12g, B3-0.23g, B6-
0.12g and B6-0.23g) resist Lorca input with no or moderate damage in columns and beams 
(Park & Ang damage index ranges between zero and 0.235); in buildings B6-0.12g and B6-
0.23g, walls in direction of strongest component (NS) might experience serious damage. This 
last statement relies on capacity curves displayed in Figure 5 and Figure 6. 

 
6.2. Absolute acceleration response 

 
As discussed in subsection 5.2, all fatalities and most of injured were caused by detachment of 
untied cladding elements. Therefore, absolute acceleration response is of primary importance. 
Figure 15 displays time histories of absolute accelerations of top floor of building B3-0.23g.

Table 5 generalizes results displayed in Figure 15. Table 5 shows maximum absolute accelerations 
in top floors of prototype buildings. Like in Table 4, “-” refer to collapse. 
 
Figures from Table 5 show that many accelerations are extremely high, thus explaining important 
number of cladding failures observed in Lorca. Moreover, non-structural elements were not 
adequately fixed to structure, as commonly observed in Spain. Table 5 provides following major 
remarks: 
 
 Wall density. Accelerations of buildings without walls are 1.5 to 2.5 times smaller. This 

difference can be explained because response spectra ordinates (Figure 8.a) are lower for 
fundamental periods of buildings without walls (Table 1).  

 NS / EW components. Regardless of building direction, accelerations under strong component 
are higher. 

 Design PGA. Seismic design has no significant influence in response acceleration.  
 Number of stories. In most cases, accelerations are clearly higher in 3-story buildings. Only 

exceptions correspond to buildings with high wall density. These tendencies can be explained 
by relation between fundamental periods (Table 1) and response spectra (Figure 8). 

 
6.3. Damage distribution 

 
Damage distribution patterns allow deeper insights on performance of analyzed buildings. Figure 16 
and Figure 17 display examples of collapsed and not collapsed buildings, respectively.  
 
Figure 16 refers to collapse mechanisms of buildings without walls B3-0.0g (Figure 9.d) and B6-
0.0g (Figure 12.d) in wide beams (x) direction under EW component. Figure 16 represents location 
and condition of each plastic hinge. Points “”correspond to onset of damage, either steel yielding 
or concrete cracking, points “” refer to formation of plastic hinge (yielding moment) and points 
“”,indicate hinge failure (zero moment). Figure 16 shows also Park & Ang damage index 
[Park, Ang 1985] of each story and of whole building. Figure 16 shows that most hinges commence 
and develop in columns, indicating a brittle “weak column-strong 
beam” collapse mechanism. Comparison between both buildings shows that in B6-0.0g, damage is 
more concentrated in lower levels.

Figure 16, most of hinges appear in columns.

These observations will be used in further stages of research to propose tailored retrofit strategies.  
 

6.4. Energy balances 
 
Energy balance equation can provide relevant information on damage. That equation states that 
input energy is decomposed into damping, kinetic, and spring energy. Damping energy is dissipated 
through ordinary mechanisms, i.e. without additional damage. Spring energy accounts for sum of 
elastic potential and damaging energy; latter is energy that causes supplementary damage. 
Noticeably, once structural motion finishes, kinetic energy vanishes and, in structures whose 
response is mainly in nonlinear range, potential energy is negligible compared to plastic strain 
energy. Figure 18 displays time histories of energy components of buildings B3-0.23g (Figure 18.a) 
and B6-0.12g (Figure 18.b), both without walls, under EW component; such cases correspond to 
Figure 11.d and Figure 13.b, respectively. Figure 18 confirms that buildings suffer only moderate 
damage, since most input energy is dissipated by damping, and only approximately one sixth is 
absorbed and dissipated by spring.

Figure 18. Time histories of energy. EW component. 
 
For the sake of higher reliability, input energy in Figure 18 is compared with spectral ordinates in 
Figure 8.b. Input energy EI is linked to equivalent velocity VE by EI = ½ m VE

2 where m is building 
mass [Akiyama 1985]. Table 1 shows that, for building B3-0.23g, weight is 12005 kN and 
fundamental period is 0.24 s; for building B6-0.12g, such values are 26542 kN and 1.1 s. After 
these periods, EI is obtained from spectrum in Figure 8.b:

 𝑚𝑚 𝑉𝑉E
2 =

 26542 × 0.232 = 70 kNm 
 
For building B6-0.12g, this result fits reasonably well with final input energy in Figure 18.b. 
Conversely, for building B3-0.23g, comparison with Figure 18.a shows higher discrepancy. This 
disagreement is due to consideration of initial (elastic) fundamental period to derive spectral 
ordinate VE in Figure 8.b. When building undergoes plastic deformations, fundamental period TF 
elongates and input energy is governed by a longer effective period. As shown in Figure 8.b, in 
vicinity of fundamental period of building B3-0.23g, elongation of TF yields much higher values of 
VE and, therefore, of EI; in contrast, in vicinity of fundamental period of building B6-0.12g, shape 
of VE spectrum is approximately flat and elongation of TF changes only slightly VE. 
 
7. Sensitivity analysis of numerical results 
 

7.1. Parameters of analysis  
 
As discussed in subsection 1, objective of this paper is to investigate survivability of widespread 
Spanish wide-beam buildings under Lorca earthquake. Therefore, a number of prototype buildings 
are selected to represent most common wide-beam buildings in Spain. However, parameters of 
actual buildings are not uniform; therefore, to derive sounder conclusions, it is necessary to 
investigate sensitivity to major parameters of buildings. Parameters are selected accounting for its 
potential influence on results and their ranges are established based on its variability in actual 
buildings. Parameters are grouped into: geometrical (subsection 7.2), structural (subsection 7.3), 
wall (subsection 7.4) and damping (subsection 7.5)

This subsection investigates influence of major geometrical parameters of prototype buildings in 
their response under Lorca input. Parameters are span-length and column size; their ranges are 
decided after survey in [Domínguez 2012]. 
 
Span-length. In most of wide-beam buildings in Spain, span-length ranges between 5 m and 
slightly bigger values. Therefore, 5 m and 5.5 m are taken. Figure 19 displays top floor 
displacement response of building B3-0.0g with span-length 5.5 m. Comparison with Figure 9 
(corresponding to same building with span-length 5 m) shows that results are rather similar showing 
that span-length influence is only moderate. For instance, in Figure 9.d, maximum displacement of 
building B3-0.0g (with high wall density) in x direction is 17.5 mm and in Figure 19.d such 
displacement is 13 mm.

Column section. In most wide-beam buildings in Spain, columns are either square or rectangular. 
Figure 20 displays top floor displacement response of building B6-0.0g with rectangular columns. 
Instead of square sections shown in Table 1, first and top floor columns are 60 × 50 and 40 × 30 
cm2, respectively. Comparison with Figure 12 (corresponding to same building with square 
columns) shows that results are rather similar, since there is collapse in all cases. Therefore, 
columns size influence is only moderate.

These results show that major geometrical parameters of prototype buildings do not affect 
significantly their response under Lorca input. Reference [Domínguez 2012] contains more results 
supporting this statement. 
 

7.3. Influence of structural parameters 
 
This subsection discusses influence of major structural parameters. Parameters are concrete and 
steel strength, and coefficients characterizing hysteretic behavior of plastic hinges. Regarding 
plastic hinges, its behavior is characterized by parameters HBD (strength degradation) and HS 
(pinching); not any of them has shown relevant influence. Representative results regarding 
influence of concrete and steel strength are presented and discussed next. 
 
Concrete. Concrete is mainly characterized by compressive strength fck. As discussed in subsection 
2.3, it is assumed that fck = 17.5 MPa for non code-compliant buildings (B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g) and 
fck = 25 MPa for code-compliant buildings (B3-0.12g, B3-0.23g, B6-0.12g and B6-0.23g). 
Conversely, given that current Spanish regulations [EHE 2008] state that minimum concrete 
strength is 25 MPa, it is assumed in this subsection for all buildings. Moreover, fck is characteristic 
value, while mean one (fcm) would represent more realistically actual behavior of buildings. 
Therefore, fcm is used instead of fck is in this subsection. Regarding that, European regulations [EN 
1992 2003] indicate that fcm = fck + 8 MPa. Furthermore, in existing buildings, concrete strength is 
significantly higher than fcm, since it corresponds to 28 days age; assuming Class N cement [EN 
1992 2003], increment is approximately 30%. Therefore, fcm = (25 + 8) 1.30 = 43 MPa. Given that 
walls contribution is relevant and would conceal influence of concrete strength, only buildings 
without walls are considered herein. Regarding code-compliant buildings, Figure 21 displays top 
floor relative displacement response of buildings B3-0.23g and B6-0.12g without walls under EW 
component of Lorca input. Figure 21.a refers to building B3-0.23g in longitudinal direction (x,

Figure 11.d) and Figure 21.a represents building B6-0.12g in transverse direction (y, Figure 13.b). 
Concrete strength ranges between 25 MPa (as in Figure 13.b) and 43 MPa. Plots from Figure 21 
show that concrete strength affects significantly responses, both in peak values (Figure 21.a) and in 
permanent displacements (Figure 21.b).

Figure 21. Influence of concrete strength in top floor relative displacement response of code-compliant 
buildings B3-0.23g and B6-0.12g without walls. EW component 

 
Regarding non code-compliant buildings without walls, if fcm = 43 MPa, only in two cases there is 
no collapse: buildings B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g in x direction under EW component of Lorca record. 
Figure 9.d and Figure 12.d show that those cases with fck = 17.5 MPa collapse. However, these 
results lack of practical interest, since in the other direction (y direction under NS component), there 
is collapse in any case.  
 
Steel. Steel is mainly characterized by yield point fyk. Several experimental studies [Otani et al. 
2003; Benavent-Climent et al. 2015] highlighted relevant influence of strain rate. Following 
recommendations contained in these investigations, 12.5% increment of fyk is considered in this 
subsection. As discussed in subsection 2.3, fyk = 410 MPa is assumed for non code-compliant 
buildings (B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g) and fyk = 500 MPa for code-compliant buildings (B3-0.12g, B3-
0.23g, B6-0.12g and B6-0.23g). Conversely, following common current practices, fyk = 500 MPa is 
adopted in this subsection for all buildings; as well, concrete strength is 43 MPa. Given that walls 
contribution is relevant and would mask influence of steel strength, only buildings without walls are 
studied herein. Regarding code-compliant buildings, Figure 22 displays top floor relative 
displacement response of buildings B3-0.23g and B6-0.12g without walls under EW component of 
Lorca input. Figure 22.a refers to building B3-0.23g in longitudinal direction (x, Figure 21.a) and 
Figure 22.a represents building B6-0.12g in transverse direction (y, Figure 21.b). Plots from Figure 
22 show that steel strength influences response less intensively than concrete strength (Figure 21). 
This difference is mainly due to smallest range of variation and brittle sectional behavior of wide 
beams, with concrete failure preceding steel yielding. 
 
Regarding non code-compliant buildings without walls, if fyk = 562.5 MPa, only in two cases there 
is no collapse: buildings B3-0.0g and B6-0.0g in y direction under EW component of Lorca record. 
Figure 9.b and Figure 12.b show that those cases with fyk = 410 MPa collapse. However, these 
results lack of practical interest since in the other direction (x direction under NS component), there 
is collapse in any case.

Results from this subsection show significant influence of major structural parameters, mainly 
concrete strength. Nevertheless, major statements from subsection 6.1 (mainly Table 4) hold. 
 

7.4. Influence of wall parameters  
 
Walls effect is considered through their initial stiffness (EAIW), strength (VYIW) and ductility 
(MU). Among these parameters, only VYIW and MU have shown relevant influence; representative 
results are presented and discussed next. Ranges of these parameters are wide, since control of 
nonstructural elements is commonly loose. 
 
Strength. Figure 23 displays top floor relative displacement response of building B3-0.23g in wide 
beams direction (x) subjected to NS component of Lorca input. In Figure 23, high and low wall 
densities, and VYIW = 252 kN and VYIW = 452 kN are combined. Comparison with Figure 11.a 
(showing results for VYIW = 352 kN), shows that wall strength influence is relevant, thus 
confirming leading role played by walls both in low and high wall density buildings.

Ductility. As discussed in subsection 3.3, reference [Pujol et al. 2008] shows that MU = 15 
provides better fit for ductile infill walls. In this study, low ductility walls with MU = 2 are also 
contemplated. Figure 24 displays comparisons among top floor time-history responses of code-
compliant building B3-0.23g for MU = 15 and MU = 2. Responses correspond to NS component in 
wide beams direction. Figure 24.a shows that, for high wall density, response is insensitive to MU.

Conversely, for low wall density, Figure 24.b shows some sensitivity to MU. This distinct behavior 
can be explained by absence of damage in Figure 24.a (Park & Ang index is 0.0032).

Results from this subsection show moderate influence of major wall structural parameters. In any 
case, major statements from subsection 6.1 (mainly Table 4) hold.

In actual buildings, damping ratio can commonly exhibit only minor fluctuations. Moreover, recent 
studies [Martinelli, Filippou 2009; Benavent-Climent et al. 2013] have shown that near collapse 
behavior can be better reproduced using small damping factors, frequently near 1%. Thus, this 
subsection presents a study regarding damping influence. Figure 25 displays top floor 
displacements of building B3-0.23g with damping factor ranging between 1 and 6%; results 
correspond to wide beams direction (x) and NS component. Plots from Figure 25 show a regular 
and expectable behavior, with non-neglectable sensitivity. Regarding small variations of damping 
factors, comparison between Figure 25.c and Figure 25.d shows only moderate influence. 
Regarding consideration of small damping factors, Figure 25.a shows that such assumption leads to 
big amplitude and permanent displacements. Given that this issue is still open, no final remarks can 
be stated. 
 
8. Conclusions 
 
This work presents a numerical study on dynamic response to Lorca earthquake (11-05-2011) of 3 
and 6-story wide-beam prototype buildings. Given the low lateral resistance of main frame, 
cooperation of masonry infill walls is accounted for. Those buildings are designed for low, 
moderate and medium seismicity regions of Spain. Buildings in low seismicity region are designed 
without any seismic consideration. Obtained results show that: 
 
 Buildings without walls. No building is expected to survive Lorca Earthquake. Common 

weaknesses that are presumable in wide-beam buildings contribute to this highly unsatisfactory 
seismic performance, combined with low concrete strength. In most cases, failure corresponds 
to brittle weak column-strong beam collapse mechanisms. 

 Buildings with low wall density. 3-story buildings without seismic provisions collapse. 3-story 
buildings with seismic provisions resist Lorca input with moderate damage in columns and 
beams. All 6-story buildings collapse.

Figure 25. Influence of damping in top floor relative displacement response of code-compliant building B3-
0.23g with high wall density. NS component. Wide beams direction (x) 

 
Absolute response accelerations are determined; infill walls increase maximum accelerations 1.5 to 
2.5 times. High obtained values explain important non-structural damage observed during Lorca 
earthquake; debris fall caused all fatalities.  
 
Reliability of these conclusions is confirmed by a sensitivity analysis with respect to major 
geometrical, structural and damping parameters. This analysis has shown that influence of 
geometrical and damping parameters is only moderate, while structural parameters, mainly concrete 
and wall strength, exhibit higher influence. Nevertheless, major statements from basic study hold. A 
research aiming to propose retrofit strategies is currently in progress.
