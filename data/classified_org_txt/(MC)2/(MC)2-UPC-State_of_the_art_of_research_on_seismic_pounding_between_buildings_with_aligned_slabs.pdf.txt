Alireza KHARAZIAN1 and Francisco LÓPEZ-ALMANSA2 

 
ABSTRACT 

 
Collision between adjoining buildings with aligned slabs is relevant, since the huge impact forces 
significantly modify the buildings dynamic behavior. The separation required by the regulations 
avoids pounding; however, even in recent buildings, impact can occur due to not fulfillment of codes 
and seismicity underestimation. Given the importance of this issue, a significant research effort has 
been undertaken worldwide, and a considerable number of papers are available. The complexity of this 
field and this abundance of information might require a review task. This paper presents a summary of 
the theoretical developments, discusses the most common simulation software, provides an overview 
of the previous research, offers recommendations to researchers, and identifies research needs. 
 
Keywords: Seismic pounding, colliding adjoining buildings, numerical simulation. 

 
1 INTRODUCTION 

 
During strong seismic events, impact between contiguous buildings is relevant, since the huge 
collision forces significantly modify their dynamic behavior. In some occasions, the effect of impact 
might be beneficial, mainly in terms of interstory drift; conversely, in many other situations, pounding 
is detrimental, particularly in terms of absolute acceleration. Collapse and nonstructural damage of 
buildings due to seismic pounding have been reported. Collision can be avoided by adequately 
separating the involved buildings, and this gap is routinely required by the design codes; however, 
impact can anyway occur because of several reasons: sometimes code prescriptions are not fulfilled, 
some past codes did not oblige any such separation, and the seismicity can be underestimated. 
Therefore, seismic pounding of buildings is something to be taken into consideration. 
 
Collision between adjoining buildings can be classified into slab-to-slab and slab-to-column (or slab-
to-wall) impact; such cases correspond to aligned and unaligned slabs, respectively. The second type is 
by far more dangerous, since the impact of a rigid and massive slab on a column (or even on a wall) is 
most likely to lead to collapse. On the other hand, the first type is not free of danger and is 
considerably more frequent, since adjoining buildings with unaligned slabs are regularly avoided. 
Moreover, the numerical simulation of slab-to-slab impact is challenging, involving stress traveling 
waves, high-frequency behavior and significant local effects. This study focuses on seismic pounding 
between adjoining buildings with aligned slabs. 
 
Given the importance and complexity of this issue, a considerable number of papers, books and 
reports have been published so far. This review paper has the following general objectives: (i) 
presenting a summary of the most relevant theoretical developments, (ii) discussing the most common 
simulation software, (iii) providing a critical global overview of the previous research in this vast 
field, (iv) offering recommendations to new researchers, and (v) identifying new research needs. This 
paper is organized according to these objectives.

As outlined in the Introduction, collision between two building slabs is a complex phenomenon. The 
most natural approach is the classical impact theory, being based on the solution of the 3-D continuum 
partial derivative equations of motion (distributed-parameter models). In some geometrically simple 
cases, such equations can be solved exactly; the ensuing closed-form solutions can be useful when the 
required simplifying assumptions are feasible. Going to numerical formulations, sophisticated 
continuum mechanics-based models are available, but they are extremely time-consuming and are 
therefore unsuitable for extensive use in actual structures. Therefore, the use of concentrated models 
has been suggested; they are intended to be used with infinitely rigid slabs models. The simplest one is 
the stereomechanical [Goldsmith 1960]; the colliding slabs are represented by concentrated masses 
connected by a spring with infinitive stiffness and the plasticity is modeled by a restitution factor. The 
linear spring model is similar, although incorporates also a linear spring with finite stiffness. These 
two models can be considered as oversimplified; among the useful approaches, the simplest one is the 
Kelvin-Voigt model, also known as linear viscoelastic. It is the most spread formulation and is widely 
described herein, together with the modified Kelvin-Voigt model. Other more complex models 
(Nonlinear viscoelastic, Hertzdamp) are also analyzed. The Sears model is discussed as well; it 
combines distributed and lumped elements. 

 
2.2 Classical impact theory 
 
2.2.1 Axial vibration of an elastic bar 
 
This subsection presents an analytical study of damped axial vibrations of elastic uniform (constant-
section) straight bars; deeper analyses can be found in [Goldsmith 1960; Graff 1975; Stronge 2004]. 
Only waves progressing in a single direction are considered. Figure 1 displays a vibrating bar (Figure 
1.a) and a differential segment of it (Figure 1.b). In Figure 1.a, L is the bar length, E is the equivalent 
elastic deformation modulus, and A is the cross-section area; in Figure 1.b, N is the internal axial force 
(tension positive) and x is the longitudinal coordinate.

, where ρ is the density and 𝑚𝑚�0 is the part of external mass 
per unit length that is mobilized during the axial vibrations. In rather slender rods, plane stress 
conditions can be assumed. Conversely, in wide building slabs or bridge decks, the transverse stress 
waves cannot alleviate instantaneously the transverse compression; hence, the concrete behaves 
basically as confined, e.g. in plane strain conditions.  
 
Modal analysis can be performed by separation of variables, e.g. searching solutions of equation (1) 
given by the product of two functions depending only on x and on t: u(x, t) = φ(x) q(t). In that case, u”

. Since the first/second terms depend only on

. The undamped natural frequencies (ω) and the eigenmodes (given by 
φ) depend on the boundary and initial conditions. Noticeably, although this type of vibration is the 
most natural that the bar can experience, can be generated only starting from initial conditions that be 
compatible with its configuration. For instance, the impact between two colliding bars impose 
completely different initial conditions, since, at the collision instant, the velocity of all points of both 
bodies is equal to the one before impact, but the velocity of the colliding ends is different. This 
generates a discontinuity in the velocities that is not present in the modal conditions. Next subsection 
discusses more deeply this issue. 
 
2.2.2 Elastic impact analysis 
 
This subsection describes the internal behavior of colliding elastic bodies. The impact is assumed to be 
elastic; e.g. there is no energy loss. The analysis of the impact starts from the general solution of the 
equation of motion (1) by the d’Alembert method. That approach considers the change of variables 

given by x – c t = ξ and x + c t = ψ, where the constant c is given by 𝑐𝑐 = �𝐸𝐸
ρ�

 and represents the 

traveling waves (relative) velocity. Equation (1) becomes ∂
2 𝑢𝑢

∂ ξ ∂ ψ 
= 0 [Kharazian 2017]; its general 

solution is given by  
 

𝑢𝑢(𝑥𝑥, 𝑡𝑡) = 𝑓𝑓(ξ) + 𝑔𝑔(ψ) = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡) + 𝑔𝑔(𝑥𝑥+ 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡) (4) 
 
In equation (4), f and g are any pair of functions fulfilling the initial and boundary conditions. For such 
functions, 𝑓𝑓 �𝑥𝑥 + δ, 𝑡𝑡 + δ

𝑐𝑐
� = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥 + δ − 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡 − δ) = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡) = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥, 𝑡𝑡) and 𝑔𝑔 �𝑥𝑥 − δ, 𝑡𝑡 + δ

𝑐𝑐
� =

𝑔𝑔(𝑥𝑥 − δ + 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡 + δ) = 𝑔𝑔(𝑥𝑥 + 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡) = 𝑔𝑔(𝑥𝑥, 𝑡𝑡), where δ is a displacement; therefore, f and g represent 
constant velocity waves traveling to the right and to the left, respectively. Their shape depends on the 
initial and boundary conditions.  
 
Figure 2 describes the collinear impact between two elastic bodies with different length and axial 
stiffness, although with the same equivalent mass density ρ�. In Figure 2, v1 and v2, L1 and L2, and EA1 
and EA2, are the traveling velocity, length and axial stiffness of each colliding body, respectively. The 
mass of the rods is 𝑚𝑚1 =  ρ� 𝐴𝐴1 𝐿𝐿1 and 𝑚𝑚2 =  ρ� 𝐴𝐴2 𝐿𝐿2, respectively. It is assumed that L1 ≤ L2 but 2 L1 
≥ L2. Using a Lagrangian formulation, x is the coordinate with respect to the contact interface 
(right/left end sections of left/right body, respectively). F is the contact force in the interface between 
both bodies. A thorough description of Figure 2.a through Figure 2.h is given next. 
 
 Figure 2.a displays the colliding bodies prior impact. 
 Figure 2.b and Figure 2.c represent the beginning and the initial instants of impact, respectively. 

At impact, the velocity of the interface shifts instantaneously from v1 to vc (joint velocity, during 

  



the impact duration, of the interface between both bodies and the adjoining strained segments); 
this change generates a discontinuity. After contact, two stress (and strain) waves propagate 
outwards to the interface with constant velocity c. 

 Figure 2.d through Figure 2.f depict the peak and the second part of the impact. Once the wave 
reaches the free end of the bar, it reflects, and the end segment is being progressively unstrained. 
After-impact velocities v’1 and v’2 refer to the unstrained segments of the left and right bodies, 
respectively. 

 Figure 2.g shows the condition of the bodies at the end of the impact, e.g. when the returning wave 
of the left body has reached the interface and all its length is unstrained. The impact duration is 
equal to the axial vibration period of the shortest rod [Malhotra 1998]; noticeably, this interval is 
extremely short.  

 Figure 2.h refers to any further instant, when the left body travels unstrained with constant 
velocity while the right has some longitudinal vibrations.

The momentum conservation principle shows [Kharazian 2017] that 𝑣𝑣c =  
𝑚𝑚1𝐿𝐿2𝑣𝑣1+𝑚𝑚2𝐿𝐿1𝑣𝑣2

 𝑚𝑚1𝐿𝐿2+ 𝑚𝑚2𝐿𝐿1
; 

analogously, it is obtained that v’1 = 2 vc – v1 and v’2 = 2 vc – v2. The impact force F can be obtained by 
equaling the difference of momentum between Figure 2.b and Figure 2.d and the impulse; after some 
algebra [Kharazian 2017] it is concluded that 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚1𝑚𝑚2

(𝑣𝑣2−𝑣𝑣1)
 𝑚𝑚1𝐿𝐿2+ 𝑚𝑚2𝐿𝐿1

. The momentum conservation 
principle shows that, after the impact, the weighted average velocity v”2 in the right body is constant, 
being given by 𝑣𝑣2

´´ = 𝑣𝑣2 +  
2 𝑚𝑚1𝐿𝐿1(𝑣𝑣1−𝑣𝑣2)
 𝑚𝑚1𝐿𝐿2+ 𝑚𝑚2𝐿𝐿1

. 

 

The restitution factor r is commonly defined as the ratio between the post-impact and initial relative 
velocities between the colliding bodies; given that the right slab has some residual vibration, it can be 
defined in any of these forms:  

𝑟𝑟 =
𝑣𝑣′2 − 𝑣𝑣′1
 𝑣𝑣1 −  𝑣𝑣2

 𝑟𝑟′ =
𝑣𝑣"2 − 𝑣𝑣′1
 𝑣𝑣1 −  𝑣𝑣2

2.3 Kelvin-Voigt model (Linear viscoelastic model) 

 
2.3.1 Normal Kelvin-Voigt model 
 
The Kelvin-Voigt model is a zero-length element consisting in the parallel combination of a linear 
spring and a linear dash-pot, as displayed in Figure 3.a; d is the gap size, and k and c are the stiffness 
and damping coefficients, respectively. Figure 3.b displays the distribution of Kelvin-Voigt models in 
the adjoining pounding buildings. Figure 3.c represents a strained state of Kelvin-Voigt model; 
noticeably, if x1 − x2 > d, there is virtual penetration between both slabs.

Figure 3. Lumped Kelvin-Voigt models for simulation of pounding between adjoining buildings with aligned 
slabs 

 
The constitutive law of the Kelvin-Voigt model is given by 
 

𝐹𝐹 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑) + 𝑐𝑐 (�̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2)   if 𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 ≥ 𝑑𝑑 𝐹𝐹 = 0   if  𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 < 𝑑𝑑 (6) 
 

In past studies the Kelvin-Voigt model stiffness has shown little influence on the displacement 
response and has proven strongly dependent on many randomly varying parameters. Thus, only loose 
criteria for selecting it have been provided: studies [Anagnostopoulos 1988; Khatiwada, Chouw 2014] 
suggest using significantly higher values than the lateral stiffness of the colliding buildings, 
[Anagnostopoulos, Spiliopoulos 1992] recommends that the local periods of the mass-impact springs 
keep below the lowest translational periods of the pounding buildings, [Maison, Kasai 1992] proposes 
considering the axial stiffness of the floor slabs, [Watanabe, Kawashima 2004] refers also to the axial

stiffness of the slabs but check also higher and lower values, and finally, [Liu et al. 2014] proposes an 
expression depending on Hertz stiffness for spherical contact, and on maximum penetration. All the 
studies recommend that the stiffness of the Kelvin-Voigt model be considerably higher than the lateral 
stiffness of the buildings. 
 
In the distributed parameter model formulation (subsection 2.2) the impact force is constant during the 
collision duration; conversely, using the Kelvin-Voigt model, such force is given by equation (6). 
Therefore, it is not possible to obtain any exact equivalence between both formulations [Cole et al. 
2009; Cole et al. 2011]. 
 
Conversely to stiffness, damping is universally recognized as a more relevant parameter, significantly 
affecting virtually all the relevant response parameters; therefore, more attention has been paid to this 
issue. The physical meaning of the restitution factor is more obvious than that of the damping 
parameter; therefore, [Anagnostopoulos 2004] derives a closed-form expression of damping in terms 
of r. In that work, the influence of the structures of the colliding buildings and of the seismic 
excitation during impact are neglected. These assumptions are based on the higher stiffness and 
damping of Kelvin-Voigt model compared to those of the buildings, and on the input randomness, 
given the extremely short impact duration. After these simplifications, Anagnostopoulos performed a 
modal analysis of the ensuing two-degree of freedom system (Figure 3.a) and derived closed-form 
solutions of the uncoupled scalar equations of motion in modal coordinates. The first mode involves 
only rigid-body motion and has no stiffness and no damping; the natural frequency (ω) and the 
damping ratio (ζ) of the second mode are given by  

ω = �𝑘𝑘 
𝑚𝑚1 +  𝑚𝑚2
𝑚𝑚1 𝑚𝑚2

 ζ =
𝑐𝑐
2

  � 
𝑚𝑚1 +  𝑚𝑚2
𝑘𝑘 𝑚𝑚1 𝑚𝑚2

 (7) 

The aforementioned closed-form solution of the second mode is determined after their parameters in 
equation (7). Then, the impact duration (t) is obtained, and later the restitution factor is calculated 
from equation (5): 

𝑡𝑡 =
π

ω �1 − ζ2�
1/2 ζ =

−ln𝑟𝑟
√π2 + ln2𝑟𝑟

 (8) 

The left equation (8) shows that the impact duration is extremely short (as mentioned in subsection 
2.2.2), given that k is rather high. The right equation (8) shows that, if r = 0, ζ = 1 and if r = 1, ζ = 0.  

To summarize, this approach consists in estimating initially the restitution factor r, obtaining damping 
ratio ζ with equation (8) and then the damping parameter c with the second equation (7). The accuracy 
of this strategy can be evaluated by obtaining the actual value of r and comparing with the target one. 
This very simple and widely used model has been compared with more complicated solutions and has 
proven to provide comparable or even better accuracy [Mavronicola et al. 2015; Mavronicola et al. 
2016]. The work [Kharazian 2017] proposes an alternative formulation leading to a different 
estimation of damping parameter; better accuracy is obtained. 
 
In the seismic pounding between two RC building frames with 5 and 3 stories, Figure 4 displays time 
histories of the third floor impact force [Kharazian 2017]. Figure 4.a represents the full shaking 
duration, while Figure 4.b contains a zoom (time window) of the strongest collision. These results 
have been obtained with SeismoStruct [SeismoSoft 2016]; the impact is described with the normal 
Kelvin-Voigt model.

Figure 4. Impact force time history  
 
Figure 4 confirms that the impact duration is short (7.5 ms, Figure 4.b); this highlights the need of 
using extremely small discretization periods in the time integration. Another relevant remark is the 
high value of the maximum impact force. Figure 4.b shows that the time variation of the impact force 
is roughly shaped as a half sine-wave, this opposing the classical impact theory (subsection 2.2.2), 
which predicts constant force. Noticeably, the alternative formulation for estimating the damping 
parameter proposed in [Kharazian 2017] has been considered; this approach provides different 
duration for each collision, as detected in [Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2009a,b]. Conversely, the approach 
in [Anagnostopoulos 1988] yield uniform duration. 
 
2.3.2 Modified Kelvin-Voigt model 
 
The normal Kelvin-Voigt model is simple and accurate; its only inconsistency is a negative value of 
the pounding force F occurring just before separation. In the modified model, this conflict is 
eliminated by removing the damping term when the relative velocity is negative. Therefore, first 
equation (6) is modified as 
 
𝐹𝐹 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑) + 𝑐𝑐 (�̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2)   if �̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2 ≥ 0 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑)   if  �̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2 < 0 (9) 

 
The relation between damping ratio and restitution factor (equation (8)) is accordingly modified; two 
alternative expressions are provided: ζ = 1

π
1−𝑟𝑟2

𝑟𝑟
 and ζ = 1−𝑟𝑟

2

𝑟𝑟 (𝑟𝑟(π−2)+2)
. Then, the performance of the 

model is checked in a number of comparative analyses. The study [Mahmoud, Jankowski 2011] 
demonstrates that the results obtained through the modified model are similar to those of the normal 
one. The works [Komodromos et al. 2007; Kun et al. 2009a; Pant et al. 2010; Barros et al. 2013] 
propose other modifications of the Kelvin-Voigt model. 

 
2.4 Nonlinear viscoelastic model 
 
The nonlinear viscoelastic model was proposed by [Jankowski 2005] to simulate the structural 
pounding force more precisely by expanding the Hertz contact law into the viscoelastic domain. This 
model adds a nonlinear viscous damper to the nonlinear elastic model. As in the Modified Kelvin-
Voigt model, the damper is active only when the masses approach each other, and thus the uniform 
damping and tensile force in the linear viscoelastic model are removed; equation (9) is modified as:  
 
𝐹𝐹 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑)

3
2 + 𝑐𝑐 (�̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2) if �̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2 ≥ 0 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑)

3
2  if  �̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2 < 0 (10) 

 

The damping is given by 𝑐𝑐 = 2 ζ �𝑘𝑘 �𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑
𝑚𝑚1 𝑚𝑚2
𝑚𝑚1 + 𝑚𝑚2

, where ζ is the damping ratio being related 

to the restitution factor by ζ = 9 √5
2

1−𝑟𝑟2

𝑟𝑟 (𝑟𝑟(9 π−16)+16)
  [Jankowski 2006a]. The objective of this model is 

to eliminate the jumps that appear in the modified Kelvin-Voigt model at the beginning and the end of 
the contact; this objective is reached, but the transition from deformation to restitution phase of contact 

  



is not smooth. Such discontinuities are avoided in the Hertzdamp model presented in the next 
subsection.  
 
[Khatiwada et al. 2011] propose a modification of this model. The nonlinear behavior of the colliding 
buildings is represented by a perfect elastic-plastic model. 

 
2.5 Hertzdamp model 
 
This approach is proposed for pounding simulation in [Muthukumar, DesRoches 2006], although had 
been previously considered for multi-body systems [Lankarani, Nikravesh 1990]. This model consists 
in the parallel combination of a nonlinear Hertzian spring and a nonlinear viscous damper (dash-pot):  
 
𝐹𝐹 =  𝑘𝑘 (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑)3/2 + ζ (�̇�𝑥1 − �̇�𝑥2) (𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑑𝑑)3/2 if  

𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 ≥ 𝑑𝑑 
𝐹𝐹 = 0   if  𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 < 𝑑𝑑 (11) 

Equating the energy loss to the energy dissipated by the damper, an expression for ζ can be found: 
ζ =

3 𝑘𝑘 �1−𝑟𝑟2�
4 (�̇�𝑑1−�̇�𝑑2)

. Replacing r = 0 in this equation, ζ ≠ ∞ is obtained; for this inconsistency, [Kun et al. 

2009b] provided this modified version: ζ = 8 𝑘𝑘 
(1−𝑟𝑟)

5 𝑟𝑟 (�̇�𝑑1−�̇�𝑑2)
. Noticeably, this result, although being 

coherent, does not arise from any consistent theoretical base. Then, [Khatiwada et al. 2014b] provided 

the following relation: 1 + 𝑟𝑟 = 𝑘𝑘

2.6 Sears model 
 

[Khatiwada et al. 2013b; Khatiwada, Chouw 2014] propose using the Sears formulation [Sears, 1912] 
for pounding simulation. This approach is based on a series combination of lumped and distributed 
models, being initially developed for impact between circular bars with rounded ends. This model can 
overcome some limitations of the lumped and distributed ones. However, more experimental work is 
needed to calibrate the concentrated stiffness parameter. In its current version, the model does not 
include any damping; the theoretical development in subsection 2.2 might be useful. 

2.7 Concluding remarks 
 

The considerations in the previous subsections, highlight that, regarding the lumped impact models, 
the normal Kelvin-Voigt model is sufficient for most purposes; the modified Kelvin-Voigt model is 
more complex and does not provide any significant improvement. The models based on the Hertz 
contact law are not adequate, since that law was derived for elastic contact between balls; this situation 
being very different than the impact between slabs with straight ends. The Sears model looks 
promising, although further development is necessary. Concerning the distribution of the impact 
models along the building height, in most of the occasions, a single impact model in the top colliding 
level is sufficient, since impacts in the lower stories are rare (Figure 3.b); in general, such impacts are 
more frequent when the buildings are not separated (d = 0). In any case, it is recommended to check 
this circumstance before making the final choice. Regarding this issue, the work [Polycarpou et al. 
2014] presents a methodology where the “a priori” determination of the contact points is not required. 

One of the most relevant observations is the extremely short impact duration; this circumstance, 
together with the fact that the collision is mainly produced only at a single story, generates an 
important higher mode excitation. Therefore, the dynamic analyses require a short time step; this being 
emphasized by the nonlinearity of most of the analyses.

that these programs are not research-oriented, they have been extensively used for that purpose, given 
that they are user-friendly, robust and reliable. Since this type of software is highly result-oriented, for 
research purposes they near constitute a black box; therefore, research use requires deep knowledge on 
the employed code. It is estimated that the learning time is approximately one month for an average 
non-experienced user. Since these codes (Etabs, GSA, Midas, Perform-3D, Risa, Robot, SAP, Sofistik, 
Staad, Strand7, Tekla, among others) are rather similar; only the Etabs code [Wilson et al. 1979] is 
discussed here.  
 
Etabs. At a first glimpse, this software holds the capacity of simulating seismic pounding; however, a 
deeper review highlights several limitations. The most serious one is that, although the provided gap 
model can be series connected with the Kelvin-Voigt model, in nonlinear time history analysis, 
damping cannot be used in the model. Regarding the nonlinear behavior of the colliding buildings, it 
can be simulated with plastic hinges, both considering concentrated and distributed plasticity (fiber) 
models. If the behavior of the buildings near collapse is of interest, this software is not adequate, since 
not all the failure modes are adequately accounted for [Alfarah et al. 2017]; in other words, the 
provided capacity can be grossly overestimated. About the time discretization, any short time step 
(although constant) can be selected. Since it is not possible to modify the time step during the 
calculation time, nonlinear analyses are highly time-consuming. Another relevant limitation is that 
non-zero initial conditions cannot be imposed; this prevents, for example, analyzing the free damped 
response of any structure. In brief, this software is adequate for analysis of linear pounding, but is not 
for nonlinear pounding. 
 
3.2 Scientific codes 
 
This category includes software packages that have been developed inside Universities or Research 
Centers and, therefore, are oriented to teaching and, mainly, research. Noticeably, one of their main 
distinctive characteristics is that they are free for non-profit use. Although a wide number of codes 
exist (SeismoStruct, OpenSees, Ruaumoko, ZeusNL, IDARC, among others), only the first two are 
considered herein, being apparently the most spread ones. Given the research orientation of these 
programs, the “black box” part is significantly smaller than in the commercial codes. 
 
SeismoStruct. This program belongs to the family SeismoSoft [SeismoSoft 2016], having been 
developed in the EU Center (University of Pavia, Italy). Although this software is able to simulate 
pounding, some relevant limitations must be cared about, as discussed next. The “Link Element” can 
be used as the Kelvin-Voigt model by defining the behavior as “Gap_ hk”; noticeably, the stiffness 
needs to be defined for each of the six degrees of freedom, despite the gap is actually uniaxial. 
Regarding this, some recommendations are provided for the selection of the stiffness in the other 
directions; such criteria are empiric (e.g. in between 100 and 200 times higher than the axial stiffness 
of the colliding slabs), and no further justification is provided. Conversely, only a single value is 
required for damping. The Hertzdamp model can be introduced manually. In nonlinear time-history 
analysis, the influence of the gravity loads is automatically accounted for. Regarding the time step, it 
cannot be reduced beyond a limit imposed by the size of the output files; this being in some cases a 
serious restriction.  It is worth mentioning that in the newest versions (2016 Release 6), the output files 
corresponding to the previous versions cannot be completely read, thus preventing most of the post-
processing operations. On the simulation of the buildings nonlinear behavior, plastic hinges as 
basically treated as in Etabs, although there are more capacities. Although this program is not 
commercially-oriented, pre and post-processing is as user-friendly as in Etabs. As well, like in Etabs, 
non-zero initial conditions cannot be imposed. In a few words, this software holds most of the required 
capacities, although the relevance of the aforementioned limitations in each particular case should be 
accounted for. The learning time is about two months for an average non-experienced user.  
 

  



OpenSees. This program (Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) [PEER 2015] is an 
object-oriented software being developed by the PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research 
Center), belonging to the University of California at Berkeley. One of the main advantages is the 
“Open” characteristic, this meaning the possibility of programming the issues that are not available, 
and even modifying the existing ones. Nonetheless, there is a wide and active community working in 
and developing the OpenSees code, this offering extensive support and help. Another relevant 
advantage lies in the inherent scientific nature of this software, being clearly research-oriented. 
Conversely, pre and post-processing are not as user-friendly as in commercial codes; obviously, some 
parallel software can be used for this purpose. Going into details, although there is no any specific 
element for the Kelvin-Voigt model, it can be generated by combining spring, dash-pot and gap 
elements; unfortunately, this can be rather cumbersome. As well, the Hertzdamp model can be also 
created in a similar way. For time integration, any short time step (although constant along the 
calculation duration) can be selected. The required learning time is longer than for SeismoStruct. 
Quickly, introducing into pounding simulation using this software can be a long and hard task; 
however, this effort can pay in most cases. 
 
This paragraph discusses some comparisons between OpenSees and SeismoStruct. Both codes can 
process force-based or displacement-based elements; since in the first case mesh refinement does not 
improve the accuracy, a single element per member can be used. Conversely, in the displacement-
based elements mesh refinement yields better accuracy, thus finer meshes might be worth using. In 
general, OpenSees is faster than SeismoStruct, unless the option of showing the results during the 
analysis is deactivated. Another relevant advantage of OpenSees is its superior ability for describing 
the nonlinear building behavior; when pounding is expected to generate high damage, this feature can 
be conclusive. 

 
Figure 5 represents a comparison among pounding responses obtained using different discretization 
periods. The plotted results correspond to seismic pounding between two RC building frames with 5 
and 3 stories, respectively [Kharazian 2017]. Figure 5.a shows a time window of the impact force time 
history, while Figure 5.b displays the cumulated hysteretic energy at each level of the 3-story frame. 
These results have been obtained with SeismoStruct [SeismoSoft 2016]; the impact is described with 
the Kelvin-Voigt model.

Figure 5 points out the difference in the results for different discretization periods; this highlights the 
need of using extremely small time steps in the time integration. Noticeably, in any nonlinear dynamic 
analysis, there no specific criteria for selecting the discretization period; it should be based on 
examining the responses for progressively reduced values of ∆t. Regarding this issue, Figure 5 shows 
that the response for ∆t = 0.01 s is clearly different than those for 0.001 and 0.0005 s; since the results 
for these values are highly similar, it can be presumed that taking ∆t = 0.0005 s is sufficient. 

 
3.3 Advanced codes 
 

10 
 



 A. Kharazian, F. López-Almansa 11 
 

This group comprises some software codes (Abaqus, Ansys, Diana, Nastran, among others) that are 
commonly recognized as advanced; regarding structural analysis, their capacities include continuum 
mechanics-based approaches, and use of implicit and explicit formulations for performing time 
integration. The implicit strategy is commonly implemented in simplified programs, for both static and 
dynamic analyses; it consists basically in inverting the stiffness matrix to obtain the structural 
response. In linear static analysis this operation is performed only one time; in nonlinear static 
analysis, iterations are required. In dynamic analysis, these operations are performed at each 
discretization instant; then it is apparent that such analyses can be highly time-consuming, both 
because of the iterations and the need of considering short time steps to guarantee convergence and 
accuracy. The explicit strategy is only considered for dynamic analysis; the stiffness matrix is not 
inverted, but the mass one is, this operation being significantly cheaper in terms of computational 
effort. At each time step the acceleration vector is obtained in terms of the velocity and displacement 
vectors (at that instant) through the equation of motion; then the velocity and displacement vectors at 
next instant are determined by numerical integration and derivation. Even if the analysis is nonlinear 
(i.e. the stiffness matrix is not constant), there is no need for iteration; conversely, for a proper 
accuracy, the time step needs to be shorter than in the implicit case. In spite of this, the explicit 
formulation is usually faster than the implicit one because there is no need for repeated and 
cumbersome matrix inversions, and there are no iterations, this largely compensating the shorter time 
step. The explicit formulation can be recommended for pounding, since the time step must be short 
anyway, given the relevant participation of the high modes and the extremely brief impact duration. 
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that this formulation is dangerous, since the solution is always 
obtained, but it is unclear that it is correct. Noticeably, the explicit formulation can be also 
implemented in OpenSees. 
 
Although these codes are somehow research-oriented, the fact that they are more powerful than the 
previous ones implies also a bigger black box. Regarding the learning time, it ranges between three to 
four months for an average non-experienced user. 
 
The application of the two mostly used software packages (Abaqus [Hibbett et al. 1998] and Ansys 
[ANSYS 2016]) for pounding simulation is discussed next. 
 
Abaqus. There is one element for the normal Kelvin-Voigt model, being termed “Axial Element”. 
This element can be used in both linear and nonlinear analyses; noticeably, this possibility is a relevant 
advantage compared to Etabs and similar codes. Another interesting feature is that the discretization 
period can be variable along the calculation time. This option is useful for better convergence in 
nonlinear analysis; in pounding simulation, the time step can be significantly shortened during impact. 
Regarding this, the impact can be anticipated, and then the time step is automatically reduced. The 
analysis can be interrupted and continued after the previous final state as many times as needed. 
Concerning the simulation of the nonlinear behavior of the colliding building, all the common 
formulations (plastic hinges described with concentrated and distributed plasticity, fiber models, 
continuum mechanics) can be implemented. Some issues can be programmed and implemented by the 
user, although more limitations than in OpenSees apply. In short, the use of this software for pounding 
simulation is recommended. 
 
Ansys. The situation is similar to Abaqus; with all their relevant capacities being also active. The 
element “Combine 14” is useful for simulating the Kelvin-Voigt model. Currently (mid 2017), two 
versions of Ansys code are available, namely APDL and Workbench; they are better suited for 
research and commercial uses, respectively. Apparently, Workbench is being more promoted, with 
frequent updates and enhanced capacities. To sum up, the use of this software is also recommended.  
 
3.4 Concluding remarks 

 
This subsection summarizes the previous ones, aiming to provide advice on the most suitable software 
for each occasion. This decision is not straightforward, since several months are usually required for 

  



initial learning. As well, it is worth mentioning that forums, blogs, and other help sources are not 
always useful, since pounding simulation is a complicated and rather unusual task. 
 
The herein provided recommendations refer to pounding simulation using lumped models. Regarding 
distributed models, the axial vibrations (subsection 2.2) can be simulated by fine discretization of each 
slab using virtually any software. Obviously, in this case, the rigid diaphragm effect should not be 
imposed.  
 
Given the aforementioned major limitation of Etabs (damping cannot be incorporated in nonlinear 
time history analysis), its use is recommended only if the buildings behavior remains linear. 
Apparently, this limitation does not hold for Robot.  
 
Regarding OpenSees, its high reliability and “open” character are extremely useful. As well, there is a 
wide and highly active community of users and developers, thus leading to continuous improvements. 
 
The use of advanced software is only recommended either for previously experienced users or for 
those requiring high accuracy. The system requirements (RAM, CPU etc.) should be also taken into 
consideration. 
 
Regarding the use of user-developed software codes in pounding simulation, the main difficulty does 
not lie in the pounding itself, but on the nonlinear behavior of the buildings. Therefore, if such a 
software is available, the programming of any of the models described in section 2 is quite affordable. 
Noticeably, a considerable number of the published researches use their own codes. 
 
4 LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
4.1 Initial explanations 
 
This section presents a critical review of the technical literature on seismic pounding between RC 
buildings with aligned slabs. The discussed papers are grouped into several categories: observed 
damage, particular and parametrical studies, testing, input effect, influence of soil-structure 
interaction, mitigation, and review. Some papers on pounding between bridge slabs or between an 
isolated building and the moat wall are also discussed, given their interest for the subject under 
consideration. 

 
4.2 Observed damage from pounding 

 
A number of papers [Rosenblueth 1986; EERI 1989; EQE 1994; Comartin et al. 1995; Kasai, Maison 
1997; Weimin 2000; Anagnostopoulos, Karamaneas 2008; Doğan, Günaydin 2009; Cole et al. 2012; 
Chouw, Hao 2012; Shakya, Kawan 2016; Kagermanov et al. 2017] contain comprehensive 
descriptions of damaged buildings under pounding effect. These studies highlight the relevance of this 
issue, since damages are severe, being responsible for a significant percentage of the observed 
collapses. 
 
4.3 Particular and parametrical studies 
 
 [Anagnostopoulos 1988]. This paper describes a parametrical study on pounding amongst arrays 

of adjoining buildings. It is shown that the end structures experience almost always substantial 
increases in their response while for ‘interior’ structures the opposite often happens. This 
statement matches with the observed damage. 

 [Anagnostopoulos, Spiliopoulos 1992]. This paper investigates the response of adjacent 
pounding buildings. Collisions are simulated by means of Kelvin-Voigt models. It is found that 
pounding can cause high overstresses, mainly when the colliding buildings have significantly 
different heights, periods or masses. The authors show that the restitution factor ranges between 
0.5 and 0.75.  

12 
 



 A. Kharazian, F. López-Almansa 13 
 

 [Maison, Kasai 1990]. This paper analyzes the pounding between an actual 15-story building and 
a shorter and rigid adjacent building. It is concluded that the effect in the stories above the 
pounding location is significant. 

 [Maison, Kasai 1992]. This paper investigates the floor-to-floor pounding between two 15 and 8-
storey buildings. The influence of building separation, relative mass, and contact location 
properties are assessed. Apart from the remarks in subsection 2.3, it is concluded that the drifts in 
the tallest buildings are increased while are decreased in the shortest one, except in the stories in 
the vicinity of the impact. Regarding the building mass, the higher the difference, the more the 
adverse effect on the less massive building. 

 [Papadrakakis et al. 1996]. This paper studies the three-dimensional pounding between two or 
more buildings. The effects of various in-plan configurations are investigated for two real 
earthquake motions. It is concluded that pounding affects the stiffest structure and reduces the 
demand on the flexible one, particularly when the excitation is near the resonance of the flexible 
building. 

  [Pantelides, Ma 1998]. The structural response of SDOF models with either elastic or inelastic 
structural behavior is analyzed. Pounding is modeled as a Hertz impact force. For colliding 
structures with different periods, similar earthquake excitations can produce different responses. 

 [Jeng, Tzeng 2000]. This paper analyzes the pounding vulnerability of actual buildings in Taipei.  
It is concluded that pounding mitigation is necessary for a large number of buildings. 

 [Chau, Wei 2001]. This paper analyzes the pounding, under harmonic excitation, between two 
structures. It is shown that, as expected, the impact velocity increases drastically when the 
difference in natural periods between the two structures increases, being relatively insensitive to 
the gap size. The maximum impact velocity can occur at an excitation period either between those 
of the two oscillators or less than both of them. 

 [Karayannis, Favvata 2005]. This paper deals with the interaction between RC buildings with 
non-equal heights and with both aligned and unaligned slabs. The columns ductility requirements 
are bigger where the gap is smaller, mainly in the columns of the tallest building. 

 [Jankowski 2006b]. This paper proposes the concept of impact force response spectrum, e.g. peak 
pounding force vs. natural period. It is concluded that gap, natural period, damping, mass, 
ductility, and input time lag might have a substantial influence. 

 [Jankowski 2008b]. This paper presents an investigation on pounding between two equal-height 
buildings with different dynamic properties. Results show that the collision significantly 
influences the lightest and more flexible building, whereas the heaviest and stiffest structure is 
affected only negligibly. 

 [Bothara et al. 2008]. This paper studies the pounding vulnerability of actual buildings in 
Wellington. The authors show that pounding has become a major issue in many areas of the city. 

 [Pant et al. 2010]. This paper simulates pounding between 8 and 10-story framed RC buildings 
using the modified Kelvin-Voigt model. It is shown that the response of the 8-story building is 
amplified and that the response is more dependent on the input characteristics than on the gap. 

 [Boyer et al. 2012]. The impact between two SDOF models is analyzed. Different coefficients of 
restitution, gap distances and periods are considered. It is concluded that the impact probability 
increases as the gap decreases and the structural period differences increase. 

 [Chase et al. 2015]. This paper presents a pounding risk probabilistic study. It is shown that small 
gaps, different structural periods, great coefficients of restitution, and structural linearity lead to 
higher impact probability.  

 [Zhai et al. 2015]. Pounding between multi-story building models with bilinear behavior is 
investigated through dimensional analysis. The pounding effect is illustrated with three spectral 
regions (amplified, de-amplified and unaffected). Results show that the influence of the stiffness 
ratio is more significant for the lightest and more flexible building in the first spectral region; also, 
for the heaviest and stiffest building, the pounding force and the velocity are sensitive to the mass 
ratio. 

 [López-Almansa, Kharazian 2014; Kharazian, López-Almansa 2017]. These works present 
preliminary results of pounding between 3 and 5-story RC frames. Pounding is modeled using 
Kelvin-Voigt models. 

  



 [Elwardany et al. 2017]. This paper analyzes the effect of infill panels on the seismic pounding                                
of adjacent steel structures in series. The results show that the infill panels can significantly 
change the seismic behavior.  

 
The first remark is that pounding is serious, as concluded from subsection 4.2. Another relevant 
observation is that, in an array of several buildings, the end ones are the most damaged; therefore, the 
most representative and critical situation is the collision between two buildings. Regarding this, 
pounding is more severe when the buildings periods are different, given that the possibilities of 
encounters grow. Moreover, in that case, pounding behavior becomes chaotic, even for harmonic 
excitation. Another issue that worsens pounding is the difference in height, because of the whiplash 
effect of the protruding floors of the tallest building. Some researches point out that, in collisions 
between buildings with different mass and stiffness, the lightest and more flexible building is more 
affected. Concerning the gap influence, obviously, beyond a certain value, there is no pounding; apart 
from this, its influence is not intense. Finally, the buildings nonlinear behavior can be basically treated 
as a stiffness reduction. The influence of the input characteristics is discussed in subsection 4.5. 
 
Figure 6 presents a comparison between the maximum drift angles of a 5-story RC building frame in 
two conditions: pounding with a 3-story frame, and no pounding [Kharazian 2017]. The plotted drift 
angles are the average of the maximum responses for a number of seismic inputs; both negative (left) 
and positive (right) maxima are displayed. These results have been obtained with SeismoStruct 
[SeismoSoft 2016]; the impact is described with a Kelvin-Voigt model connecting the third floors of 
both buildings.

Figure 6. Maximum drift angle with / without pounding of a 5-story RC building frame 

 
Figure 6 shows that pounding has a significant effect, mainly on the left maximum drift in the stories 
near the impact location. This circumstance fits previous observations.  
 
4.4 Testing on pounding 

 
 [Van Mier et al. 1991]. This paper describes a series of experiments on the impact between two 

concrete elements. In all the cases, a sharp-ended striker impacted on a prestressed concrete pile 
with constant section. Detailed information on the impact force time-history are provided.  

 [Papadrakakis, Mouzakis 1995]. In this paper, shaking table pounding experiments between 
same-height two-story RC building frames are carried out.  Displacement, acceleration, and input 
energy time histories are presented. 

  [Filiatrault et al. 1996]. This work refers to shaking-table pounding experiments between two 
reduced scale 3 and 8-story steel frames. Among other results, time-histories of the impact force 
are provided. 

14 
 



 A. Kharazian, F. López-Almansa 15 
 

 [Zhu et al. 2002]. This paper describes shaking table 1-D and 2-D pounding experiments between 
two reduced-scale steel bridge decks and between a bridge deck and an abutment. Displacement 
time-histories are reported.  

 [Chau et al. 2003]. Shaking table pounding tests between two steel towers with different natural 
frequencies, damping ratios and separations have been carried out. Input harmonic waves and 
seismic ground motions are used. It is observed that chaotic motion develops when the difference 
between the two natural frequencies of the towers are large. Under sinusoidal excitations, the 
maximum impact velocity develops at an excitation frequency between both natural frequencies. 
Pounding amplifies the response of the stiffest structure but reduces that of the more flexible one. 

  [Rezavandi et al. 2007]. Two series of shaking table experiments on small-scale one-bay frames 
subjected to harmonic and seismic excitation are described. Techniques of reduction of pounding 
effects are presented: distance increase, absorbing material, and buildings connecting.  

 [Jankowski 2008a]. The accuracy of pounding models (section 2) is checked by comparison with 
an impact experiment conducted by dropping balls of different building materials. 

 [Jankowski 2010]. The author compares the results of two pounding experiments between 
elements made of steel, concrete, timber, and ceramic. The results show that the restitution factor 
depends significantly on the impact velocity and on the material of the colliding elements. 

 [Khatiwada et al. 2013a]. This study describes shaking table pounding experiments between two 
steel frames without any seismic gap. It is observed that the pounding effect is more sensitive to 
the difference in natural periods than in mass. 

  [Khatiwada et al. 2013b]. This paper presents experiments on pounding between two suspended 
reinforced concrete slabs. Time histories of the impact forces are reported. The experimental 
results are compared with the predictions of the most common numerical models. 

 [Khatiwada et al. 2014]. The same tests described in [Khatiwada et al. 2013b] are discussed in 
this work. Experimental results on peak acceleration, restitution factor and impact force are 
presented and commented. The effects of impact velocity, mass ratio and geometry of the 
colliding surfaces are investigated.  

 [Guo et al. 2012, 2015]. These papers describe shaking table pounding experiments between two 
reduced-scale steel bridge decks. Time-histories of acceleration, displacement and impact force 
are reported. It is observed that a perfect surface-to-surface contact cannot be easily achieved.  

 [Jankowski et al. 2015]. Shaking table experiments on pounding between steel towers in series 
are described. This study shows the influence of pounding on the behavior of structures in series.  

 [Sasaki et al. 2017]. This paper describes a full-scale shake table experiment of impact between a 
base-isolated building and the wall.  

 
Experimental results on concrete-to-concrete slab impact are rather scarce. Most of the researches 
highlight the difficulty of obtaining precise measurements, given the high-frequency motion during the 
impact; some studies suggest that accelerometers should be complemented with acoustic signal 
sensors and video recorders. Nowadays many open questions still remain. Noticeably, given the 
scarcity of experimental results in full-scale buildings, distributed-parameter models can be used 
instead, since they provide results that are closer to reality than those from the most simplified 
methods. 
 
4.5 Input effect 
 
 [Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2009a,b]. The pounding response under pulse-type and arbitrary 

excitations is analyzed. Concerning the pulses, it is shown that regardless of the maximum 
acceleration and the duration of the pulse, the response spectra are similar. The study confirms the 
existence of three spectral regions. The response of the most flexible/stiffest oscillator amplifies in 
the low/high-frequency range. The study shows that pounding structures may be most vulnerable 
to frequencies very different from their natural ones. The study also unveils that the dimensionless 
response exhibits an incomplete self-similarity with respect to the mass ratio. Regarding the 
arbitrary inputs, the study proposes input selection criteria and shows that the proposed approach 
reduces drastically the scatter in the response. 

  



 [Yaghmaei et al. 2012]. The effect of mass, gap, and damping on pounding response under near 
and far-field inputs is studied. Some exceptions to the common acceptance that the pounding force 
decreases with the gap increase are found. 

 [Efraimiadou et al. 2013]. The effect of multiple earthquakes on the collision between planar RC 
5 and 8-storey building frames is examined. 

 [Polycarpou et al. 2015]. The effect of the input incidence angle investigated. In many cases, 
pounding becomes more pronounced for excitation angles different from 0 or 90 degrees. 

 [Mavronicola et al. 2017]. This paper describes 3-D parametrical studies on the pounding effect 
on base-isolated structures. The study shows that the influence of the input incidence angle and the 
mass eccentricity is significant. 

  [Kharazian 2017]. A parametric study on the pounding response of 3 and 5-story RC buildings is 
conducted. Regarding the input influence, it is assumed that their most relevant characteristics are 
the importance of velocity pulses and the frequency content (represented by the soil type). 

 
These studies point out that the seismic input effect is significant. This remark is based on the rather 
chaotic nature of the pounding response and on the high diversity of the ground motion characteristics. 
A relevant conclusion is that any parametric study should consider the actuation of a wide and 
representative set of accelerograms. Their main features are: relevance of velocity pulses (near-fault 
effects), soil type, earthquake magnitude, distance to the center, and duration.  
 
Figure 7 displays time histories of impact force in the seismic pounding between two RC building 
frames with 3 and 5 stories, respectively [Kharazian 2017]. Figure 7.a and Figure 7.b correspond to 
different historic ground motions; one of them does not have near-fault effects and is recorded in soft 
soil while the other one has relevant near-fault effects and is recorded in stiff soil. These results have 
been obtained with SeismoStruct [SeismoSoft 2016]; the impact is described with a Kelvin-Voigt 
model connecting the third floors.

Figure 7. Impact force time histories  
 
Figure 7 shows that, although both inputs have similar Arias intensity [Kharazian 2017], the impact 
force histories are completely different. This highlights the influence of the input characteristics. 
 
4.6 Influence of Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) 
 
 [Schmid, Chouw 1992]. SSI is described with boundary and finite element solutions. It is 

concluded that SSI has a profound influence on the impact behavior. 
 [Rahman et al. 2001]. This paper studies pounding between RC buildings considering the soil 

flexibility. The pounding response is found to be highly sensitive to the SSI and to the 
characteristics and direction of the seismic excitation. 

 [Chouw 2002]. This paper analyzes the influence of soil-structure interaction on the pounding 
response of adjacent buildings under-source earthquakes. The results show that both SSI and 
pulses have a significant effect.

 A. Kharazian, F. López-Almansa 17 
 

 [Chouw, Hao 2005]. This paper studies the influence of the SSI and the spatial ground motion on 
the pounding of two adjacent bridge frames. The authors concluded that both issues should be 
considered. 

 [Naserkhaki et al. 2012]. This paper examines pounding between adjacent buildings with SSI. 
Results indicate that the underlying soil negatively impacts the buildings seismic responses. 

 [Mahmoud et al. 2013]. This paper examines the SSI effect on pounding between two equal-
height inelastic buildings. It is found that SSI decreases the drift, the impact force and the 
dissipated energy, whereas increases the acceleration. 

 [Madani et al. 2015]. This paper simulates and discusses the effects of pounding and SSSI 
between two adjacent steel structures. The study shows that this issue is relevant. 

 [Kharazian 2017]. A parametric study on the pounding response of 3 and 5-story RC buildings is 
conducted. SSI is represented by springs and dashpots; two types of foundation are contemplated, 
namely isolated and mat. 

These studies show that SSI cannot be neglected in seismic pounding simulation. 
 

Figure 8 displays a comparison between the pounding responses of two building frames with 3 and 5 
stories by considering and neglecting the soil-structure interaction, respectively [Kharazian 2017].

Figure 8 shows that the effect of the SSI is significant, thus confirming the conclusions of most of the 
previous studies. 

 
4.7 Mitigation 

 
 [Valles, Reinhorn 1997]. Apart from other contributions, this paper describes three types of 

elements for pounding mitigation: link, bumper, and damper. 
 [Ruangrassamee, Kawashima 2003]. This research shows the effectiveness of variable dampers 

in improving the seismic pounding response of bridges. 
 [Anagnostopoulos, Karamaneas 2008]. The use of bumper shear walls to minimize the damage 

of RC buildings is investigated. Results indicate that pounding keeps within tolerable limits and 
the collision walls will suffer repairable local damage. 

 [Guo et al. 2009]. This paper presents an experimental and analytical study on pounding reduction 
of highway bridges subjected to earthquake ground motions by using magnetorheological dampers 
with semi-active control. It is concluded that the dampers mitigate the pounding effect. 

 [Polycarpou et al. 2013]. This work describes the incorporation of rubber bumpers between 
adjacent buildings and proposes a simulation model.  

 [Takabatake et al. 2014,2015; Khatiwada et al. 2015]. These papers present an effective method 
for reducing the pounding damage. The method involves inserting a shock-absorbing material into 
the joint gap. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach, although some concerns arose.  

 [Naderpour et al. 2017]. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to estimate the required 
distance to prevent collision. The accuracy of the proposed formulation is numerically 
investigated. 

  



 
These investigations highlight the feasibility of using simple rubber bumpers for mitigation of seismic 
pounding between adjoining buildings as an alternative to the seismic separation requirements. 
 
4.8 Review 
 
 [Anagnostopoulos 1996]. A detailed review is presented. It is concluded that for buildings with 

similar height and structural characteristics, the pounding effects are limited to some local damage 
and to higher accelerations. Only when the buildings have much different masses, periods and 
heights, can pounding be a threat to safety. When the buildings masses are similar, the responses 
of the stiffest/softest buildings will be amplified/deamplified. Bumper shear walls are suggested. 

 [Cole et al. 2010]. Current methods of building pounding assessment are reviewed. Critical 
building weaknesses vulnerable to pounding are presented. 

 
4.9 Base isolation 

 
 [Komodromos et al. 2007]. This paper describes seismic pounding of isolated buildings with the 

moat wall. It is shown that accelerations are significantly increased, especially at the base floor. 
Higher modes of vibration are excited, thus increasing the drift in the superstructure. The impact 
model stiffness significantly affects the acceleration, and has less effect on the displacement. It is 
also concluded that high isolation flexibility may generate pounding vulnerability. 

 [Kun et al. 2009a]. This paper examines the suitability of the modified Kelvin impact model for 
simulation of pounding of base-isolated buildings. The conclusions are similar to those of 
[Komodromos et al. 2007]. 

 [Polycarpou, Komodromos 2010a,b,2011]. These papers investigate pounding of isolated 
buildings either with the moat wall or against adjacent buildings. The simulations reveal that even 
if a sufficient gap is provided, this does not ensure that the building will not collide with 
neighboring buildings. The use of rubber bumpers is considered. 

 [Masroor, Mosqueda 2012]. Experiments were performed to assess the performance of 
seismically isolated buildings, including pounding against a moat wall. The impact forces depend 
significantly on the gap size, the impact velocity and the wall flexibility; in extreme cases, 
pounding can induce yielding in the superstructure. 

  [Pant et al. 2012]. This paper describes the effect of pounding on base-isolated RC buildings 
excited with inputs containing velocity pulses. Given that the high uncertainty of the structural 
parameters of the isolator units, the influence of their upper and lower bounding values is 
analyzed. 

 [Barros et al. 2013]. This paper compares pounding of base-isolated and fixed-base buildings. 
The authors conclude that the largest impact force appears in the top story, and that most of the 
damage corresponds also to fixed-base buildings.  

 [Liu et al. 2014]. A linear impact model to predict the impact response of seismic isolated 
structures is proposed. The equivalent linear stiffness is theoretically derived. The effectiveness of 
this model is verified by comparing the numerical results with experimental ones.  

 
4.10 Bridges 
 
 [Malhotra 1998]. The theoretical results of the first part of this paper are used to analyze the 

pounding of segments of concrete bridges. The restitution factor is determined after recorded data. 
It is shown that pounding generally reduces the column forces, the large impact forces generated 
in the superstructure are not transmitted to columns and foundations, and pounding does not 
increase the longitudinal separation at hinges. 

 [Jankowski et al. 1998]. The aim of this paper is to analyze pounding between the superstructure 
segments of an isolated bridge. The results of the study show that pounding leads to either the 
increase or decrease of the forces acting on piers, depending on the gap size between the 
superstructure segments.

 A. Kharazian, F. López-Almansa 19 
 

 [Ruangrassamee, Kawashima 2001]. This research investigates pounding between bridge 
segments. The results are represented in form of relative displacement response spectra. 

 [Des Roches, Muthukumar 2002]. The response of multiple-frame bridges considering one and 
two-sided pounding is investigated. The relevance of the frame period and the ground motion 
characteristic period is shown. It is recognized that one-sided pounding amplifies the frame 
response of highly out-of-phase frames, mainly in short period structures; the two-sided pounding 
response has been increased in stiff frames. 

 [Li et al. 2012]. This research evaluates experimentally the influence of spatial variation of 
ground motions on the pounding behavior of three adjacent bridge segments. The investigation is 
performed using three shaking tables. Results confirm that the spatially non uniform ground 
motions increase the relative displacement of adjacent bridge girders and pounding forces. 

 [Marin 2014]. A modified Kelvin-Voigt model where frictional forces are involved is developed 
and implemented in OpenSees. This model is experimentally validated. 

 [Chanda et al. 2016]. This paper analyzes seismic pounding between bridge segments using 
multi-body dynamics. 
 

Given the big differences between pounding of buildings and bridges, the conclusions of these studies 
cannot be directly extrapolated to collision between adjoining buildings. The most relevant issues refer 
to numerical modeling. 
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 

 
This paper presents a review on the state-of-the-art of research on seismic pounding between buildings 
with aligned slabs. A summary of the theoretical developments is presented, the most common 
simulation software codes are examined, and an overview of the previous research is provided. The 
most relevant observations arising from this study are discussed next. 
 
Next list contains a number of recommendations to new researchers, scholars, and professionals: 
 
 The soil-structure interaction should be taken into consideration; neglecting their effects can lead 

to significant inaccuracies. 
 If general conclusions are sought, do not consider a single seismic input; conversely, a 

representative set of inputs shall be utilized. 
 To assess the pounding relevance, all the relevant response parameters should be examined: drift 

displacement, story shear force, absolute acceleration, impact force, absorbed energy, etc. 
 In the numerical analyses, it is important to pay attention to the software selection; the indications 

in section 3 can be useful. 
 In pounding simulation, it is basically suggested to utilize the normal Kelvin-Voigt model.  
 In the time integration, it is important to use extremely short time steps, given the high frequencies 

involved in the collision. 
 
Some research needs are listed next: 
 
 Given the scarcity of fully reported experimental results, additional testing should be performed. 

Such tests must provide comprehensive information on the buildings response during impact. 
 Regarding the numerical simulation, empirical criteria for selecting the time discretization might 

be extremely useful. 
 Concerning the pounding relevance, because of its complexity and chaotic nature, a considerable 

number of studies about their consequences are still required. 
 Since both distributed and concentrated models have serious limitations, developing the Sears 

model can be useful. Possible extensions are the incorporation of damping and the derivation of 
better strategies for estimation of the stiffness parameter.
