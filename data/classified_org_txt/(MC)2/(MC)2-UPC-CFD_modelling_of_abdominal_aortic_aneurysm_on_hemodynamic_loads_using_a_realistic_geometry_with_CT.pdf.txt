The objective of this study is to find a correlation between the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) geometric parameters, wall
stress shear (WSS), abdominal flow patterns, intraluminal thrombus (ILT), and AAA arterial wall rupture using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD). Real AAA 3Dmodels were created by three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of in vivo acquired computed
tomography (CT) images from 5 patients. Based on 3D AAA models, high quality volume meshes were created using an optimal
tetrahedral aspect ratio for the whole domain. In order to quantify the WSS and the recirculation inside the AAA, a 3D CFD using
finite elements analysis was used. The CFD computation was performed assuming that the arterial wall is rigid and the blood is
considered a homogeneous Newtonian fluid with a density of 1050 kg/m3 and a kinematic viscosity of 4 × 10−3 Pa⋅s. Parallelization
procedures were used in order to increase the performance of the CFD calculations. A relation between AAA geometric parameters
(asymmetry index (𝛽), saccular index (𝛾), deformation diameter ratio (𝜒), and tortuosity index (𝜀)) and hemodynamic loads was
observed, and it could be used as a potential predictor of AAA arterial wall rupture and potential ILT formation.

1. Introduction

Most of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) (about 90%) are
located below the level of the renal arteries and are known
as infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Infrarenal aortic aneurysm
is a pathological enlargement of the aorta in the inferior
thoracic area taking a fusiform shape and may extend into
the iliac arteries. The mortality of this pathology is high
(15% for ruptured aneurysms), and the current standard of
determining rupture risk is based on the anteroposterior
diameter. It is known that smaller AAAs that fall below the
threshold of 5.5 cm diameter may also rupture, and yet larger
AAAs (diameter > 5.5 cm)may remain stable [1–3]. However,
occasionally the AAA diameter is lower than 5 cm and an
unexpected ruptured is produced [4], in these cases, other
biomechanical factors [5–8], such asWall Shear Stress (WSS),

or geometrical factors [9–12] can play an important role in the
rupture of the aneurysm.

To estimate the AAA rupture risk, from a biomechanical
point of view (material failure), an aneurysm ruptures when
the stresses acting on the arterial wall exceed its failure
strength. According to Laplace’s law, the wall stress on an
ideal cylinder is directly proportional to its radius and
intraluminal pressure. Even though an AAA is not an ideal
cylinder, Laplace’s law still applies and with an increasing
aortic diameter, the internal pressure increases, and so does
the risk of rupture. The increase in internal pressure against
the aortic walls results in progressive growth of the AAA
diameter, and, eventually, this pressure may overcome the
resistance of the aortic wall resulting in rupture [1, 2]. On the
other hand, abnormal flow patterns and recirculation develop
in the AAA sac leading to the formation of the intraluminal

thrombus (ILT) [6, 13]. This phenomenon can provoke the
AAA stabilization and start a vicious circle inside the AAA
[14]. It is reflected by the interaction between the arterial wall
structural remodeling and the forces generated by blood flow
within the AAA [2, 13].Therefore, it is apparent that Laplace’s
Law is insufficient when investigating AAA collapsibility.
Rather, the aneurysm shape has a strong influence on flow
patterns, ILT formation, wall stress distribution (peak values
and locations), and consequently its potential rupture [1, 15].

The aim of this study is to analyze and to characterize the
effect of wall shear stress and the internal pressure together
with the main AAA geometric parameters (maximum diam-
eter (𝐷AMAX), length (𝐿AAA), AAA proximal neck diameter
(𝑑proximal neck), tortuosity (𝜀), and asymmetry (𝛽)) in order to
assess its potential rupture. Five patient-specific AAAmodels
were created from CT scans. A normal descending aorta was
also simulated to provide a comparison.

2. Material and Methods

Five patients with infrarenal aneurysms on followup at Tan
Tock Seng Hospital (Singapore) were included in this study.
The patients chosen for this study were selected with different
sized AAAs, in order to cover the different stages of this
pathology. All the patients participated in this trial analysis
volunteered and provided written informed consent of the
study. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. For
the medical image acquisition, a computed tomography (CT)
Somatom Plus Scanner (AS+) (Siemens Medical Solutions)
was used with the following parameters: 512 × 512 × 110, pixel
spacing: 0.785/0.785 with a resolution of 1.274 pixels per mm
and 5mm slice thickness. CT scanning was conducted while
the volunteer was awake in the head first-supine position
using an endoleak protocol. The CT covered the entire
abdomen and pelvis and was performed after the administra-
tion of intravenous Omnipaque 350 as IV contrast medium.

To characterize the structure of the AAA, the main
geometrical AAAparameters aremeasured: aneurysm length
(𝐿AAA) and maximum diameter of the aneurysm (𝐷AMAX)
(Figure 1(a)).The factor which assesses the length (𝐿AAA) and
the diameter (𝐷AMAX) of the AAA sac is known as saccular
index (𝛾) (1) [16]. If the saccular index is close to 1, the
aneurysm is saccular (spherical), but if it is close to 0 the
aneurysm is more fusiform. The deformation diameter rate
(𝜒) (1) [17] characterizes the nondeformed abdominal aorta
diameter (𝑑proximal neck) with the maximum diameter of the
aneurysm sac, 𝐷AMAX. A nonaneurysmal aorta is defined as

To evaluate the asymmetry (𝛽) [18] of the aneurysm (1), 𝑟
and 𝑅 are defined as the radii measured at the midsection
of the AAA sac from the longitudinal 𝑧-axis to the posterior
and anterior walls, respectively, as shown in the inset of
Figure 1(b). Thus, 𝛽 = 1.0 yields an azimuthal symmetry
and 𝛽 = 0.2 is an AAA for which only the anterior wall is
dilated while the posterior wall is nearly flat. The tortuosity
index (𝜀) (1) [19] is the relation between the actual lengths of
the centerline of the AAA with the length of a hypothetical
healthy aorta (Figure 1, center).

Based on these indexes and the wide clinical empirical
evidence, there are several criteria of the AAA grade. How-
ever, at present, there is no clinical consensus to use it. Table 1
shows the main AAA geometrical characteristics for each
patient in our study.

To create the computationalmodel, themedical data were
sent directly to a personal computer and stored in Digital
Imaging and COmmunications inMedicine format (DICOM
format). Figure 2 shows the segmentation workflow. The
region of interest (ROI) analyzed was segmented using the
three-dimensional computer-aided design system DIPPO
software [20]. The segmented area for each patient started
at the abdominal aorta (approximately in the infra renal
arteries) and extended down to the common iliac arteries
(Figure 2). The abdominal images were segmented from
CT DICOM images combining two different segmentation
procedures, thresholding and level set method (based on
snakes).Thresholding is a nonlinear operation that converts a
gray-scale image into a binary image where the two levels are
assigned to pixels that are below or above the specified thresh-
old value. The image snake operation creates or modifies
an active contour/snake in a greyscale image. The operation
iterates to minimize the snake’s energy which consists of
multiple components including the length of the snake, its
curvature, and image gradient [21].

After AAA segmentation, we get a 3D volume image
useful to create a 3D computational model to analyze the
blood flow behavior inside the AAA using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD). A mesh sensitivity analysis was per-
formed to ensure the accuracy of the simulations using steady
test. Depending on the complexity of the AAA model, a 3D
mesh consisted of 2.000.000–2.500.000 tetrahedral elements.
Using the isosurface stuffing algorithm [22], we have obtained
a smooth element and an aspect radio for the whole of the
meshes higher than 0.9 (ideal ratio = 1 for an equilateral
triangle). For the five acquisitions, the same medical image
protocol, image processing, and volumemesh reconstruction
were used.

3. Computational Fluid Mechanics Solver

CFD analysis was performed using BioDyn, a friendly user
interface based on the commercial software Tdyn [23]. Tdyn
is a fluid dynamics andmultiphysics simulation environment
based on the stabilized finite element method that solved
the Navier-Stokes equations. To characterize accurately the
blood flow in the AAA, a Reynolds number was calculated
for whole cases. Reynolds number is a dimensionless number
that determinates the dynamic of the fluid. Reynolds number

length given as the hydraulic diameter 𝐷 = 4𝐴/𝑃 for the
inlet velocity, and here 𝐴 is the cross-sectional area and 𝑃 is
the perimeter of the aorta. Because the Reynolds number in
inlet is low (<1000), we decided to use a CFD solver for lam-
inar flow considering steady, homogeneous, incompressible,
adiabatic, and Newtonian fluid. However, three-dimensional
flow features such as flow separation and recirculation might
trigger a transition to turbulence at lower Reynolds numbers
[9]. Based on a preliminary study [6], the effect of the
turbulence has been considered to be negligible. Following,
we show the Navier-Stokes equations (2)

−∇ ⋅ (𝜇∇𝑢) = 𝜌𝑓, in Ω × (0, 𝑡) ,

where 𝑢 = 𝑢(𝑥, 𝑡) denotes the velocity vector, 𝑝 = 𝑝(𝑥, 𝑡) the
pressure field, and the density (𝜌) is considered constant with

a value of 1050Kg⋅m−3 and dynamic viscosity (]), fixed at
0.004 Pa⋅s and 𝑓 the volumetric acceleration. The spatial dis-
cretization of the Navier-Stokes equations has been done by
means of the finite elementmethod (FEM), while for the time
discretization an iterative algorithm that can be considered
as an implicit two steps fractional step method has been
used. A new stabilisation method, known as finite increment
calculus, has recently been developed [24]. By considering the
balance of flux over a finite sized domain, higher order terms
naturally appear in the governing equations, which supply the
necessary stability for a classical Galerkin finite element dis-
cretization to be used with equal order velocity and pressure
interpolations. The inlet velocity waveform was taken from
the literature [25], andFigure 3 shows the pulsatilewaveforms
used. For inlet condition, a transient blood flow was imposed
in the descendent abdominal aorta. The velocity 𝑈 was
calculated for each patient in order to obtain a total fluid
volumetric flow rate of 500mL for an entire cardiac cycle.The
outlet boundaries were located at the common iliac arteries
where the pressure follows pulsatile waveforms as defined

in Figure 4(b). It is important to remark that these profiles
are not patient-specific data (MR velocity mapping was not
performed on these subjects), which can be a limitation of
this study. In further studies, a patient-specific velocity and
pressure profile will be used as boundary conditions.

Mathematically, the boundary conditions can be ex-
pressed as in (3a), (3b), and (3c). No-slip condition (vessel
rigid wall) was imposed on the surface of the arteries, (3a).
This choice is motivated by the fact that the physiological
parameters characterizing the arterial mechanical behaviour
of the AAA wall are not well determined. This approach,
however, reduces the discretization effort considerably, in
particular boundary layer gridding and the computational
cost although other approaches consider fluid structure
interaction (FSI) models [13, 25–28]. The inlet velocity is
assumed to fully developed their parabolic profile at the inlet
(3b), and time-dependent normal traction due to luminal
pressure at the outlet (3c) as

4. Results

Five models of infrarenal aneurysm with patient-specific
geometry were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics
in order to evaluate the flow patterns, wall shear stress, and
pressure over the aneurysm sac. Patients 1 to 4 had infrarenal
aneurysms whilst patient 5 is the control case. ILT was not
found in any case. The unsteady flow simulations were per-
formed through twopulsatile cycles to eliminate the influence
of initial transients. The results of pressure, stress, and flow

patterns are shown for the peak systole (0.2 s) of the second
cardiac cycle.

Figure 5 shows the flow patterns, velocity streamlines
inside the infrarenal aneurysms sac, and three cross-sectional
areas of the AAA (proximal, midsection, and distal neck)
for the five patients studied. Note that forward flow points
downwards and has a negative value in the adopted coordi-
nate system. The direction of the flow is from top to bottom
(direction 𝑍 negative). We notice that when the AAA has
asymmetry, the velocity streamlines correspondingly show
an asymmetric flow pattern inside the AAA sac. As shown
in [6, 7, 26, 29], the asymmetric flow patterns can provide
an insight into the mechanism that promotes the thrombus
renewal and possibly enlargement inside the aneurysm.
Rapid decrease in the velocity and regions of very high
(or low) hemodynamic stresses gradients may all contribute
in various ways to the vascular disease, primarily via their
effects on the endothelium. For example, platelets trapped
in recirculation zones tend to be deposited in areas of low
shear stress (stenosis) [14], since this and the presence of
vortices cause prolonged contact of the platelets with the
surface in the layer of slow fluid motion [6, 19]. This effect
can be observed for the pathological cases; however, in case 4
we observe a flow recirculation in the middle section and the
asymmetry is low. Consequently, the flow patterns of the
aneurysmnot only depend of the asymmetry of the aneurysm
but also depend of the AAA tortuosity. Details of the flow
patterns for the AAAs is shown in Figure 5 (cross-sectional
areas column). From the top to the bottom: neck section,
midsection (maximum diameter in the aneurysm sac), and
distal section. We notice that the tortuosity of the AAA
provokes an asymmetric flow patterns in the AAA sac. When
𝜀 is high, we observe that in the AAA proximal neck section
there is a strong irregular flow, causing also an irregular flow
in the AAA sac meanwhile, when 𝜀 is low, this effect does
not appear. From these findings, the greater the asymmetry
and tortuosity of the AAA, the higher the possibility of blood
recirculation, ILT formation, and a possible rupture. Thus,
the importance of geometry in the hemodynamic behavior
of AAAs is supported.

Anterior and posterior wall shear stress views are shown
in Figure 6, as well as the pressure on the aneurysm sac at
the peak systole. The mean WSS in the aneurysm sac of the
5 patients varied between 0.28 (case 5) and 12.72 Pa (case 4)
with a median of 3.52 Pa and mean of 5.74 Pa. The areas with
WSS values under the mean value have been classified as low

WSS areas (blue) and areas with WSS values higher than the
mean value as high WSS (red). Analysis of WSS maps for
all cases shows that the area of low WSS coincides with the
location of the recirculation areas (low velocities), and higher
WSS values are found in two regions: in the neck area and in
the corresponding areawhere the bloodflow jet has an impact
on the aneurismal sac. The blood flow jet has an impact
directly on the arterial wall producing higherWSS values.The
blood flow jet path is provoked by the proximal neck angle,
consequently by the AAA tortuosity (see Figure 5). These
WSS peak values do not influence too much in aneurysm
growth; however, in these areas a material failure could be
produced provoked by blood flow jet. It is interesting to note
that shear stress levels in all infrarenal aneurysms models are
higher than those in the normal aorta, where 𝜀 is low, which
has a fairly uniform stress shear spatial distribution.Maximal
values are found in the neck region, where 𝜀 is high.

Due to the increasing of the internal pressure, against
the aortic walls, the AAA diameter grows progressively, and
eventually it could be able to overcome the resistance of the
aortic wall with its breakup. This internal pressure is directly
proportional with the aneurysm diameter; thereby, when the
diameter grows, the pressure increases. High deformation
diameter rate (𝜒) index could indicate higher internal pres-
sure however, it should be noticed that the pressure also

depends on the tortuosity index (inversely proportional) and
the flow characteristics (see Figure 5). For instance, in case 4
even when the section diameter is large, the internal pressure
is lower than that in case 2. This is originated by a notably
pressure drop as a result of the vorticity and flow recirculation
(energy losses) in the cases with a high tortuosity index. This
effect also provokes a pressures gradient between the anterior
and posterior arterial wall in the interior of the AAA sac.
These internal high pressure areas inside the sac may indicate
the growth directions of AAA sac.

5. Discussions

The objective of this study is to use patient-specific AAA
models for correlating the geometric indices of the aneurysm
with the hemodynamic loads and, eventually, with the
potential risk of AAA rupture. From a mechanical point of
view, AAA ruptures when a maximum stress value over the
wall is exceeded. The stress peak refers to the mechanical
load sustained by the AAA wall, during maximal systolic
pressurization. In addition, it is known that wall stress alone
does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually
rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength. Its
value depends on arterial systolic pressure, the mechanical
properties, and the geometric configuration of the material

under study. However, the mechanism of arterial wall failure
due to (1) the AAA shape or (2) the pressure distribution is
physically different. The first is because of a punctual force
over a wall point, and the second is because a consequence

of a pressure distribution over the AAA wall. Based on the
AAA shape, several authors have proposed different criteria
for the AAA collapsibility; if the AAAdiameter is higher than
5.5 cm [4], the AAA may rupture or if the asymmetry index

factor (𝛽) is 𝛽 < 0.4, the AAA rupture is high [8]. In [10]
the AAA collapses when the deformation diameter ratio is
𝜒 > 3.3 or if the saccular index is <0.6 [11]. But depend-
ing on the index that is analysed, the surgical criteria are
different. More recently, the proposed AAA rupture risk is
related with the presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT)
[6, 26]. The intraluminal thrombus plays an important role
in expansion and rupture of advanced aneurysms through
directmechanical as well as indirect chemomechanical effects
[6]. Therefore, the AAA dilatation (and a potential rupture)
is dependent on the correlation between the geometrical
factor and the hemodynamic load. Consequently, alternative
methods of AAA rupture assessment are needed.

Themajority of these new approaches involve the numer-
ical analysis of AAAs using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) to determine the wall shear stress (WSS) distributions
and flow patterns in the aneurysm sac [5, 12, 13, 15, 16, 30].
In our study, we did not evaluate the patient-specific wall
strength or the effect of intraluminal thrombus. Neverthe-
less, the AAA cases analyzed provide useful information to
understanding how hemodynamic loads can affect aneurysm
growth and possible rupture. The pathological cases (cases 1
to 4) always present irregular flow in the aneurysm sac, no
uniform distribution of WSSs and great WSS values in the
curvatures of the aortic vessel. These anomalies are propor-
tional to the shape of the aneurysm and the angles of twist
that the aorta has. Asymmetric flow is always correlated to the
modified curvature of the vessel or when some enlargement
in the aneurysm is present (high saccular index (𝛾) and
tortuosity (𝜀) index). The AAA tortuosity could initiate ILT
formation and at the same time could provoke arterial wall
failure. In a situation where the tortuosity is high and the
saccular index is low, the WSS has more effects than the
pressure distribution in a possible AAA failure. However,
where the AAA is not twisted and the saccular index is high,
the pressure effect takes priority. In Figure 6, the highest shear
stress values are dependent especially on the tortuosity of the
AAA. The neck angle substantially impacts flow fields, caus-
ing strong irregular flow patterns in the AAA sac (Figure 5)
significantly influencing wall stress distribution (Figure 6).
The relationship between these indexes can provide an insight
into themechanism that promotes the thrombus renewal and
possibly enlargement inside the aneurysm.

6. Conclusions

To conclude, in this work, the wall shear stress, internal
pressure, and flow patterns of five patients-specific aortas
have been analyzed using a finite element method, and the
results have been correlated with the geometrical features.
Results from the patient-specific infrarenal aneurysmmodels
(cases 1–4) were compared with those of a normal aorta (case
5) and it has been found that the normal aorta has a uniform
distribution of the velocity streamlines, wall shear stress, and
pressure compared to that in the pathological cases. Maxi-
mum wall shear stresses in all infrarenal aneurysm models
are higher than those in the normal aorta and these values
are not directly related to the maximum aneurysm diameter,
providing evidence that a patient-specific aorta shape analysis

is necessary for a more reliable assessment of the rupture
risk of aortic aneurysms. Therefore, based on one or two
simple indexes alone, to determine the risk of rupture accu-
rately is insufficient. AAA rupture is a complex situation,
depending on themaximum diameter, internal pressure, wall
stress, asymmetry, saccular index, intraluminal thrombus,
and tortuosity, among others. Our results demonstrate how
the hemodynamic loads as simulated by computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) are influenced by the geometrical factors of
the aneurysm.
