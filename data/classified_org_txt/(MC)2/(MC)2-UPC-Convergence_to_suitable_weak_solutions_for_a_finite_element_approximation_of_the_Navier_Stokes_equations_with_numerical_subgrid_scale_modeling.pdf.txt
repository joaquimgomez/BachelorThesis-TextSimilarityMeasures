APPROXIMATION OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS WITH

NUMERICAL SUBGRID SCALE MODELING

SANTIAGO BADIA† AND JUAN VICENTE GUTIÉRREZ-SANTACREU‡

Abstract. In this work we prove that weak solutions constructed by a variational multiscale method

are suitable in the sense of Scheffer. In order to prove this result, we consider a subgrid model

that enforces orthogonality between subgrid and finite element components. Further, the subgrid
component must be tracked in time. Since this type of schemes introduce pressure stabilization, we

have proved the result for equal-order velocity and pressure finite element spaces that do not satisfy

a discrete inf-sup condition.

1. Introduction

Incompressible Newtonian fluids are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The existence of
solutions is known from the works by Leray [30] and Hopf [26]. However, uniqueness is still an open
question. The loss of regularity is related to turbulence [23], and Leray denoted weak solutions as

turbulent solution. Scheffer defined the concept of suitable weak solutions in [34] and proved a bound
for the Haussdorff dimension of the singular set of a weak suitable solution. This result was later
improved by Cafarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg [9], proving that this dimension is smaller than 1. This is
the sharpest regularity result so far.

Suitable weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations can be constructed by regularization (see,
e.g., [32]). More recently, Guermond proved that inf-sup stable finite element (FE) approximations
having a discrete commutator property also converge to suitable weak solutions, first for periodic
boundary conditions in the three-dimensional torus [21], and next on general domains and no-slip
boundary conditions [22]. The Fourier method does not satisfy the required assumptions, and it is still
an open question whether it provides suitable solutions.

The Navier-Stokes equations have a dissipative structure, due to the viscous term. The system
has a singular limit in the assymptotic regime as the Reynolds (Re) number, which is the ratio of
inertia forces to viscous forces, goes to infinity. The singular limit and the fact that the system is
indefinite complicate its numerical approximation. The first property requires to introduce some kind
of convection stabilization, whereas the second prevents the use of the same FE space for both the
velocity and pressure unknowns, the discrete system is unstable.

At the continuous level, the nonlinear convective term transfers energy from the largest to the
smallest scales, till reaching the Kolmogorov scale, where energy is dissipated. In direct numerical
simulations (DNS) the mesh needs to be fine enough to capture the smallest scales in the flow. How-
ever, this approach is unacceptable for industrial turbulent flows, due to the limits in computational
resources. In real applications, under-resolved simulations are needed. The smallest scales that can be
captured in these simulations are far from the Kolmogorov scale and dissipation is negligible. Thus,
one has to add so-called large eddy simulation (LES) turbulent models that add artificial diffusion
mechanisms. The concept of suitability and the fact that energy is dissipated at the mesh scale in a
physically consistent way have been related in [23]. Otherwise, an energy pile-up occurs at the smallest
grid scales, leading to instabilities.

Convection stabilization and turbulence models are strongly related. In this sense, many authors
have considered so-called implicit LES (ILES) methods that do not modify the original Navier-Stokes
equations but introduce additional numerical artifacts when carrying out the discretization [7, 17].
In the frame of FE techniques, one approach is to consider variational multiscale (VMS) methods
[27, 28]. The idea is to use a two-scale decomposition of the original problem and provide a numerically
motivated closure for the fine scale (see, e.g., [20]). A similar stabilization procedure can be used for
the convective term and the pressure term, leading to methods that do not require to satisfy a discrete
inf-sup condition. An alternative to traditional residual-based methods is to consider subscales that
are in some sense orthogonal to the FE space. This idea has been proposed by Codina [11], where
L2(Ω) orthogonality was used. This method involves global projections, which has motivated the use
of local projections (see, e.g., [5, 2]). The treatment of the time dimension in the subgrid model has
also been object of active research. In particular, the use of dynamic subscales methods that track the
subgrid scale in time have been proposed in [11].

Even though DNS is impractical in real applications, it is better understood than stabilized or ILES
schemes. The groundbreaking works by Guermond have proved that the FE Galerkin method leads to
weak suitable solutions in [21, 22]. However, the extension to ILES methods is not straightforward, due
to the introduction of additional terms to the numerical formulation. The analysis of these methods has
usually been restricted to a priori error estimates for smooth enough solution (see, e.g., [10]). Residual-
based VMS schemes are not amenable for weak convergence analysis, due to the proliferation of terms,
e.g., including new velocity-pressure coupling terms. However, enforcing the modelled subgrid scales
to be orthogonal to the FE space and considering the dynamic formulation in [11], the authors have
proved in [4] that the resulting scheme converges to weak (turbulent) solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations. For the same scheme, long-term stability estimates and existence of a global attractor
have been proved in [3]. Further, a very detailed numerical experimentation of these methods for
isotropic and wall-bounded turbulent flows can be found in [12], proving that these subgrid models act
as accurate turbulence models. Theoretical analyses supporting these results can also be found in [19].



CONVERGENCE TO SUITABLE WEAK SOLUTIONS FOR A SUBGRID FEM MODEL 3

In this work, we want to analyze whether VMS-type FE ILES schemes converge to suitable weak
solutions in the sense of Scheffer. We prove that subgrid closures that are orthogonal and dynamic
converge in fact to suitable solutions for equal order FE pairs for the velocity and pressure unknowns.

The outline of the work is the following. First, we state the problem and introduce the notation
in Section 2. The FE approximation based on the VMS-type ILES scheme is introduced in Section 3.
Section 4 includes some technical results in fractional Sobolev spaces. Energy estimates are proved in
Section 5. Finally, the convergence towards weak and suitable solutions is proved in 6.

2. Statement of the problem

Throughout this paper we follow faithfully the notation used in [25] and [22] so that the reader can
trace with ease the main differences between these two works and the one presented herein.

2.1. Notation. Let Ω be an open subset of R3. For p ∈ [1,∞], we denote by Lp(Ω) the usual Lebesgue
space, i.e.,

Lp(Ω) = {v : Ω→ R : v Lebesgue-measurable,
∫

Ω

|v(x)|pdx <∞},

with the usual modification when p = ∞. This space is a Banach space endowed with the norm
‖v‖Lp(Ω) = (

∫
Ω
|v(x)|p dx)1/p if p ∈ [1,∞) or ‖v‖L∞(Ω) = ess supx∈Ω |v(x)| if p = ∞. In particular,

L2(Ω) is a Hilbert space. We shall use (u, v) =
∫

Ω
u(x)v(x)dx for its inner product and ‖ · ‖ for its

norm. For m ∈ N, we denoted by Hm(Ω) the classical Sobolev-Hilbert spaces, i.e.,

Hm(Ω) = {v ∈ L2(Ω) : ∂kv ∈ L2(Ω) ∀ |k| ≤ m}
associated to the norm

‖v‖Hm(Ω) =


 ∑

0≤|k|≤m

‖∂kv‖2L2(Ω)




1
2

,

where k = (k1, ..., kd) ∈ Nd is a multi-index and |k| =
∑d
i=1 ki. Let D(Ω) be the space of infinitely times

differentiable functions with compact support in Ω, i.e. the space of test functions on Ω. Thus Hm0 (Ω) is
defined as the completion of D(Ω) with respect to the Hm(Ω)-norm. Fractional-order Hilbert-Sobolev
spaces are defined by the real method or K-method of interpolation due to Peetre and Lions [1]. Thus,

we consider two spaces: Hs(Ω) = [L2(Ω), H1(Ω)]s, for s ∈ (0, 1), and H̃s0(Ω) = [L2(Ω), H10 (Ω)]s for
s ∈ [0, 1]. Moreover, for s ∈ (0, 1), Hs0(Ω) is the closure of D(Ω) with respect to the Hs(Ω)-norm.
Note that the spaces Hs(Ω) and Hs0(Ω) coincide for s ∈ [0,

1
2
], with uniform norms [24, Th 11.1], and

the spaces Hs(Ω) and H̃s0(Ω) coincide with equivalent norms [33] for s ∈ [0,
1
2
). We also consider

Hs(Ω) = [H1(Ω), H2(Ω)]s for s ∈ (1, 2] and H̃s0(Ω) = Hs(Ω) ∩H10 (Ω) for s ∈ (1, 2].
The dual space of D(Ω), the space of distributions, is denoted by D′(Ω). Moreover, for s < 0, H̃s(Ω)

is the dual of H̃−s0 (Ω) and the space H
−s
0 (Ω) is the complexion of D(Ω) under the norm

‖v‖H−s(Ω) = sup
w∈D(Ω)\{0}

(v, w)

‖w‖Hs(Ω)
,

We use 〈·, ·〉 to denote the duality pairing. For s ∈ [0, 1
2
) ∪ ( 1

2
, 3

2
), H−s(Ω) coincides with H̃−s0 (Ω).

We will use boldfaced letters for spaces of vector functions, e.g. L2(Ω) in place of L2(Ω)d.
We will make use of the following space of vector fields:

ϑ = {v ∈ D(Ω) : ∇ · v = 0 in Ω}.
Related to the space ϑ, we consider the closures in the L2(Ω) andH1(Ω)-norm, which are characterized
by

H = {u ∈ L2(Ω) : ∇ · u = 0 in Ω,u · n = 0 on ∂Ω},
V = {u ∈H1(Ω) : ∇ · u = 0 in Ω,u = 0 on ∂Ω},

where n is the outward normal to Ω on ∂Ω. This characterization is true for locally Lipschitz-continuous
domains (see [36, Theorems 1.4 and 1.6] for a detailed proof). Furthermore, L2∫

=0
(Ω) (resp. H1∫

=0
(Ω))



4 S. BADIA AND J. V. GUTIÉRREZ-SANTACREU

is the space of zero-average L2(Ω)-functions (resp. zero-average H1(Ω)-functions ). Thus, by the real
method of interpolation, Hs∫

=0
(Ω) = [L2∫

=0
(Ω), H1∫

=0
(Ω)] for s ∈ (0, 1) (see [24]).

Let X be a Banach space. Thus, Lp(a, b;X) denotes the space of Bochner-measurable, X-valued

functions on the interval (0, T ) such that
∫ T

0
‖f(s)‖pXds <∞ if 1 ≤ p <∞ or ess sups∈(0,T ) ‖f(s)‖X <

∞ if p =∞.
Moreover, W 1,1(0, T ;X) is the space of functions f ∈ L1(0, T ;X) and d

ds
f ∈ L1(0, T ;X) such

that
∫ T

0
(‖f(s)‖X + ‖ ddsf(s)‖X) ds < ∞ and W

1,1
0 (0, T ;X) is the closure of D(0, T ;X) with respect

to the W 1,1(0, T ;X)-norm, with D(0, T ;X) being the space of infinitely times differentiable functions
defined on (0, T ) having values into X with compact support in (0, T ). Additionally, the dual space

of W
1,1
0 (0, T ;X) is denoted by W

−1,∞(0, T ;X ′) provided that X is separable and reflexive.
The Fourier transform of a function f ∈ L1(R;X) is denoted by

Ff(ξ) :=
∫ +∞
−∞

e−2πit·ξf(t)dt.

Let H be a Hilbert space and let S ′(R;H) be the space of tempered distributions taking value in H.
Thus, for γ ∈ R, one defines

Hγ(R;H) = {v ∈ S ′(R;H);
∫
R

(1 + |ξ|)2γ‖Fv‖2Hdξ},

where H is a Hilbert space. Additionally, the space Hγ(0, T ;H) is made up of tempered distributions
in S ′(0, T ;H) with the norm

‖v‖Hγ(0,T ;H) = inf
v∈S′(R;H)

‖v‖Hγ(R;H),

where v is the extension of v by zero off (0, T ) belonging to S ′(R;H).
Note that throughout this paper we use the symbol C (with or without subscripts) to represent

generic positive constants which can take different values at different places.

2.2. The Navier-Stokes equations. The Navier-Stokes equations for the motion of a viscous, in-
compressible, Newtonian fluid can be written as{

∂tu− ν∆u+ (u · ∇)u+∇p = f in Ω× (0, T ),
∇ · u = 0 in Ω× (0, T ), (1)

with Ω being a bounded, three-dimensional domain and with 0 < T < +∞. Here u : Ω× (0, T )→ R3
represents the incompressible fluid velocity and p : Ω × (0, T ) → R represents the fluid pressure.
Moreover, f is the external body force which acts on the system, and ν > 0 is the kinematic fluid
viscosity.

These equations are supplemented by the no-slip boundary condition

u = 0 on ∂Ω× (0, T ), (2)

and the initial condition

u(0) = u0 in Ω. (3)

The first authors dealing with the concept of weak solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations were
Leray [30] for the Cauchy problem in the whole space and later Hopf [26] for the initial-boundary value
problem in bounded domains. Particularly, weak solutions were called turbulent by Leray due to the
possible connection between the lack of regularity of weak solutions and turbulence.

Definition 2.1. A function u is said to be a weak solution of problem (1)-(2) if:

u ∈ L∞(0, T ;H) ∩ L2(0, T ;V ) (4)

An equivalent definition for weak solutions involving the pressure term is defined as follows.

Definition 2.2. A pair (u, p) is said to be a weak solution of problem (1)-(2) if:

u ∈ L∞(0, T ;H) ∩ L2(0, T ;V ) and p ∈W−1,∞(0, T, L2(Ω)/R)
and {

∂tu+ (u · ∇)u− ν∆u+∇p = f in W−1,∞(0, T ;H−1(Ω)),
u(0) = u0 in H.

We refer the reader to [15, Th. 1.3, Ch. V] for a proof of the equivalence between Definitions 2.1
and 2.2 with p ∈ D′((0, T )× Ω), that can easily be extended to p ∈ W−1,∞(0, T ;L2(Ω)/R), by using
de Rham’s Lemma in [35, Lm. 2].

The two previous definitions of weak solutions can be proved for Ω being a bounded, Lipschitzian
domain, and f ∈ L2(0, T ;H−1(Ω)) only. The weak solution that will be proved in this paper requires
Ω to be, for instance, convex, and f ∈ L2(0, T + 1;H−1(Ω)) ∩ Lp(0, T + 1;Lq(Ω)), with p ∈ [1, 2] and
q ∈ [1, 3

] satisfying 2

q

Definition 2.3. A pair (u, p) is said to be a weak solution of problem (1)-(2) if:

Moreover, the energy inequality

Scheffer [34] introduced the definition of suitable weak solutions so as to prove a partial regularity
theorem. Afterwards, Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg [9] improved Scheffer’s results, and F.-H. Lin
[31] simplified the proofs of the results in [9].

3. Finite element approximation

3.1. Hypotheses. Throughout this paper we will assume the following hypotheses:

(H1) Let Ω be a connected, bounded, open subset of R3 having a polyhedral boundary such that
there exist v ∈ V ∩H2(Ω) and p ∈ H1∫

=0
(Ω) satisfying

−∆v +∇p = g in Ω,
∇ · v = 0 in Ω.

(H2) Consider {Th}h>0 to be a shape-regular and quasi-uniform family of simplicial and conforming
meshes of Ω such that Ω = ∪K∈ThK with h = maxK∈Th hK where hK = diamK.

(H3) Let {W h}h>0 and {Qh}h>0 be two families of finite-element spaces associated with {Th}h>0
such that W h ⊂H10(Ω) and Qh ⊂ H1∫ =0(Ω). Moreover, the finite-element spaces are required
to satisfy the following conditions. Let πW h : L

2(Ω) → W h and πQh : L
2(Ω) → Qh be

the orthogonal projections onto W h and Qh, respectively, with respect to the L
2(Ω)-inner

product. Furthermore, we denote π⊥W h(·) := (·)− πW h(·) and π
⊥
Qh

(·) := (·)− πQh(·).
(a) There exists a constant Cinv > 0, independent of h, such that, for all wh ∈W h,

‖wh‖L∞(Ω) ≤ Cinvh−
3
k ‖wh‖Lk(Ω) (6)

and

‖∇wh‖Lk(Ω) ≤ Cinvh
−1‖wh‖Lk(Ω) (7)

for k ∈ [2,∞],

‖wh‖H1(Ω) ≤ Cinvh
−1+s‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω) (8)

for each s ∈ [0, 1], and

‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω) ≤ Cinvh
−s‖wh‖ and ‖wh‖ ≤ Cinvh−s‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω) (9)

for s ∈ [0, 1].
(b) There exists a constant Cst(s) > 0, independent of h, such that, for s ∈ [0, 32 ),

‖πW hw‖H̃s0(Ω) ≤ Cst(s)‖w‖H̃s0(Ω) for all w ∈ H̃
s

0(Ω), (10)

(c) There exists a constant Cint > 0, independent of h, such that, for all l and s, satisfying
0 ≤ l ≤ min{1, s} and l ≤ s ≤ 2, there holds

‖π⊥W hw‖H̃l0(Ω) ≤ Cinth

and

‖π⊥Qhq‖Hl(Ω) ≤ Cinth

(d) There exists Ccom > 0, independent of h, such that, for 0 ≤ l ≤ m ≤ 1 and ϕ ∈W
2,∞
0 (Ω),

‖π⊥W h(ϕwh)‖Hl(Ω) ≤ Ch

and

‖π⊥Qh(ϕqh)‖Hl(Ω) ≤ Ch
1+m−l‖qh‖Hm(Ω)‖ϕ‖Wm+1,∞0 (Ω) for all qh ∈ Qh. (14)

(H4) Let u0 ∈ V and f ∈ L2(0, T + 1;H−1(Ω)) ∩ Lp(0, T + 1;Lq(Ω)), with p ∈ [1, 2] and q ∈ [1, 32 ]
satisfying 2

p

q
= 4.

Hypothesis (H1) is ensured for domains having a C1,1 boundary or being a convex polygon (cf. [29]
or [18]) or polyhedron (cf. [13] ), with continuous dependence on f .

Hypothesis (H3) is extremely flexible and allows equal-order finite-element spaces for velocity and
pressure. For instance, let Pk(K) be the set of piecewise polynomial functions of degree less than or



CONVERGENCE TO SUITABLE WEAK SOLUTIONS FOR A SUBGRID FEM MODEL 7

equal to k on K being a tetrahedra. Thus the space of continuous, piecewise polynomial functions of
degree less than or equal to k on a mesh Th is denoted as

Xh =
{
vh ∈ C0(Ω) : vh|K ∈ Pk(K), ∀K ∈ Th

}
,

We choose the following continuous finite-element spaces

W h = Xh ∩H10(Ω) and Qh = Xh ∩ L
2∫

=0(Ω),

for approximating velocity and pressure, respectively.
The shape-regular and quasi-uniform properties of {Th}h>0 assumed in (H2) suffice to ensure the

properties of (H3)(a). We recommend the books [8, Sec. 4.5 ] and [14, Sec. 1.7] for a proof of (6) and
(7), Appendix A for a proof of (8), and [16] for a proof of (9). Moreover, the error estimates stated in
(H3) make use of (H2) as well (see [25, Lm A.3, Rm 2.1] for a proof).

The local approximation properties for the orthogonal projection operators πW h and πQh guarantee
hypothesis (H4). The reader is referred to [6].

Remark 3.1. Let p and q be as in (H4). We know from Sobolev’s embeddings that H̃
s

0(Ω) is embedded

in Lq
′
(Ω), where 1

q′

Hr(R;H) is embedded in Lp
′
(R;H), where 1

p

with H being a Hilbert space;

hence Lp(R;H) is embedded in H−r(R;H) . Let f be the extension of f outside [0, T ] as zero. Then,
by Hausdorff-Young’s inequality for the Fourier transform, we have

‖Ff‖
H−r(R;H̃

−s
0 (Ω))

≤ C‖Ff‖Lp′ (R;Lq(Ω)) ≤ C‖f‖Lp(R;Lq(Ω)) = C‖f‖Lp(0,T ;Lq(Ω)). (15)

Therefore,

f ∈ H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω)) (16)

As a reference for further development, it is well to point out, here, the conditions for p, q, s and r̄:

(C) Let s = 3( 1

) and r̄ = 1

be defined for p and q as in (H4).

3.2. The discrete problem. Find uh ∈ H1(0, T ;W h), ph ∈ L2(0, T ;Qh) and ũh ∈ H1(0, T ; W̃ h)
such that, for all (vh, ṽh, qh) ∈W h × W̃ h ×Qh,{

(∂tuh,vh) + b(uh,uh,vh) + ν(∇uh,∇vh)
−(ph,∇ · vh)− b(uh,vh, ũh) = (fh,vh),

with Cs and Cc being algorithmic positive constants, and fh ∈W h is defined by duality as (fh,wh) =
〈f ,wh〉, for all wh ∈W h. Let us define

b(uh,vh,wh) = 〈N (uh,vh),wh〉,
where N (uh,vh) = (uh · ∇)vh + 12 (∇ · uh)vh.

Let {ψi}i=1,...,nu be a basis of W h and let {ψi}i=1,...,np be a basis of Qh, where nu and np denote
the space dimension for W h and Qh, respectively. Thus, one defines

W̃ h = span{π⊥W h(N (φi,φj)), π

(∇φk)},

which is a non-conforming approximation space of V .
The initialization of the discrete problem can be obtained by the following projection problem: find

(u0h,vh)− (ξh,∇ · vh) = (u0,vh), for all vh ∈ V h,
(ũ0h, ṽ) + (∇ξh, ṽ) = (u0, ṽh), for all ṽh ∈ Ṽ h,

(∇ · u0h, qh)− (ũ0h,∇qh) = 0, for all qh ∈ Qh.
(18)

3.3. Discrete operators. This subsection is devoted to introducing the discrete operators that are
used throughtout this paper.

Firstly, we will consider a conforming and non-conforming approximation of the Laplace operator

−∆ : H̃
2

0(Ω)→ L
2(Ω). The non-conforming approximation is based on a stabilizing technique.

Consider −∆h : H10(Ω)→W h to be the discrete Laplacian operator defined as:
−(∆hw, w̄h) = (∇wh,∇w̄h) for all w̄h ∈W h.

The restriction of this operator −∆h to W h ⊂ H10(Ω) gives a self-adjoint, positive-definite operator.
Therefore, we are allowed to define the fractional power of −∆h, say (−∆h)s, for all s ∈ R, by the
Hilbert-Schmidt theorem. The domain of definition of (−∆h)s is D((−∆h)s) ≡W h since dimW h <
∞. Hence, W sh makes reference to W h equipped with the Hilbert norm

‖wh‖W s
h

= ((−∆h)
s
2wh, (−∆h)

s
2wh)

1
2 .

The family {W sh}s∈R is a scale of Hilbert spaces with respect to the real method of interpolation.
Analogously, consider −∆? : W ? →W ? to be the stabilized discrete Laplacian operator defined as

−(∆?w?, w̄?) = (∇πW hw?,∇πW hw̄?) + h
−2(π⊥hw?, π

⊥
h w̄?) for all w̄? ∈W ?.

It is easy to see that −∆?w? = −πW h∆?w?−π
⊥
W h

∆?w? = −∆hπW hw?−h
−2π⊥W hw?. We have that

−∆? is self-adjoint and positive-definite. Therefore, we are also allowed to define the fractional power
of −∆?, say (−∆?)s, for all s ∈ R, by the Hilbert-Schmidt theorem. Thus, W s? is W ? equipped with
the Hilbert norm

‖w?‖W s? = ((−∆?)
s
2w?, (−∆?)

s
2w?).

Secondly, we will consider a non-conforming approximation of the Stokes operator A := P (−∆) :
V ∩H2(Ω)→H where P is the Leray-Helmholtz projector operator.

Let A? : V ? → V ? be defined as
(A?v?, v̄?) = (∇πW hv?,∇πW h v̄?) + h

−2(π⊥W hv?, π
⊥
W h
v̄?) for all v̄? ∈ V ?.

Equivalently, one can write A? = πW hA? + π
⊥
W h

A? := Ah + Ãh satisfying


(Ahv?,wh) + (∇rh,wh) = (∇πW hv?,∇wh) for all wh ∈W h,
(Ahv?,∇qh) + (Ãhv?,∇qh) = 0 for all qh ∈ Qh,

(Ãhv?, w̃h) + (∇rh, w̃h) = h−2(π⊥W hv?, w̃h) for all w̃h ∈ W̃ h.
(19)

Again, A? is a self-adjoint, positive-definite operator. Therefore, the fractional power of A?, say A
s
?,

is well-defined for all s ∈ R. Moreover, V s? denotes V ? equipped with the Hilbert norm

‖v?‖V s? = (A
s
2
? v?, A

s

? v?)

1
2 .

The family {V s?}s∈R is a scale of Hilbert space with respect to the real method of interpolation.
Next we will consider a non-conforming approximation of the Leray-Helmholtz projection operator.

Let P? : L
2(Ω)→ V ? be defined as

(P?v, v̄?) = (v, v̄?) for all v̄? ∈ V ?.

Equivalently, one can write P? = πW hP? + π
⊥
W h

P? := Ph + P̃h satisfying


(Phv,wh) + (∇rh,wh) = (πW hv,wh) for all wh ∈W h
(Phv,∇qh) + (P̃hv,∇qh) = 0 for all qh ∈ Qh,

(P̃hv, w̃h) + (∇rh, w̃h) = (π⊥W hv, w̃h) for all w̃h ∈ W̃ h.
(20)

Finally, we define the stabilized Ritz projection operator onto V ?. Let R? : H

(∇Rhv,∇wh) + (∇rh,wh) = (∇πW hv,∇wh) for all wh ∈W h
(Rhv,∇qh) + (R̃hv,∇qh) = 0 for all qh ∈ Qh,

h−2(R̃hv, w̃h) + (∇rh, w̃h) = h−2(π⊥W hv, w̃h) for all w̃h ∈ W̃ h.
(21)

4. Technical preliminary results

This section is mainly devote to some technical results concerning equivalence between norms and
inf-sup conditions in fractional-order Sobolev spaces.

Lemma 4.1. Suppose that conditions (H1)-(H3) hold. Then there exist two positive constants c, C
such that, for all s ∈ R,

c(‖wh‖W s
h

+ h−s‖w̃h‖) ≤ ‖w?‖W s? ≤ C(‖wh‖W sh + h
−s‖w̃h‖), (22)

for all w? = wh + w̃h ∈W ?.

Proof. The proof follows by observing that (−∆?w?)s = (−∆πW hw?)
s + h−sπ⊥W hw̃? for all w?.

�

Corollary 4.2. Suppose that conditions (H1)-(H3) hold. Then there exist two positive constants c, C
such that, for all s ∈ (− 3

2
, 3

2
),

c(‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω) + h
−s‖w̃h‖) ≤ ‖w?‖W s? ≤ C(‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω) + h

−s‖w̃h‖), (23)

for all w? = wh + w̃h ∈W ?.

Proof. The proof is based on the result of [25, Lemma 2.2]:

c‖wh‖H̃s0 ≤ ‖wh‖W sh ≤ C‖wh‖H̃s0 for all wh ∈W h.

with s ∈ (− 3
2
, 3

2
). �

In the next lemma, we prove the stability of the stabilized discrete Leray-Helmholtz operator P? =
Ph + P̃h.

Lemma 4.3. Assume that conditions (H1)-(H3) are satisfied. Then there exists a positive constant
C, independent of h, such that, for all s ∈ [0, 1

2
),

‖Phv‖H̃s0(Ω) + h
−s‖P̃hv‖ ≤ C‖v‖H̃s0(Ω) for all v ∈ H̃

s

0(Ω), (24)

where P? = Ph + P̃h is the L
2(Ω)-orthogonal projection operator onto V ?.

Proof. Let v ∈ H̃
s

0(Ω). Then, by the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, there exists r ∈ H1∫ =0(Ω) such
that

v = Pv +∇r,
whose variational formulation reads as:{

(Pv, v̄) + (∇r, v̄) = (v, v̄) for all v̄ ∈ L2(Ω),
(v,∇q) = 0 for all H1∫ =0(Ω), (25)

Note that problem (20) is the stabilized discrete counterpart of (25). From [16, Chapter II, Theorem
1.1], we get

‖P?v − Pv‖+ ‖∇rh −∇r‖ ≤ C( inf
w?∈W ?

‖Pv −w?‖+ inf
qh∈Qh

‖∇r −∇qh‖). (26)



10 S. BADIA AND J. V. GUTIÉRREZ-SANTACREU

Using the fact that P? = Ph + P̃h with Ph and P̃h being L
2(Ω)-orthogonal by definition, we have

‖P?v − Pv‖2 = ‖Phv − Pv‖2 + ‖P̃hv‖2 − 2(Pv, P̃hv)
= ‖Phv − Pv‖2 + ‖P̃hv‖2 − 2(Pv − πW hPv, P̃hv)
≥ ‖Phv − Pv‖2 + ‖P̃hv‖2 − 2‖Pv − πW hPv‖

2 − 1
2
‖P̃hv‖2

= ‖Phv − Pv‖2 + 12‖P̃hv‖
2 − 2‖Pv − πW hPv‖

2.

Inserting this back into (26), we obtain

‖Phv − Pv‖+ ‖∇rh −∇r‖+ ‖P̃hv‖ ≤ C( inf
wh∈W h

‖Pv −wh‖+ inf
qh∈Qh

‖∇r −∇qh‖).

From (11) and (12), we find that

‖Phv − Pv‖+ ‖P̃hv‖ ≤ Chs‖v‖H̃s0(Ω), (27)

and

h−s‖P̃hv‖ ≤ C‖v‖H̃s0(Ω). (28)

In view of (9), (10), (11) and (27), we write

‖Phv‖H̃s0(Ω) ≤ ‖Phv − πW hPv‖Hs0(Ω) + ‖πW hPhv‖H̃s0(Ω)
≤ Ch−s‖Phv − πW hPv‖+ C‖Pv‖H̃s0(Ω)
≤ Ch−s(‖Phv − Pv‖+ ‖Pv − πW hPv‖) + C‖Pv‖H̃s0(Ω)
≤ C‖v‖H̃s0(Ω).

(29)

In the last line we have made use of the inequality ‖Pv‖Hs0(Ω) ≤ C‖v‖H̃s0(Ω) for all s ∈ [0,
1
2
). For a

proof, see [25, Lemma 1.1]. Also see [25, Remark 3.1] for an explanation of the restriction of s ∈ [0, 1
2
).

Finally, the proof follows by combining (28) and (29). �

As a consequence of Lemma 4.3, we immediately obtain the following.

Corollary 4.4. Assume that conditions (H1)-(H3) hold. Then there exists a positive constant C,
independent of h, such that, for all s ∈ [0, 1

2
),

‖P?w?‖W s? ≤ C‖w?‖W s? for all w? ∈W ?, (30)

where P? = Ph + P̃h is the L
2(Ω)-orthogonal projection operator onto V ?.

Proof. Let w? ∈W ? such that w? = wh + w̃h. Take v = wh in (24) to get

‖Phwh‖H̃s0(Ω) ≤ C‖wh‖H̃s0(Ω). (31)

Next, select v = w̃h in (20). Now, pick wh = Phw̃h, qh = rh, and w̃h = P̃hw̃h to obtain

‖Phw̃h‖2 +
1

2
‖P̃hw̃h‖2 ≤

1

2
‖w̃h‖2.

In particular, we have

h−s‖P̃hw̃h‖2 ≤ h−s‖w̃h‖2. (32)
Combining (31) and (32), we prove (30) by Corollary 4.2. �

The following lemma sets up the equivalence between ‖ · ‖W s? and ‖ · ‖V s? .

Lemma 4.5. Suppose that (H1)-(H2) are satisfied. There exist two positive constants C, c such that,
for each s ∈ (− 1

2
, 2),

c‖v?‖W s? ≤ ‖v?‖V s? for all v? ∈ V ?, (33)
and, for each s ∈ [−2, 2],

‖v?‖V s? ≤ C‖v?‖W s? for all v? ∈ V ?. (34)



CONVERGENCE TO SUITABLE WEAK SOLUTIONS FOR A SUBGRID FEM MODEL 11

Proof. Assertion (33) is proved as follows. Take v? ∈ V ? such that v? = vh + ṽh. Let s ∈ [0, 2].
Define (v, r) ∈ (V ∩H10(Ω))×H1∫ =0(Ω) such that{

−∆v +∇r = A?v? in Ω,
∇ · v = 0 in Ω.

By virtue of (H1), we have that ‖∆v‖ + ‖∇r‖ ≤ C‖A?v?‖. Moreover, we have that (vh, ṽh, rh) ∈
W h × W̃ h ×Qh satisfies, for all (wh, w̃h, qh) ∈W h × W̃ h ×Qh,

(∇vh,∇wh) + (∇rh,wh) = (A?v?,wh),
(vh,∇qh) + (ṽh,∇qh) = 0,

h−2(ṽh, w̃h) + (∇rh, w̃h) = (A?v?, w̃h).
Comparing both problems, we get the following error estimates, that can be found in [3, Lemma 3.2 ]:

‖∇(v − vh)‖+ h−1‖ṽh‖ ≤ Ch‖A?v?‖. (35)
Next, let us write

−(∆?v?,w?) = (∇(πW hv? − v),∇πW hw?) + h
−2(π⊥W hv?, π

⊥
W h
w?)− (∆v,wh),

where we have used the fact that −∆?v? = −∆hπW hv? − h
−2π⊥W hv?. Select w? = −∆?v? to find,

from (9) and (35), that

‖∆?v?‖2 = ‖∇(vh − v)‖‖∇πW h∆?v?‖+ h
−2‖π⊥W hv?‖‖π

⊥
W h

∆?v?‖+ ‖∆v‖‖∆?v?‖
≤ C‖A?v?‖‖∆?v?‖+ C‖A?v?‖‖∆?v?‖.

Thus, we obtain

‖∆?v?‖ ≤ C‖A?v?‖. (36)
Equivalently,

‖v?‖W 2? ≤ C‖v?‖V 2? .
We also have

‖v?‖W 0? ≤ C‖v?‖V 0? .
By interpolation, one then deduces

‖v?‖W s? ≤ C‖v?‖V s? . (37)
for all s ∈ [0, 2].

Let s ∈ (− 1
2
, 0]. Then

‖v?‖W s? = sup
w?∈W−s? \{0}

(v?,w?)

‖w?‖W−s?
= sup

w?∈W−s? \{0}

(v?, P?w?)

‖w?‖W−s?
.

In view of (30), we have

‖v?‖W s? ≤ C sup
w?∈W−s? \{0}

(v?, P?w?)

‖P?w?‖W−s?
≤ C sup

w?∈V −s? \{0}

(v?,w?)

‖w?‖V −s?

≤ C‖v?‖V s? sup
w?∈V −s? \{0}

‖w?‖V −s?
‖w?‖W−s?

≤ C‖v?‖V s? .

Assertion (34) is proved as follows. Pick v? ∈ V ?. Let s ∈ [0, 2]. It should be first noted that
A?R?w? = P?∆?w? for all w? ∈W ?. Then, it follows that

‖R?w?‖V 2? = ‖A?R?w?‖ = ‖P?∆?w?‖ ≤ ‖∆?w?‖ = ‖w?‖W 2? . (38)
Next, we have that

‖R?w?‖ ≤ C‖w?‖ (39)
holds for all w? ∈ W ?, i.e., ‖R?w?‖V 0? ≤ C‖wh‖W 0h for all w? ∈ W ?. Indeed, let R

T
? : V ? → W ?

the adjoint operator of R?, namely R
T
? = −∆?A−1? , since R? = −A−1? P?∆?. It is clear that if

‖RT? v?‖ ≤ C‖v?‖ (40)



12 S. BADIA AND J. V. GUTIÉRREZ-SANTACREU

holds for all v? ∈ V ?, then (39) is true. But (40) is a consequence of (36). By interpolation between
(38) and (39) for w? = v?, we obtain ‖v?‖V s? ≤ C‖v?‖W s? for all v? ∈ V ? and s ∈ [0, 2].

Let s ∈ [−2, 0]. From (37), we have

‖v?‖V s? = sup
v?∈V ?\{0}

(v?, v̄?)

‖v̄?‖V −s?
≤ C sup

v?∈V ?\{0}

(v?, v̄?)

‖v̄?‖W−s?
≤ ‖v?‖W s? .

It completes the proof. �

As a corollary to Lemma 4.5, we have the following inequality whose proof needs Corollary 4.2.

Corollary 4.6. Suppose that conditions (H1)-(H2) are satisfied. Then there exist two positive con-
stants C, c such that, for each s ∈ (− 1

2
, 3

2
),

c(‖vh‖H̃s0(Ω) + h
−s‖ṽh‖) ≤ ‖v?‖V s? for all v? ∈ V ?, (41)

and, for each s ∈ (− 3
2
, 3

2
),

‖v?‖V s? ≤ C(‖vh‖H̃s0(Ω) + h
−s‖ṽh‖) for all v? ∈ V ?. (42)

We are now concerned with the proof of an inf-sup condition in the framework of fractional Sobolev
spaces.

Lemma 4.7. Under conditions (H1)-(H3), it follows that, for s ∈ [0, 1],

sup
w?∈W ?\{0}

(∇qh,w?)
‖w?‖W 1−s?

& ‖qh‖Hs(Ω),

Proof. Let qh ∈ Qh. From (10) and (11), we have

sup

Moreover, we have, by (9),

‖πW h∇qh‖H̃1−s0 (Ω)

Combining the previous two estimates, we get

where C−11 = C

At this point, we have proved that

(∇qh, w̃h)

Finally, observe, by (22), that

Then it follows that

or equivalently, for any qh ∈ Qh, there exists an element w? ∈ W ? with norm ‖w?‖W 1−s? = 1, such
that (∇qh, v?) ≥ C‖qh‖Hs(Ω). It easily proves the lemma. �

5. A priori energy estimates

In this section we derive a series of a priori energy estimates resulting in that the sequence of the
approximate solutions (uh, ph) to scheme (17) approaches to a weak solution and a suitable weak
solution in Section 6.

Theorem 5.1. Under assumptions (H1), (H2), and (H4), there is a positive constant C, independent
of h, such that

‖uh‖L∞(0,T ;L2(Ω))∩L2(0,T ;H10(Ω)) + ‖ũh‖L∞(0,T ;L2(Ω))∩τ−1L2(0,T ;L2(Ω)) ≤ C. (43)

Proof. Take vh = uh in (17a), ṽh = ũh in (17c) and qh = ph in (17b) to get

(

Next we estimate the term (fh,uh). Thus, we have

(fh,uh) ≤ ‖f‖H−1(Ω)‖∇uh‖ ≤

2ν
‖f‖2H−1(Ω) +

‖∇uh‖2.

Therefore, we obtain

‖f‖2H−1(Ω),

which, integrated over (0, t), leads to the desired result. �

Remark 5.2. From (43), we have

‖uh‖Lr(0,T ;H2/r(Ω)) + ‖uh‖Lr(0,T ;Lk(Ω)) ≤ C, (44)

where 3

Consider u? = uh + ũh. Then problem (17) reads as follows. Find u? ∈ H1(0, T ;W ?) and
ph ∈ L2(0, T ;Qh) such that

(∂tu?,w?) + b?(u?,u?,w?)− ν(∆?u?,w?)− (∇ph,w?) = (fh, πW h(w?)), (45)
for all w? ∈W ?, with the initial condition u?(0) = u0h + ũ0h, where

formula

Lemma 5.3. Suppose that assumptions (H1)-(H3) hold. Let q be as in (H4), but q ∈ [1, 3

Proof. By definition of b(·, ·, ·), we have
b(πW hu?, πW hu?,w?) = 〈N (πW hu?, πW hu?),w?〉 ≤ ‖N (πW hu?, πW hu?)‖W−s? ‖w?‖W s? ,

which, combined with (22), gives

‖N (πW hu?, πW hu?)‖W−s? ≤ C‖N (πW hu?, πW hu?)‖H̃−s0 (Ω) + Ch

From the continuous embedding H̃

‖N (πW hu?, πW h(u?))‖W−s? ≤ C‖Nh(πW hu?, πW hu?)‖Lq(Ω) + h

Next, using (6), the definition of s, and the relation 1

6. Convergence towards weak and suitable weak solutions

In this section we will prove that the sequence of the approximate solutions provided by scheme (17)
converges towards a weak solution in the sense of Definition 2.3 and towards a suitable weak solution
in the sense of Definition 2.4. In order for these convergence results to hold, we will need to use the
following compactness results à la Aubin-Lions.

The following compactness result is due to Lions [32].

Lemma 6.1. Let H0 ↪→ H ↪→ H1 be three Hilbert spaces with dense and continuous embedding.
Assume that the embedding H0 ↪→ H is compact. Then L2(0, T ;H0) ∩Hγ(0, T ;H1) embeds compactly
in L2(0, T ;H) for γ > 0.

The proof of the two following compactness result can be found in [22, Ap. A.1, A.2].

Lemma 6.2. Let X ↪→ Y be two Hilbert spaces with compact embedding. Then Hβ(0, T ;X) embeds
continuously and compactly in C0([0, T ];Y ) for β > 1

2
.

Lemma 6.3. Let H0 ↪→ H1 be two Hilbert spaces with compact embedding. Let γ > 0 and γ > µ, then
the injection Hγ(0, T ;H0) ↪→ Hµ(0, TH1) is compact.

Theorem 6.4. Assume that hypotheses (H1)-(H4) are satisfied. Then there exists a subsequence
(denoted in the same way) of approximate solutions (uh, ph) converging toward a weak solution given
in Definition (2.3) in the following sense as h→ 0:

uh → u in L2(0, T ;H10(Ω))− weak and in L
2(0, T ;Hβ(Ω))− strong for all β < 1 (57)

] and r > 3

4
− s

2
, and q ∈ L2(0, T ;H1∫

=0
(Ω)). From

(11) and (12), we are allowed to construct three sequences {vh}h>0 ⊂ Hr(0, T ;W h), {ṽh}h>0 ⊂
Hr(0, T ; W̃ h) and {qh}h>0 ⊂ L2(0, T ;Qh) such that vh → v in Hr(0, T ; H̃

s

0(Ω))-strong, ṽh → 0 in
L2(0, T ;L2(Ω))-strong and qh → q in L2(0, T ;H1∫ =0(Ω))-strong as h→ 0.

By virtue of (43), (53), (54) and (55), we know that there exist a subsequence of {vh}h>0 and
{ph}h>0, still denoted by itself, and a pair (u, p) such that

uh → u in L∞(0, T ;L2(Ω))− weak-?,

uh → u in L2(0, T ;H10(Ω))− weak,

∂tuh → ∂tu in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω))− weak,

∆huh → ∆u in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω))− weak,

and

∇ph → ∇p in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω))− weak,

for all s ∈ ( 1
2
, 7

10
] and r > 3

2
. Observe that we have used that the fact that H̃

−s
(Ω) coincides with

H−s0 (Ω) for s ∈ (
1

] for the pressure. We also have, from (43), that

ũh → 0 in L2(0, T ;L2(Ω))− strong, (59)
since

‖ũh‖L2(0,T ;L2(Ω)) ≤ ‖τ

− 1
2 ũh‖L2(0,T ;L2(Ω)) ≤ C.

We can pass to the limit in (17b). Thus we find that ∇ · u = 0 in (0, T ) × Ω, whence u ∈
L∞(0, T ;H) ∩ L2(0, T ;V ). For the trilinear terms, we proceed as follows. By Lemma 6.1, we have
that

uh → u in L2(0, T ;Hβ(Ω))− strong for all β < 1,

since {uh}h>0 is bounded in L2(0, T ;H10(Ω))∩Hβ((0, T ); H̃
−α
0 (Ω)) for α ∈ [

1
4
, 1

2
) and 0 < β < 2

5
(1+α)

from (43) and (53). Therefore,

N (uh,uh)→ N (u,u) in D′((0, T )× Ω).
As a consequence of (46), we obtain

N (uh,uh)→ N (u,u) in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω)).

On passing to the limit in (17b), we have had that ∇ · u = 0 in (0, T )× Ω, thereby

N (uh,uh)→ (u · ∇)u in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω)).

By an analogous argument, we find that

Ñ (uh, ũh)→ 0 in H−r(0, T ; H̃
−s
0 (Ω)),

where 〈Ñ (uh, w̃h),vh〉 = b(uh,vh, w̃h) for all uh,wh ∈W h and ṽh ∈ W̃ h.
From the above convergences, it is easy to see that

∂tuh +N (uh,uh)− ν∆huh +∇ph − Ñ (uh, ũh)− fh → ∂tu+ (uh · ∇)uh − ν∆u+∇p− f .

in H−r(0, T ; H̃

For the initial condition, we have that uh → u in C0([0, T ]; H̃
−α
0 (Ω))-strong for α ∈ (

1
4
, 1

2
) by

Lemma 6.2; therefore, uh(0) → u(0) in H̃
−α
0 (Ω). Furthermore, it follows from (18) and (27) that

u0h → u0 in H̃
−α
0 (Ω). We have thus shown that u(0) = u0.

The energy inequality can be verified by the lower semicontinuity of the norm for the weak topology;
for complete details, see [4]. �

Theorem 6.5. Under hypotheses (H1)-(H4), the sequence of approximate solutions (uh, ph) converges,
up to a subsequence, to a suitable weak solution given in Definition 2.4 as h→ 0.

Proof. Let φ ∈ D((0, T )× Ω;R+) and substitute vh = πW h(uhφ) into (17a) to get∫ T
0

{(∂tuh, πW h(uhφ)) + b(uh,uh, πW h(uhφ)) + ν(∇uh,∇πW h(uhφ))

−(ph,∇ · πW h(uhφ))− b(uh, πW h(uhφ), ũh)− (fh, πW h(uhφ))} dt = 0.
(60)

We are ready to take the limit in (60) as h→ 0 so as to prove that the weak solution (u, p) found
in Theorem 6.4 is suitable. We will only focus on passing to the limit in the terms of (60) involving
the subscale velocity ũh and the pressure term. The remaining terms appear in a rudimentary finite
element formulation so that a proof can be found in [24]. In particular, from (13) and (9) and in virtue
of Lemma 6.3, it follows that

Appendix A. Proof of the inverse inequalities (8)

To prove inequalities (8), we follow very closely the arguments developed in [8, Thm. 4.5.11].
We first need to introduce an equivalent norm for fractional order Hilbert spaces as follows. Let

s ∈ (0, 1). Then
‖u‖2Hs(Ω) = ‖u‖

2 + |u|2Hs(Ω),
where

|u|2Hs(Ω) =
∫

Ω

∫
Ω

|u(x)− u(y)|2

|x− y|3+2s
dx dy.

Given (K,P,Σ), we define (K̃, P̃ , Σ̃) where K̂ = {(1/hK)x : x ∈ K}. Thus, if uh is a function
defined on K, then ûh is defined on K̃ by

û(x̂) = u(h−1K x) for all x̂ ∈ K̂.
Thus we can write

‖∇uh‖L2(K) = h
1
2

K‖∇̂ûh‖L2(K).
As ∇̂ûh belongs to a space of finite and fixed dimension on K̂, on which all norms are equivalent, it is
not hard to see that there is a constant C

T̂
> 0 such that

‖∇̂ûh‖L2(K) ≤ CT̂ |ûh|Hs(K̂).

Reverting to K, this leads to

‖∇̂û‖L2 ≤ CT̂h
− 3

2
+s

K |uh|Hs(K)
and hence

‖∇uh‖L2(K) ≤ CT̂h
−1+s
K ‖uh‖Hs(Ω).

An argument in the proof of [8, Prop. 4.4.11 ] shows that if (K̃, P̃, Σ̃) is a referent element, we have
that there exists a constant CT̃ > 0 such that CT̂ ≤ CT̃ . Summing over all elements K and using the
quasi-uniformity of the mesh leads to

‖∇uh‖ ≤ Ch−1+s
( ∑
K∈Th

‖uh‖2Hs(Ω)

)
.

Then (8) follows because the sum of the fractional norms over all elements is smaller than the fractional
norm over the union of the elements.
