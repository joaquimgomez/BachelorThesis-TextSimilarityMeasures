Abstract: This work studies the metallurgical and microstructural aspects of Friction Stir Welding
(FSW) in terms of grain size and microhardness. The modelling is based on the combination of
an apropos kinematic framework for the local simulation of FSW processes and a material particle
tracing technique for tracking the material flow during the weld. The resulting grain size and
microhardness values are validated with experimental observations from an identical processed
sample. A Sheppard-Wright constitutive relation is adopted to describe the mechanical behavior of
AZ31 Mg alloy considered in this work. The strain rate and temperature histories obtained from the
numerical model are stored on the tracers. The relationship among the grain size, microhardness,
strain rate, and temperature is obtained using Zener-Hollomon parameter and Hall-Petch relationship.
A linear description relates the logarithm of average grain size to the logarithm of Zener-Hollomon
parameter. The relationship between microhardness and average grain size stands away from the
linear trend.

1. Introduction

In the FSW process, a fast-rotating tool moves along the joining line, mixing the deformed material
and altering the microstructure of the unprocessed parts. The impact of the tool rotation rate is on
the material flow through wavering the frictional heat input and volume of material conveyed and
released, having a great effect on the creation and shape of the stir zone [1].

Friction Stir Welding (FSW), being a solid state joining technology, refines the grain size due
to recrystallization arising from both frictional heating and plastic dissipation during the welding.
The fine-grained microstructures results in exquisite mechanical properties in the weld. Grain refinement
in metallic materials drastically increases yield strength while improving the toughness.

Based on the microstructural characterization of grains and precipitates, various zones are
identified in the FSW joint (Figure 1): Base Metal (BM), Nugget Zone (NZ), Thermo-Mechanically
Affected Zone (TMAZ), and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). NZ is where the grain size is significantly
refined due to the dynamic recrystallization caused by intense plastic deformation and frictional
heating during FSW. The TMAZ, lying between NZ and HAZ, is the zone where the material is
plastically deformed and heated, but, insufficient to cause recrystallization. The HAZ encounters just a
heating effect, with no mechanical deformation. The grain structures are like that of the base material,
yet some recently shaped grains surrounding the large grains originated from static recrystallization
exist. The post weld mechanical properties are altogether influenced by the microstructural changes of
the mentioned zones. Figure 1 shows the macrostructure of the FSW joint, where AS and RS denote
the advancing and retreating sides, respectively.

Grain evolution in these welding zones is one of the key elements for controlling the welding 
quality and for understanding the FSW mechanism.  

Several studies have been devoted to investigating material flow visualization and 
corresponding microstructural alteration during FSW.  

In the work of Pashazadeh et al. [3], a numerical model is developed for the prediction of 
temperature profile, effective plastic strain, and material flow in FSW of copper plates. The material 
flow pattern utilizing point tracking is in great concurrence with the examinations.  

In the work of Padmanaban et al. [4], the temperature profile and material flow during FSW of 
dissimilar alloys (AA2024 and AA7075) using a cylindrical tool are predicted by a steady-state, visco-
plastic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. They demonstrated that increasing the tool 
rotation speed and the shoulder diameter increases the material flow, while increasing the welding 
speed decreases the material flow in the stir zone. 

In Dialami et al. [5,6], the material flow in FSW process is modelled using a material tracing 
method. The tracer trajectories are computed using the Backward Euler with Sub-stepping (BES), the 
4-th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) and the Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction (BFECC). 
The material flow pattern is compared with the experimental evidence. 

In the work of Masaki et al. [7], the recrystallized grains of the stir zone of 1050 Al after FSW 
process is simulated. They take into account both the creation of recrystallized grains during the 
deformation procedure and the grain growth during the following cooling phase. It is performed via 
a sequence of the plane-strain compression test at different strain rates and the resulting cooling 
following the cooling cycle of FSW.  

Zhang et al. [8] used an adaptive re-meshing finite element model to predict the temperature 
and material behavior during FSW of AA6082-T6. The Monte Carlo (MC) strategy with nucleation in 
each MC step is utilized for the analysis of the grain development in FSW. They investigated that an 
increase in the tool rotational speed or the tool shoulder diameter increases the overall grain size and 
the width of the welding zones. 

In the work of Chang et al. [9], the relationship between the grain size, strain rate and 
temperature in FSW processing on AZ31 Mg alloy is analyzed. The grain orientation distribution is 
additionally considered utilizing the X-ray diffraction. 

In the work of Pan et al. [10], a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for FSW is 
adopted. The temperature history and distribution, grain size, microhardness and additionally the 
texture evolution are displayed. 

In the work of Darras et al. [11], friction stir processing is used to refine the microstructure and 
features of AZ31B-H24 magnesium alloy. The impact of a few process parameters on thermal 
histories, final microstructure and properties are examined.  

An experimentally established finite element model is considered in the work of Ammouri et al. 
[12] to appraise the strain rate and the temperature values for calculating the Zener-Hollomon 
parameter of twin-roll-cast (TRC) AZ31B after friction stir processing. 

Fratini et al. [13] link an artificial neural network to a finite element model to predict the average 
grain size values in the FSW process starting from experimental data and numerical results as input.

Fratini et al. [13] link an artificial neural network to a finite element model to predict the average
grain size values in the FSW process starting from experimental data and numerical results as input.

Saluja et al. [14] present a cellular automata-coupled finite element (CAFE) model to estimate the
grain size profile during FSW. The simulation is performed applying thermal and strain rate analytical
models on the FSW elements using ABAQUS6.8.

Although a vast number of studies on microstructure of the material are available, a robust
numerical model able to predict the microstructure evolution in the material after FSW process is still
lacking. The relationship between the trajectory, the temperature and strain rate evolution and the
final position of the flowing material tracers and the grain growth has not been investigated in depth.
Also, recrystallization during FSW takes place in the presence of rapid transients and severe gradients
in strain rate and temperature, which further complicates the microstructural characterization.

In this work, we strive to upgrade the FSW model formerly established by the authors [15–20]
with a microstructural model able to predict the average grain size and microhardness. This model
is not only fast and accurate and enriched with the enhanced friction model but also incorporates a
material tracing technique to track the position of each material tracer during the weld from the initial
position until the final location. The material tracing technique allows the prediction of the final grain
size by incorporating the thermo-mechanical histories extracted from the finite element model.

In the present work, the microstructural characterization for the AZ31 Mg alloy is that proposed
in reference [9] during friction stir processing (it has been also used in e.g., [7,10,12,21]). FSW processed
magnesium alloys are found to have noticeable grain refinement [22]. Moreover, joining magnesium
alloys using solid-state processes such as FSW has many advantages over conventional welding
technologies [23,24]. Among others, it avoids defects such as hot cracking and partial melting zone.

The numerical simulation performed here is compared against the experimental data presented
in the work of Darras et al. [11]. The proposed model defines a significant forward step towards
accounting for microstructural effects within the overall thermomechanical FSW model that has
proven to be a robust approach to now.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents briefly the solution strategy incorporated
in this work to obtain the thermomechanical results and to find the material tracer position.
Then, the microstructural evolution in terms of grain growth and microhardness for AZ31 Mg alloy is
introduced. At the end, a 3D numerical example is presented with the aim to compare the calculated
grain size and microhardness with the experimental data of reference [11].

2. Solution Strategy

The two-stage strategy for the simulation of FSW processes lately developed by the authors [18]
is used in this work. The strategy includes two thermo-mechanical simulation phases: the speed-up
stage and the periodic stage.

The speed-up stage aims at reaching the steady-state close to the final periodic state. This is
accomplished by accelerating the inertial term in the energy balance equation using a speed-up factor
to decrease the thermal capacity. In this stage, the pin tool is kept in a fixed configuration within the
considered Eulerian framework. Thus, no periodic solution due to the pin rotation is obtained.

The periodic stage starts from the thermo-mechanical results (temperature and velocity fields)
acquired from the first stage as initial conditions. The FSW analysis using non-cylindrical pin-shapes
leads to a periodic solution according to the real rotation of the pin. Further details on the strategy can
be consulted in reference [18].

In both stages, the mechanical problem is quasi-static due to the low values of Reynolds number
in the FSW process. Contrariwise, a transient thermal problem is solved in both stages to accurately
evaluate the flow characteristics during the rotation of the asymmetrical tool.

Figure 2 illustrates the summarized features of both simulation phases.

Figure 2. Two-stage strategy concept. 

2.1. Kinematic Framework 

This work focuses on the periodic stage of the simulation where the material flow due to the 
rotating and advancing movement of the tool are accounted for. It is also feasible to determine the 
thermo-mechanical history that the material experiences. In this stage, an apropos kinematic 
framework is adopted using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE), Eulerian and Lagrangian 
schemes. 

The use of an apropos kinematic framework in a FSW problem conveniently allows dealing with 
arbitrary pin profiles and applying the boundary conditions. A domain including the tool and the 
Thermo-Mechanically Affected Zone (TMAZ) is considered. The Lagrangian formulation is used for 
the rigidly rotating tool. ALE and Eulerian formulations are used for the TMAZ and the remaining 
part of the analyzed domain, respectively (see Figure 2). Details on the apropos kinematic framework 
are given in reference [15].  

2.2. Material Tracing  

In the ALE and Eulerian frameworks, the mesh representing the workpiece does not follow the 
material movement. Therefore, to find the final locations of the flowing material points and their 
microstructure evolution, a material tracing technique needs to be executed.  

The grain sizes in the last locations of the followed material points can be then processed from 
the temperature and strain rate histories extracted from the finite element model. 

The heat generated during the FSW process augments the temperature at the workpiece starting 
at the contact surface with the tool and reduces the material flow stress. Consequently, plastic flow 
of the material increases resulting in generation of very large plastic deformation and friction at tool-
workpiece contact interface. Thus, the temperature rises, and its distribution causes the 
microstructure evolution in the welding zone. The modified grain size and grain boundary character 
affect the mechanical properties of the weld. Therefore, to predict correctly the microstructure 
evolution, it becomes necessary to obtain information regarding temperature distribution and flow 
behavior during FSW as the variation in the grain sizes of the welding zone are characterized by the 
deformation and the temperature histories in the FSW procedure. In the light of the material flow 
rule of each followed tracer, the histories of the strain rates and the temperatures can be ascertained 
and additionally utilized for prediction of the grain size evolutions in the welding area. Moreover,

2.2. Material Tracing

In the ALE and Eulerian frameworks, the mesh representing the workpiece does not follow the
material movement. Therefore, to find the final locations of the flowing material points and their
microstructure evolution, a material tracing technique needs to be executed.

The grain sizes in the last locations of the followed material points can be then processed from the
temperature and strain rate histories extracted from the finite element model.

The heat generated during the FSW process augments the temperature at the workpiece starting
at the contact surface with the tool and reduces the material flow stress. Consequently, plastic
flow of the material increases resulting in generation of very large plastic deformation and friction
at tool-workpiece contact interface. Thus, the temperature rises, and its distribution causes the
microstructure evolution in the welding zone. The modified grain size and grain boundary character
affect the mechanical properties of the weld. Therefore, to predict correctly the microstructure evolution,
it becomes necessary to obtain information regarding temperature distribution and flow behavior
during FSW as the variation in the grain sizes of the welding zone are characterized by the deformation
and the temperature histories in the FSW procedure. In the light of the material flow rule of each
followed tracer, the histories of the strain rates and the temperatures can be ascertained and additionally
utilized for prediction of the grain size evolutions in the welding area. Moreover, knowing the material

tracer motion assists to determine the location of various welding zones on the cross section of the
friction stir weld.

To perform material tracing, a set of tracers is initially distributed in the domain representing
the material.

Figure 3 shows the domain used to perform a FSW simulation with material tracing. Note that
material tracers are not grains themselves.

Then the tracing technique permits following the motion of each material tracer and find its
position at each time step of the simulation during the weld.

The position of a tracer at time, X(t), is obtained by solving the following equation at each
time-step of the simulation:

X(t) = X0 +
∫ t

0
V(X(t), t)dt (1)

where X0 is the initial position of each tracer and V(X(t), t) is the velocity at its present position
(Figure 4).

Having computed the velocity of the material tracers, their position is found by performing the
appropriate time integration. The 4-th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) time integration scheme is the one
used in this work. This method is chosen due to its capability of the exact integration of a circular
trajectory (typical profile path in FSW).

A search algorithm is executed to find the finite element where each tracer is located at each time
step. The velocity and temperature of the material tracers are interpolated from the nodal velocities
and temperature of the finite element, respectively. The strain rate (

2.3. Heat Generation

Plastic dissipation and friction are the origins of heat generation calculated at the mechanical
partition of the problem and coupled to the thermal partition.

The viscoplastic dissipation (Dmech) reads:

Dmech = βs :
.
ε, (2)

where β is the fraction of plastic dissipation converted into heat and s is the stress deviator.
Friction phenomena are modelled by an enhanced friction model proposed by the authors in [19].

This model considers the impact of non-uniform pressure distribution regularly seen under the FSW
tool which brings about higher friction before the tool and lower friction at the back. This non-
uniformity leads to the generation of the significant transversal force recorded in the experimental
measurements which cannot be modeled using common friction laws such as Coulomb or Norton [19].
The enhanced friction law reads:

τT = a(x, T)‖∆vT‖
qn, (3)

where τT is the friction shear stress, q is the sensitivity parameter (0 ≤ q ≤ 1) and ∆vT is the respective
slip velocity among the contact surfaces of the tool and the workpiece. n = ∆vT‖∆vT‖

is the slip direction.
The consistency parameter a(x, T) at the tool/workpiece interface is non-uniformly expressed as:

a(x) = 0.5
(

amax + amin + (amax − amin) tanh
x

R/6

)
, (4)

being x the position relative to the rotation axis at the tool/workpiece interface and projected along the
welding direction and R the shoulder radius. Friction tractions exhibit variations between maximum
to minimum value from the heading side of the shoulder to the backside. Since the temperature of the
working zone does not change considerably, it is assumed that the maximum (amax) and minimum
(amin) consistency parameters depend on the average working temperature only.

2.4. Flow Stress

To model the flow stress of the magnesium workpiece a Sheppard-Wright constitutive relation is
adopted (Sheppard et al. [25]). According to this model, the effective viscosity µe f f is characterized as

a function of effective flow stress σe (i.e., norm of deviatoric stress) and effective strain rate

of deviatoric strain rate) as

where the material constants α, A and n are computed by fitting the experimental response of the

3. Microstructure Evolution, Grain Size and Microhardness

The modeling of the metallurgical and microstructural aspects of FSW is described in this section.
Material mixing and heat generation in FSW procedures lead to considerable microstructure and
material properties alterations. The continuous dynamic recrystallization phenomena contribute to
grain refinement in the weld and strongly influence the final joint strength.

To predict the average grain size and microhardness, the Zener-Hollomon parameter and the
Hall-Petch relationship are used.

The temperature and strain rate values are computed from the finite element analysis model
at each time step of the second (periodic) stage and are used in the calculation of Zener-Hollomon
parameter for each tracer of the moving material placed in the finite element model. The methodology
used in this work considers the effect of the steep gradients of strain rates and temperature that occur
in the stir zone. In fact, they are fully considered in the local analysis of the FSW process and they are
significant. To this end, an apropos kinematic framework is used, with the stir zone appropriately
modeled using an ALE/Eulerian formulation. To obtain the strain rate and temperature history of
the material tracers, these tracers are followed during the weld as they pass through the critical zone
where the most significant changes of strain rate and temperature occur. These variations are recorded
in the tracer history and the computation of the Zener-Hollomon parameter.

The Zener-Hollomon parameter is identified with the subsequent grain size because of dynamic
recrystallization in extruded magnesium-based alloys (Wang et al. [21]). In the reference [9], dynamic
recrystallization is given as the cause of the fine grains in friction stir processed Al and Mg alloys
samples. The relationship between the Zener-Hollomon parameter and the recrystallized grain size for
AZ31 Mg alloy is proposed by Chang et al. [9]. A linear relationship between the average grain size
values vs. Zener-Hollomon parameter trends in logarithmic scale according to Chang et al. [9] yields

ln(d) = 9.0− 0.27 ln(Z), (8)

where d is the average grain size in µm. The coefficients are slightly different from those obtained
earlier by Wang et al. [21] and Huang et al. [27]. They confirmed from the experimental data on the
grain size and Zener–Hollomon parameter that the resulting grain sizes basically follow similar trends
irrespective of the deformation path.

This relationship is used also in the other works [10]. A similar log-linear relationship is also
presented in references [12,21]. For 6063 Al alloys, Sato et al. [7] define a similar relationship between
grain size and temperature.

Figure 5 shows the logarithmic relationship between grain size and the Zener-Hollomon
parameter, Equation (8), used in this work.Metals 2018, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW  8 of 16 

 

 
Figure 5. Logarithmic relationship between grain size and the Zener-Hollomon parameter. 

Through this relationship, the grain size is correlated with the local temperature compensated 
strain rate and, in turn, with the local material velocities. The average grain size increments by 
expanding the working temperature and diminishing the strain rate.  

The above-mentioned equation is valid for a working zone characterized by equivalent strain 
rate and temperature higher than 0.5 s−1 and 227 °C, respectively. The temperature range of 
magnesium alloys recrystallization is 250–480 °C (Fatemi-Varzaneh et al. [28]). 

Microhardness is inhomogeneously dispersed in FSW welds. This distribution is identified with 
the grain size, crystallographic texture, dislocation density, and distribution of hardening phases. 
According to the Hall-Petch relationship, the Vickers microhardness, Hv, in the processing zone is 
obtained (Chang et al. [9]) as  

5.0
v 7240

−+= dH , (9) 

Therefore, reducing the grain size increases the microhardness in FSW welds.  
Figure 6 shows the non-linear relationship between grain size and the microhardness.  

 
Figure 6. Hall-Petch relationship for grain size and microhardness. 

Finally, it should be noted that recrystallization during FSW takes place in the presence of rapid 
transients and severe gradients in strain rate and temperature. The numerical model for FSW here 
contemplated can record the full history of the strain rate and the temperature for each tracer, as it 
travels across the working zone. However, the microstructural characterization described in this 
Section, from reference [9], takes into account the peak values of the state thermo-mechanical 
variables, but not their rates of change. Introducing such a refinement in the microstructural model

Through this relationship, the grain size is correlated with the local temperature compensated
strain rate and, in turn, with the local material velocities. The average grain size increments by
expanding the working temperature and diminishing the strain rate.

The above-mentioned equation is valid for a working zone characterized by equivalent strain rate
and temperature higher than 0.5 s−1 and 227 ◦C, respectively. The temperature range of magnesium
alloys recrystallization is 250–480 ◦C (Fatemi-Varzaneh et al. [28]).

Microhardness is inhomogeneously dispersed in FSW welds. This distribution is identified with
the grain size, crystallographic texture, dislocation density, and distribution of hardening phases.
According to the Hall-Petch relationship, the Vickers microhardness, Hv, in the processing zone is
obtained (Chang et al. [9]) as

Hv = 40 + 72d

Therefore, reducing the grain size increases the microhardness in FSW welds.

4. Model Validation

The aim of this section is to validate the numerical model proposed here for the prediction of
the microstructural behavior by comparing the computed results with experimental data provided
in the literature. It compares the numerical results in terms of temperature, average grain size and
microhardness with the experimental data of reference [11]. The geometrical data and the selected
material are chosen according to the experimental set-up presented in the work of Darras et al. [11].

The cylindrical tool consists of a pin with 6.35 mm diameter, 3.048 mm height, and a 12.7 mm
diameter shoulder. A workpiece domain of 100 × 50 × 3.175 mm3 is considered. Rotational and
advancing velocities are 1200 rpm and 0.0093 m/s, respectively. Boundary conditions are defined by
prescribing the advancing velocity of the workpiece, opposite to the weld direction (relative movement)
and rotating speed is applied to the tool.

The workpiece material is AZ31 Mg alloy. Its mechanical properties corresponding to the
Sheppard-Wright constitutive model are α = 1.9 (Mpa)−1, A = 7.78 × 108 s−1, n = 4.36 and
Q = 129 × 103 J/mol (Tello et al. [26]). Its thermal properties are density = 1777 kg/m3, thermal
conductivity = 400 W/m K and specific heat = 1164 J/kg K (Hu et al. [29]).

It is considered that 90% of the plastic dissipation is transferred into heat. The analysis adopts
the minimum and maximum friction coefficients equal to amin = 2.35 × 107 and amax = 4.7 × 108 at
tool/workpiece interfaces, respectively.

The workpiece is discretized by 360,000 tetrahedral elements and 70,000 nodes, approximately.
200,000 material tracers are distributed in the domain of 30 × 13.5 × 3.175 mm3 covering the entire
thickness of the workpiece and the working zone.

This work considers a set of tracers representing the material in a part of the domain. These material
tracers move following the material flow. At each time step their position is found and the temperature
and strain rate are recorded on the tracer. From these data the grain size is calculated for each tracer.
Recall that material tracers are not grains themselves.

At the first stage, the temperature distribution obtained from the thermo-mechanical numerical
model at the steady state using an Eulerian formulation is compared with the temperature variation

Figures 12 and 13 illustrate the distribution of the mentioned parameters in a vertical cross

than at the retreating side because of the distinctive material flow designs. The maximum

Figure 15a presents the working and non-working zones according to the limits defined by

The processed material is portrayed by non-uniform grain sizes differing from 1 to 10 µm with an
average grain size of 4.9 µm. The average grain size obtained from the numerical model is in accordance
with the experimental value of 4.2 µm presented in Darras et al. [11]. It is found that the resultant
grain size is a combination of grain refinement, because of the expanding strain rate, and grain growth,
because of the temperature rise. This behavior is confirmed also by Rodriguez et al. [30]. At constant
temperature, the grain size decreases for increasing strain rate. Conversely, at constant strain rate,
the grain size increments as the temperature increases. Therefore, the greatest grain refinement occurs
at lower temperature and higher strain rates.

Figure 16 (reproduced from ref. [11]) presents the histogram of grain intercept obtained from a
micrograph of size 70 × 80 µm2, a small fraction of the overall domain (approx. 100 × 50 mm2 in
size). Figure 17 shows the grain size distribution after FSW on the set of material tracers located within
the working zone. It presents the grain size (X axis) versus the number of material tracers (Y axis).
It shows how many of the material tracers used in the numerical modeling fall into a certain range of
grain size. These two histograms of grain size are not directly comparable. The reasons for this are:

(1) The numerical distribution of grain size is obtained for the whole working zone, while the
experimental micrograph is just one sample.

(2) Tracers are not grains, they are material sampling points used for evaluating the gran size (they
have not information of grain shape).

However, the average grain size of the micrograph analysis (4.2 µm) is statistically representative
of the experimental result. This compares remarkably well with the numerical prediction of 4.9 µm.

As reported in the work of Darras et al. [11], the grain structure after the welding process is more

the left-hand side providing greater refinement and a homogenous equiaxed microstructure. The finer

thickness of the working zone. The distribution of the hardness varies between 60 and 80. The average
calculated hardness is 73 while in the work of Darras et al. [11] the experimental hardness is around 70.
As the temperature increases more softening of the material due to grain growth occurs. As indicated
by the Hall-Petch relationship, the hardness is contrarily proportional to the grain growth. Therefore,
the hardness decreases.

5. Conclusions 

In this work, the computational prediction of metallurgical and microstructural aspects of the 
FSW processed material in terms of grain size and microhardness are discussed. Results are validated 
with experimental data from reference [11]. 

A two-stage procedure for decreasing the computational time is adopted. The local simulation 
of the FSW process is performed using an apropos kinematic framework to obtain equivalent strain 
rate and temperature values at finite element nodes. A material particle tracing technique is applied 
at the second stage for tracking the material flow during the weld. The relationship among the 
resulting grain size, microhardness, and the applied working strain rate and temperature for the 
friction stir processing in the AZ31 Mg alloy is examined.  

A log-linear description relates the average grain size to the Zener-Hollomon parameter. In turn, 
the Zener-Hollomon parameter relies upon the history of strain rate and temperature of the moving 
tracers located in the finite element model.  

Compared to the experimental data, good agreement with the computational results is observed 
in terms of temperature, average grain size and microhardness. The results show evidence of grain 
refinement and homogenization of the microstructure. The resultant grain size is a consequence of 
the opposed effects of grain refinement, by increasing strain rate, and grain growth, by the 
temperature rise. As the temperature increases, the material softens due to grain growth and thus, 
the hardness decreases.

5. Conclusions 

In this work, the computational prediction of metallurgical and microstructural aspects of the 
FSW processed material in terms of grain size and microhardness are discussed. Results are validated 
with experimental data from reference [11]. 

A two-stage procedure for decreasing the computational time is adopted. The local simulation 
of the FSW process is performed using an apropos kinematic framework to obtain equivalent strain 
rate and temperature values at finite element nodes. A material particle tracing technique is applied 
at the second stage for tracking the material flow during the weld. The relationship among the 
resulting grain size, microhardness, and the applied working strain rate and temperature for the 
friction stir processing in the AZ31 Mg alloy is examined.  

A log-linear description relates the average grain size to the Zener-Hollomon parameter. In turn, 
the Zener-Hollomon parameter relies upon the history of strain rate and temperature of the moving 
tracers located in the finite element model.
