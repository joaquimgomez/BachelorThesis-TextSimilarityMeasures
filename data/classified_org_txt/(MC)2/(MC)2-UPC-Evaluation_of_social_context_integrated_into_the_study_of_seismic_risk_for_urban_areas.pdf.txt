Abstract 

Usually the seismic risk evaluation involves only the estimation of the expected physical damage, casualties or 

economic losses. This article corresponds to a holistic approach for seismic risk assessment which involves the 

evaluation of the social fragility and the lack of resilience. The complementary evaluation of social context aspects 

such as the distribution of the population, the absence of economic and social development, deficiencies in 

institutional management, and lack of capacity for response and recovery; is useful in order to have seismic risk 

evaluation suitable to support a decision making processes for risk reduction. 

The proposed methodology allows a standardized assessment of the social fragility and lack of resilience, by 

means of an aggravating coefficient of which summarizes the characteristics of the social context using fuzzy sets 

and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The selection of 20 social indicators is based on the indicators used by 

urban observatories of United Nations and other social researchers. These indicators are classified according to 

social item they describe, in six categories. Applying the determination level analysis, thirteen prevailing social 

indicators are selected. The proposed methodology has been applied in the cities of Merida (Venezuela) and 

Barcelona (Spain).  

Keywords: Urban seismic risk, social vulnerability, social fragility, lack of resilience, social indicators, 

holistic assessment of seismic risk.

1 Introduction 

Several methodologies to evaluate risk due to natural hazards have been developed around the world. Usually, 

these methodologies provide an estimation of the potential physical damage in an urban area exposed to a 

specific natural hazard. In general, the physical damage is evaluated as damage both on buildings and lifelines, 

and different types of victims (people killed, injured, homeless and jobless). 

Among the methodologies focused on seismic risk, some can be mentioned: the methodologies developed in 

EEUU, the ATC-13 [1], RADIUS [2] and HAZUS [3]; in Europe RISK-UE [4], LESSLOSS [5], SYNER-G 

[6], UPStrat-MAFA  [7], the international initiative GEM [8] and the platform for probabilistic evaluation of 

risk CAPRA [9, 10]. 

The study of the seismic vulnerability of urban areas has been focused on the physical dimension without 

mention of the social dimension. However, this approach is changing; the relevant authorities are recognizing 

the importance of social aspects, such as, rapid population growth, access to good quality education and 

health, application and development of construction standards and level of governance, among others [11]. 

Globally there are different criteria and definitions to quantify the social context [12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. 

The seismic risk in urban areas is usually assessed in terms of physical losses that can occur. However, the 

risk can be evaluated from a comprehensive (or holistic) approach taking into account aspects of the social 

context like: economic and social development absence, deficiencies of institutional management, and lack of 

capacity for response and recover from a dangerous event. 

The first international United Nations (UN) conference to fully recognize the challenge of urbanization was 

held in 1976 in Vancouver, Canada (Habitat I). This conference resulted in the creation of the precursors of 

UN-Habitat: the United Nations Commission on Human Settlements – an intergovernmental body – and the 

United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (commonly referred to as “Habitat”), which served as the 

executive secretariat of the Commission. 

Twenty years later, 1996, the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) was held 

in Istanbul, Turkey. The aim was to address two main twin goals, namely 1) to ensure adequate shelter for all 

and 2) to guarantee sound development of human settlements in an urbanizing world. This conference was 

organized to assess two decades of progress since Habitat I and to set fresh goals for the new millennium. As 

result, the Habitat agenda was proclaimed containing over 100 commitments and 600 recommendations. Other 



3 
 

global conferences were held between the conferences Habitat I and II, on which Habitat II reaffirmed its 

results.  

The Millennium Declaration was adopted by the 189 members of the United Nations, on September 8
th

 of 

2000. It was based on global conferences held during the 1990s. The countries committed to the right to 

development, peace and security, gender equality, poverty eradication and sustainable human development. 

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 consisting in 8 goals to be achieved, with 18 targets 

and a set of 48 technical indicators to measure their progress were established following the adoption of the 

Millennium Declaration. In 2007, the monitoring framework was updated to 21 targets and 60 indicators [19]. 

On the other hand, the Disaster Risk Management Index (DRMi or RMI) is widely used to evaluate the risk 

management performance of a country or a city. The DRMi brings together a group of indicators related to the 

risk management performance of the country. These reflect the organizational, development, capacity and 

institutional action taken to reduce vulnerability and losses, to prepare for crisis, and to efficiently recover  

[20, 21, 22]. This index is evaluated by using the qualitative measurement based on pre-established desirable 

referents (benchmarking) towards which risk management should be directed, according to its level of 

advance. For RMI formulation, four components or public policies are considered: Risk identification (RI), 

Risk reduction (RR), Disaster management (DM) and Governance and financial protection (FP). According to 

Carreño et al. [21, 22] the evaluation of each public policy takes into account 6 subindicators that characterize 

the performance of management in the country. Assessment of each subindicator is made using five 

performance levels: low, incipient, significant, outstanding and optimal, that corresponds to a range from 1 to 

5, where 1 is the lowest level and 5 the highest. 

As result of several World Conferences promoted by United Nations and others urban observatories, social 

indicators have been established to reflect different social aspects for any urban area around the world. These 

indicators are figures that allow describing complex and intangible aspects of the society.  

Cardona [17] developed a conceptual framework and a model for risk analysis of a city from a holistic 

perspective, describing seismic risk by means of indices. He considered both “hard” and “soft” risk variables 

of the urban centre, taking into account exposure, socio-economic characteristics of the different areas or 

neighborhoods of the city and their disaster coping capacity or degree of resilience. One of the objectives of 

this model is to guide the decision-making in risk management, helping to identify the critical zones of the city 



4 
 

and their vulnerability from the perspective of different professional disciplines. This method base the 

evaluation in a relative normalization of the involved indicators. 

Carreño [23] developed an alternative method for Urban Risk Evaluation, starting from Cardona’s model [17], 

in which urban risk is evaluated using composite indicators or indices. Expected building damage and losses 

in the infrastructure, obtained from loss scenarios, are basic information for the evaluation of a physical risk 

index in each unit of analysis [24]. Often, when historical information is available, the seismic hazard can be 

identified and thus the most potential critical situation for the urban center. It conserves the approach based on 

indicators, but it improves the procedure of normalization and calculates the final risk indices in an absolute 

(non-relative) manner. This feature facilitates the comparison of risk among urban centers. The exposure and 

the seismic hazard were eliminated in the evaluation method because they are included into the calculation of 

the physical risk variables. The Carreño’s approach [24, 25] preserves the use of indicators and fuzzy sets or 

membership functions, proposed originally by Cardona [17], but in a different way. Afterwards, the robustness 

of the methodology was evaluated [26]. The methodology has been also applied to other cities as Metro-

Manila, The Philippines, and Istanbul, Turkey [27, 28].  

The holistic evaluation of risk using indices is achieved aggravating the physical risk by means of the 

contextual conditions, such as the socio-economic fragility and the lack of resilience. Input data about these 

conditions at urban level are necessary to apply the method. The socio-economic fragility and the lack of 

resilience are described by a set of indicators (related to indirect or intangible effects) that aggravate the 

physical risk (potential direct effects). Thus, the total risk depends on the direct effect, or physical risk, and the 

indirect effects expressed as a factor of the direct effects. Therefore, the total risk is expressed as follows: 

 FRR
FT

 1
 (1) 

where RT is the total risk index, RF is the physical risk index and F is the aggravating coefficient. This 

coefficient, F, depends on the weighted sum of a set of aggravating factors related to the socio-economic 

fragility, FFSi, and the lack of resilience of the exposed context, FFRj, respectively. The descriptors used in this 

evaluation have different nature and units, the transformation functions standardize the gross values of the 

descriptors, transforming them into commensurable factors with values between 0 and 1. 



5 
 

An alternative method base on the fuzzy sets theory was proposed to be used in cases where information on 

physical risk, social fragility or lack and resilience are not available, but local expert opinion can be obtained 

[29, 30]. 

This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the aggravating coefficient by using standard indicators, easy 

to collect, measuring social aspects which can make the situation worse in the case that a seismic event occurs. 

This paper defines a minimum and maximum number of indicators which can represent the social aspects that 

should be taken into account for a seismic risk evaluation. 

2 Social context evaluation  

This section proposes an indicator selection process in order to define the social indicators to be involved into 

the aggravating coefficient (F) for the holistic evaluation for the seismic risk. This selection is based on the 

indicators adopted and recognized at global level.  

Based on several social indicators recognized at global level and the comprehensive or holistic approach for 

the seismic risk assessment, the following sub-sections show the selection process of social indicators that 

contribute to the aggravating coefficient, F, the determination of an optimum number of indicators (n), the 

calculation to establish the factors associated to each social indicator (Fsocial indicator i) and their participation 

weights (wi) involved in equation 2.

2.1 Selection process for social indicators 

The evaluation of the social context is a very complex task for almost all knowledge areas since the society is 

a very flexible system with a high degree of uncertainty. In order to evaluate de social vulnerability for urban 

areas several indicators have been proposed [14, 15, 23, 31 and 32]. 

The authors have selected twenty indicators among those used at global level to describe the social context for 

an urban area. These indicators correspond to indicators used by: Habitat Agenda [33], Istanbul+5 [34], the 

Millennium Gevelopment Goals [35] and the Carreño’s methodology [23, 24]. The selected indicators are 



6 
 

classified into 6 categories: i) Dwelling (C1), ii) Social development and poverty eradication (C2), iii) Urban 

Planning (C3), iv) Governance (C4), v) Lack of resilience (C5) and vi) Demography (C6). 

Two or more indicators describe each social aspect (see Table 1). Dwelling (C1) is composed by two 

indicators measuring social vulnerability related to the building in an urban area: Sufficient living area (Dw1) 

and dwelling condition (Dw2). Social development and poverty eradication (C2) consist of seven indicators 

measuring equality and integration in the development of urban settlements: Mortality rate (SD1), Infant 

mortality rate (SD2),  Crime rate (SD3), Urban violence reduction policies (SD4), Poor households (SD5), 

Literacy rate (SD6) and Combined enrollment rate (SD7). Urban Planning (C3) consists of three indicators 

that measure the organization of the urban settlements: i) Growth of informal settlements (UP1), ii) Level of 

urban planning (UP2), and iii) Proportion of homes built in risk prone areas (UP3). Governance (C4) is 

composed of two indicators that measure the level of transparency, liability and efficiency in public policies 

for an urban area; this includes Disaster risk management index, DRMi (G1) [22], and Corruption perception 

index (G2). Lack of resilience (C5) consists of four indicators measuring the capacity response and recovery: 

i) Hospital beds (LR1), ii) Human resources in health (LR2), iii) Relief personnel (LR3), iv) Public space 

(LR4). Finally, the category Demography (C6) consists of two indicators that measure aspects of population 

distribution in urban settlements: i) Urban population density (D1), and ii) Urban population growth (D2).

The number of indicators related to the social context is reduced from 20 to 13 by using a selection process 

based on the determination level for each indicator. This reduction avoids redundancy of the indicators and it 

allows weight or relative importance allocation. 

The determination level or subordination of each indicator is obtained based on the dichotomous question 

“Does the indicator x affect the y indicator?”. In order to process the answers, an nxn square matrix is 

ensemble, where n is the total number of variables. This matrix can be non-symmetric. The components of the 

matrix are 1 for affirmative responses and 0 for negative ones. By using this graph matrix, the influence rate 

(PI) and the dependency rate (PD) are evaluated. PI shows the number of variables that are influenced by the 

variable x; PD shows the number of variables that affect the variable x. In order to prioritize the variables, the 

level of dependence or independence is calculated by using Equation 3. It has a value between -1 (completely 

dependent) to +1 (fully independent). 

  
     

   
 (3) 

 

The indicators are ranked by using the values for the determination level D. The indicators with a negative 

value for the determination level (D < 0) are discarded due to the dependency on the other indicators. Table 1 

shows the 20 social indicators selected and their determination level. Based on these results 13 indicators are 

selected to be considered as the best indicators to describe the social context of an urban area. Two social 

indicators, Dw2 and UP2, are described below [11]. 

The State of dwelling (Dw2) describes the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability in their basic service 

delivery using two definitions according to the available information: 1) Lack of basic services, described by 

the number per thousand of households that are not connected (within their housing unit) to at least three of 

the following services: a) water transported in pipes, b) sewerage, c) electricity, and d) phone. 2) Dwellings 

without good condition represented by the number per thousand of dwellings in deficient, bad or ruins 

condition. This indicator provides useful information to define planning policies to achieve the objective of 

promoting access to basic services. 

The indicator urban planning level (UP2) describes the level of urban land planning in order to meet the needs 

of the population. It corresponds to the category Urban planning (C3) and has the objective of promoting a 



8 
 

geographically balanced structure of human settlements. It is based on qualitative information and is obtained 

from the response of six questions about the urban area: 

1) Are there construction codes? (Yes/Not); 

2) Are the construction codes used for the design and construction of the most of the new buildings? (Totally/ 

Partially/ Not or very little) 

3) Are there risk maps for the area? (Yes/Not); 

4) Has the premise of not build in risk areas been fulfilled? (Yes/Not); 

5) Is disaster insurance of public and private buildings a common practice? (Yes/Not);  

6) Is the disaster insurance mandatory for public buildings? (Yes/ Partially/ Not)  

A numerical value is assigned to each response according to the following g criteria: 1 in the affirmative case 

(Yes or Totally); 2 in the negative case (Not or very little) and 1.5 in the case of the answer "partially". The 

sum of these values will be between 6 and 12, and it gives an idea about the urban planning level as follows: 

When the sum is very close to 6 indicates that the level of urban planning is high or has a good quality; if the 

sum value is close to 12, the level of urban planning is very low.  

 

2.2 Transformation functions for the selected social indicators  

The social indicators selected describe different aspects of the urban area, they have different nature and units, 

as it was already mentioned in section 1. Transformation functions were defined in order to standardize the 

gross values of the indicators into values between 0 and 1. Minimum and maximum values for each function 

were defined taking into account information about different urban centers around the world registered on 

international databases, urban observers and expert opinions.   

Table 2 shows the minimum and maximum values adopted to define the transformation functions for the 13 

social indicators as well as the rise trend for each case (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Transformation function for the value of the social indicator “i” to contributing factor to the aggravating 
coefficient  

The transformation functions may have an up or down trend (see Figure 1). The functions with an uptrend 

have zero value for indicator values between 0 and the minimum value stablished; and they have a one value 

for indicator values greater than the maximum value. Functions with a down trend have the opposite behavior, 

they have value one for indicator values between 0 and the minimum value stablished, and they have a value 

zero for indicator values greater than the maximum value. 

2.3 Evaluation of the aggravating coefficient  

The aggravating coefficient is calculated as the weighted sum of the n contributing factors, this article deals 

with two cases: 13 selected indicators and 6 indicators (one for each category). The participation weights are 

defined by using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). AHP is a technique widely used for multi-

attribute decision making. It allows the application of data, experience, knowledge, and intuition of a logical 

and deep form [22, 36]. The core of AHP is an ordinal pairwise comparison of attributes, indicators in this 

context, in which preference statements are addressed. For a given objective, the comparisons are made per 

pairs of indicators by first posing the question ‘‘Which of the two is the more important?’’ and second ‘‘By 

how much?’’ The strength of preference is expressed on a semantic scale of 1–9, where 1 indicates equality 

between two indicators while a preference of 9 indicates that one indicator is 9 times larger or more important 

than the one to which it is being compared.  

 



11 
 

The relative weights of the indicators are calculated using an eigenvector technique. One of the advantages of 

this method is that it is able to check the consistency of the comparison matrix through the calculation of the 

eigenvalues. This consistency is represented by the Consistency Rate (CR). If the CR is much in excess of 0.1 

the judgements are untrustworthy [36]. 

2.3.1 General case 

The aggravating coefficient (F) is calculated by using the 13 social indicators selected with the determination 

level. The contributing weights are defined applying the AHP with an acceptable Consistency Rate 

(CR=0.0987<0.10), (Table 3).

2.3.2 Simplified case: One indicator by category 

In this case the aggravating coefficient is calculated based on 6 indicators, one for each proposed category 

(n=6). This simplification allows to facilitate the evaluation in two ways: i) by reducing the information 

search, the evaluation depends on the quality of the information, this selection focuses the research in the most 

relevant indicators. ii) The participation weights for each category are obtained by applying the AHP (see 

Table 3) with an acceptable Consistency Rate (CR=0.0866 < 0.1) 

The proposed methodology allows adjusting the participation weights for the contributing factors to F when 

the number of available social indicators in the urban area is greater than 6 and fewer than 13. 

The aggravating coefficient corresponds to a numerical value ranging between zero and one. However, with 

the objective to facilitate the analysis and comparison of different cases, it is convenient to express the 



12 
 

aggravating coefficient in linguistic terms. Thus, in this study the aggravating coefficient is represented by 

using five levels: very low, low, medium, high and very high. The F numerical ranges associated with their 

equivalent language levels are shown in Table 4. 

Table 4 Ranges for each level of seismic physical risk, RFi, Total seismic risk, RT, and the aggravating 

coefficient, F

Low (0.02 a 0.18] (0.10 a 0.30] 

Moderate (0.18 a 0.50] (0.30 a 0.60] 

High (0.50 a 0.82] (0.60 a 0.80] 

Very High (0.82 a 1.00] (0.80 a 1.00] 

3 Holistic evaluation of the seismic risk 

As it was mentioned in section 1, from a holistic approach, the total risk depends on the direct effect, or 

physical risk (RF), and the social context conditions (F), such as the socio-economic fragility and the lack of 

resilience indirect effects, which can to worsen the situation when a hazard event strikes an urban centre [20, 

29]. This article standardizes the values of the Total risk index (RT) of Equation 4 into a range between zero 

and one. 

                   (4) 

Where RFi corresponds to weighted sum: 

    ∑         

 

 

 
(5) 

Where WRFi are weights for each risk factor FRFi  

In order to make the analysis of the obtained results easier, this paper proposes to have pre-established levels 

and range of values for each component in the evaluation, these levels are defined in Table 4. 

In summary, the process to perform the holistic seismic risk assessment proposed in this paper includes the 

following steps: a) to find and process information that represents, on the one hand , the physical damage that 

can occur due to a seismic event, and on the other hand, the social aspects that characterize the urban area; b) 

to evaluate the seismic physical risk index based on the potential physical damages; c) to calculate the 

aggravating coefficient based on the social aspects of the urban area, and finally; d) evaluate the total seismic 

risk index, based on physical seismic risk index and the aggravating coefficient.

4 Examples of application 

The proposed holistic methodology for seismic risk evaluation was applied to two cities; both differ in their 

seismic hazard and location: Merida (Venezuela) and Barcelona (Spain). 

4.1 Holistic seismic risk evaluation in Merida, Venezuela 

The city of Merida, Venezuela, is located in the Nord-Est Venezuela, in the central part of Venezuela Andes. 

It is on a plateau or long terrace within a floodplain (Quaternary sediments), bounded by two mountain ranges: 

the Sierra Nevada in South-East and the Sierra de la Culata in North-West [37, 38].  

Merida, with a total population of less than 250 thousand inhabitants is the capital of both the Estate of 

Merida, and the Libertador municipality. It is made up of 12 of the 15 parishes (in Spanish “Parroquias”) of 

Libertador municipality (Figure 2). The northern part of the city contains the parishes Arias and Milla 

partially, while the southern part contains the parishes: Osuna Rodríguez and Juan Rodríguez Suárez; the 

Eastern: Jacinto Plaza; the Western: Lasso de Vega, Caracciolo Parra Pérez, Mariano Picón Salas and Antonio 

Spinetti Dini; and the inner part of the city contains the parishes: El Llano, Sagrario and Domingo Peña. [39, 

40, 41].

Figure 2. Location map of Merida, Venezuela, with parishes 

In terms of seismicity, Merida is located within an area of high seismic activity (zone 4 and 5) according to the 

seismic classification of structural normative in Venezuela, which divides the country into seven zones with 

different seismic hazard [42]. Below the city runs the major tectonic fault in the western Venezuela, the 

Boconó fault, which forms part of the South American Plate [43]. 

 The events that have shaken violently several populations of Merida state and specifically the city of Merida, 

are the earthquake of 1610, with an estimated Ms = 7.3 magnitude; the earthquake of 1812 with an estimated 

Ms = 7.0 magnitude, and the great earthquake of the Venezuelan Andes, the day 04/28/1894 at 10:00 pm, with 

an estimated magnitude Ms = 7.0 [44]. 

This research considers the seismic hazard in terms of macroseismic intensity, according to the European 

Scale EMS-98 [45], considering two scenarios defined by seismic intensities VIII and IX. In addition, the 

possible effects induced by liquefaction and landslides were evaluated through HAZUS-99 methodology by 

Castillo [40]. These local effects are indicated with an increment in intensity of 0.5 degrees in some areas of 

the city of Merida.

To present the numerical and cartographic results of seismic risk assessment in Merida the political-territorial 

division of parishes is used, because it helps to determine the effect of social context. Parishes are 

demarcations of local character within the territory of a municipality, created in order to decentralize local 

government, promote citizen participation and enhance of local public services. 

4.1.1 Physical risk 

To evaluate the physical risk index of each of the parishes of the city of Merida, damage of elements exposed 

to seismic hazard are estimated, such as: collapsed buildings area, damage to lifelines and human victims 

(dead, injured and people who become homeless). 

Building damages 

Based on the classification of buildings (BTM, Building Typology Matrix) of Risk-UE Project [46], Castillo 

[40] identifies the following seven predominant building typologies in the city of Merida, and their respective 

more plausible vulnerability indexes (between zero and one), indicated between brackets: 

 Reinforced concrete frame buildings, with or without seismic design: RC3.1 (0.402), RC3.2 (0.522), 

RC5 (0.384), NENG_RC (0.685). 

 Adobe or earth houses, with timber or similar roofs and slabs, M2 (0.840). 

 Classic steel structures, with horizontal and vertical elements, S1 (0.363). 

  Type of buildings called “Rancho”, extremely precarious houses built by their habitants with very 

low quality materials and without any design code, R (0.900). 

As in previous studies [40, 47, 48], the metropolitan area of Merida is divided into sectors, considering the 

homogeneity (similarity among buildings), physical barriers (especially the two rivers close to the city) and 

accessibility (bridges and roads). Each sector is divided into several subsectors, such that most of the buildings 

in each subsector belong to the same class of physical vulnerability. This implies that there is no information 

about the specific location of each type of buildings. However, sectors and subsectors provide useful 

information on the distribution of the different structural typologies within them. 

In this research, the database of buildings used by Castillo [40] (16,147 buildings) was completed, 

incorporating all existing buildings in a sector (Los Curos) of the parish Osuna Rodriguez, which had not been 

considered in the previous studies [40, 47]. These new buildings were characterized with the classification 

matrix of buildings of the Risk-UE Project, adopted for the city of Merida in Castillo [36]. Therefore, the total 



16 
 

number of buildings considered in Merida is 17,664 and the percentage distribution of typologies in the city is: 

40.27% for NENG-RC, 33.03% for RC3.1, 15.20% for M2 and 9.86%, for RC3.2, while each of the R, S1 and 

RC5 typologies exhibit a percentage less than 1%. Table 5 shows the distribution of typologies by Parish.

Using the Vulnerability Index Method of the Risk-UE Project [46, 49] the damage probability matrices were 

established for each representative typology of the city for macroseismic intensities VIII and IX-X, and 

considering five damage states plus a no-damage state according to the macroseismic scale ESM-98. Then, 

using the damage probability matrices, the potential destroyed area for each parish to seismic intensities VIII 

and IX was estimated [11]. 

Lifelines 

For the city of Merida-Venezuela potential damage in the system of potable water and the damage to the road 

system was evaluated. Based on the study of Astorga [50] about seismic damage of water pipelines network in 

Merida, a correspondence between the ten pressure zones and parishes of the city of Merida was performed. 

The descriptor of physical risk was estimated for the drinking water system, in terms of tears per kilometer in 

the different parishes for two seismic intensities VIII and IX [11]. The average damage in the transportation 

system was established as a weighted average of damage, depending on the length road affected by each of the 

levels of ground motion (peak ground displacement, PGD) for a given seismic intensity. For this purpose, 

different systems of urban roads were categorized, based on HAZUS-99 [3, 11]. 



17 
 

Human casualties  

It was considered appropriate to use the model of Risk-UE Project [51, 52, 53] to determine the number of 

victims given that, the area under study has a moderate seismic hazard [42] and the basic data that this model 

requires was available.  

Index of physic risk  

Once the physical risk of exposed elements in the parishes of Merida are estimated, they become contributing 

factors to physical seismic risk, applying the corresponding transformation functions. Subsequently, according 

to equation 5, for m= 6 categories and their respective weights wRFi, values of seismic physical risk index are 

obtained for each of the parishes of the city in two seismic scenarios (intensity VIII and IX) (Figure 3). 

Table 6 shows the values estimated for the physical damage (intensity IX) by parish for Merida: percentage of 

destroyed area (XRF1), dead people per thousand inhabitants (‰) (XRF2), injured people (‰) (XRF3), homeless 

(‰) (XRF4), potential damage in the system of potable water (tears per kilometer) (XRF5), and damage for the 

road system (percentage affected of the road system)  (XRF6). Table 7 shows the obtained values for the 

physical risk factors based on the damage estimations of Table 6 and the Physical risk index, RF.

4.1.2 Social Context 

In order to calculate 11 of the 13 prevailing social indicators proposed in the methodology described in this 

article, for the city of Merida, information from different urban observers was used. 

Such urban observers were: Statistics Institute of Venezuela [54]; interviews with local experts in risk 

management (to establish the risk management index for 2010) and information from various local researchers 



19 
 

[39, 55, 56]. Information from Firefighters Group of Merida (internal census), and Andean Corporation 

(CORPOANDES) was also used. CORPOANDES, in the frame of the Simon Bolivar national project called 

Geographic Information System of the Region of the Andes (SIGRA), collected, organized, updated and 

generated statistical and cartographical information of different socio-economic aspects of Tachira, Merida 

and Trujillo [57].  

The methodology was adapted to the city of Merida establishing 11 (n = 11) contributors to aggravation.Share 

weights are set using the AHP. Once the different prevailing social indicators of Merida are established, they 

become contributor factors of the aggravation generated by the social context, applying the corresponding 

transformation functions (section 2.2). Then, the numerical value of the aggravating coefficient (F) for is 

parish is obtained for the following two cases:  

Case 1: adaptation of the general case of the proposed methodology, considering eleven factors contributing to 

the aggravation (n = 11) with their weights of participation (Table 8). Table 9 shows the values of the 

prevailing social indicators and Table 10 the calculated contributing factors, for the parishes. 

Case 2: considering a factor for each of the six categories proposed (n = 6), with the weights given in the 

proposed methodology (Table 3). In this case, the aggravating coefficient corresponds to the combination of 

the six factors F(Dw1), F(SD5), F(UP2), F(G1), F(LR1) and F(D1) (Table 2). In both cases, the numerical 

values of the aggravating coefficient for each of the parishes studied in the city of Merida, correspond to the 

average level of aggravation (range from 0.30 to 0.60) (Figure 4). 

Table 8. Weights participation (Wi) of the contributing factors to the aggravating coefficient by n =11

In Case 1 (n = 11), the parish of Sagrario has the highest aggravating coefficient and Domingo Peña parish has 

the lowest. In Case 2 (n = 6) the highest and lowest aggravating coefficient correspond to Antonio Spinetti 

Dini and Juan Rodriguez Suarez parishes, respectively.

case (case 1) for proposed methodology with 11 indicators, and for the simplified case (case 2)  

4.1.3 Total seimic risk 

The total seismic risk obtained with Equation 4, in each of the parishes of the city, for VIII and IX seismic 

intensity scenarios is shown in Figures 5 and 6 respectively. The values of total seismic risk are greater than 

physical seismic risk values, due to the average level of aggravation, which is generated by the social context 

of each of the parishes of the city.  

The total seismic risk level is a level greater than the physical seismic risk level for the scenario of intensity 

VIII (Moderate level regarding to Low level.) in El Llano and Arias parishes (see arrows in Figure 5). Other 

parishes have a total seismic risk level similar to the level of physical seismic risk. For intensity IX parishes 

which increase one risk level relative to seismic physical seismic risk, from Moderate to High level, are: 

Antonio Spinetti Dini, Caracciolo Parra Perez, Osuna Rodríguez, and from Low to Moderate level: Juan 

Rodriguez Suarez and Mariano Picon Salas parishes; while the Very High level of risk remains unaltered in 

the parish Sagrario (see arrows in Figure 6). 

The level of total seismic risk for the scenario of intensity IX is much greater than for the scenario of intensity 

VIII. The total seismic risk increases at least two levels in almost all parishes except Mariano Picon, Lasso de 

la Vega and Juan Rodriguez Suárez, because the predominant building types in these parishes are less 

vulnerable to seismic hazard. It should be noted that parishes Antonio Spinetti Dini, Caracciolo Parra and 

Rodriguez Osuna increase their level of total seismic risk from Low to Very High. The parishes of Arias, 

Domingo Peña, El Llano and Milla move from Moderate to Very High level. Parishes less affected by the 

aggravation coefficient (up only one level) are: Juan Rodriguez Suarez and Mariano Picon Salas.

4.2 Holistic seismic risk evaluation in Barcelona-Spain 

Barcelona is the political and economic capital of Catalonia (Spain), with 1.6million inhabitants and around 

71000 buildings and 849700 dwellings according to the official statistics corresponding to the year 2011. It is 

located in a region considered low to moderate seismicity zone [53]. The historical peak intensities occurred in 

its territory varied between VI and IX in the EMS-98 scale. There are few recorded acceleration data. The 

maximum perceived intensity in the city is estimated between VI and VII intensity. The city is organized in 10 

districts, of which Ciutat Vella and Eixample are the oldest and show the greatest expected vulnerability and 

damage [58, 59]. Ciutat Vella means Old City and is the downtown of Barcelona. 



23 
 

4.2.1 Seismic physical risk  

Data about seismic physical damages of Barcelona were taken from the technical report [60]. This report 

shows the results of seismic impact simulations for different scenarios on the buildings and the population of 

the city, in order to review the Municipal Emergency Action Plan to seismic risk (PAEM, Plan de Actuación 

de Emergencia Municipal in Spanish). The study was based on the cadastral data of 2008 provided by the 

Municipal Institute of Computer Science of the City Council of Barcelona. The seismic action was considered 

in terms of macroseismic intensity (intensity V, VI and VII), according to the European level EMS'98 [45]. 

The vulnerability of buildings were characterized by the method of level 1, called Vulnerability Index Method 

[46, 53], developed under the Risk-UE project [4]. 

The study results are available for each scenario at district and neighborhood scale, among which are: collapse 

or destroyed areas and human casualties, such an injured and dead people and homeless [60]. Processing these 

seismic data descriptors we obtained physical damage for the seismic scenarios defined by intensities VI and 

VII (Figure 7). The possible amplification due to effects soil have not been considered, they should be 

understood as mean intensities felt in the city in case of earthquake. Physical seismic damage descriptors 

associated with vital lines were obtained from Lantada et al. [53]. 

The six descriptors of physical seismic risk, which allowed the quantitative evaluation of the physical seismic 

risk, were obtained in the case of Barcelona to the intensity VI and VII (Figure 7). 

Table 11 shows the values estimated for the physical damage (intensity VII) by district for Barcelona: 

percentage of damaged area (XFR1), injured people per thousand of inhabitants (‰) (XRF2), dead people (‰) 

(XRF3), homeless (‰) (XRF4), average damage in the system of potable water (XRF5), and percentage affected 

of the road system (XRF6). Table 12 shows the obtained values for the physical risk factors based on the 

damage estimations of Table 11 and the Physical risk index, RF.

4.2.2 Social Context 

The information to establish prevailing social indicators for Barcelona- Spain, was obtained from local urban 

observatories, such as Statistical Institute of Catalonia that collects basic statistical information of Barcelona 

annually [61] and local experts in risk management [62]. 

Table 13 shows the values of the prevailing social indicators for the districts of the city Barcelona-Spain and 

the six contributing factors to aggravation, one per category, associated to the prevailing social indicators 

available are presented in Table 14. These factors allow obtaining the aggravating coefficient (F). It is noted 

that all city districts have values of aggravation at a Medium level, except the district of Les Corts, with Low 

level.

4.2.3 Total Seismic Risk 

The total seismic risk for all the districts of Barcelona-Spain increases relative to seismic physical risk for both 

scenarios (Figure 8). Especially, the districts of Eixample and Gràcia went from Low to Moderate level for the 

scenario of intensity VII. The remaining districts maintained the same level of seismic physical risk (Ciutat 

Vella in the Middle level, and the other districts in Low level). For the scenario of intensity VI the total 

seismic risk level does not change category in relation to the physical risk in any district.

Range RT ≤ 0.02 0.02 < RT ≤ 0.18 0.18 < RT ≤ 0.50 0.50 < RT ≤ 0.82 0.82 < RT ≤ 1.00

5 Conclusions 

The social context can aggravate the physical seismic risk; therefore it is desirable to establish a methodology 

to evaluate it. Once this estimation is done, it is possible to implement actions to improve the social context, in 

order not to aggravate the situation that could be generated by an earthquake that interacts with the 

vulnerability of any urban area. 

The proposed methodology for holistic seismic risk assessment improves prior methodologies because their 

results are standard and easy to interpret (risk has values between 0 and 1). Also, it is expected that necessary 

social indicators will be easier to obtain because they have been selected from the indicators used by urban 

observatories of United Nations and other social researchers; such as indicators of the Habitat Agenda  (1996) 

[33], Istanbul+5 (2001) [34], Millennium Development Goals [35] and Carreño [19].  A total of 20 indicators 

were defined to describe the social context in urban areas. These indicators were classified according to social 

item they describe, in the following six categories: Dwelling (C1), Social development and Poverty 

eradication (C2), Urban planning (C3), Governance (C4), Lack of resilience (C5) and Demography (C6).  

Applying the determination level analysis thirteen prevailing social indicators are selected: Sufficient living 

area (Dw1); State of dwelling (Dw2); Poor households (SD5); Literacy Rate (SD6); Growth of informal 

settlements (UP1); Level urban planning (UP2); Dwellings built in location subject to risk (UP3); Disaster risk 

management index (G1); Hospital beds (LR1); Human resources in health (LR2); Relief personnel (LR3); 

Population density (D1); Urban population growth (D2). 

In the event that not all information is available for the 13 indicators, the methodology may be simplified by 

using one social indicator per category. These indicators should be selected based on the determination level 

analysis as follows: Sufficient living area for C1 category, Poor households (C2), Growth of informal 

settlements (C3), Disaster risk management index (C4), Hospital beds (C5) and Population density (C6). 

In summary, the resolution level for the application of this methodology depends on the available information 

in the urban area. Therefore, the aggravation coefficient F can be established by: a) General case (n = 13), 

with the 13 prevailing social indicators or b) Simplified case by only six predominant indicators (n = 6), one 

for each category and higher level of determination. Obviously, according to available information of the case 

of study the number of indicators could be between 6 and 13. 



28 
 

The proposed standard methodology for estimating the coefficient of aggravation (F) in urban areas has been 

applied to the city of Merida in Venezuela and the European city of Barcelona in Spain. In both cities, this 

methodology was easy to apply, despite being two cities with very different characteristics and available 

information. Urban observers in both cities allowed to establish data required for simplified case (six 

predominant social indicators). In the case of Merida the methodology was also apply by using 11 indicators. 

Therefore, the proposed methodology to measure the social context is easy to adapt to study of different urban 

areas.  

In both cities the same social indicators were used for categories C3 to C6: level of urban planning, disaster 

risk management index, hospital beds and population density, respectively. For category C1 Sufficient living 

area was used for Merida and State of dwelling for Barcelona; and in the case of C2: Poor households was 

used for Merida and Literacy rate for Barcelona. In both cities the Disaster risk management index (G1) 

showed an appreciable level of performance [22]. 

The results for Merida had on average a higher contribution to the aggravating factor (F) from hospital beds, 

disaster risk management index and level of urban planning, compared to the contribution in Barcelona. The 

contribution of population density indicator to F in Merida had lower values than Barcelona. 

The physical seismic risk in the city of Barcelona was on average very low for the scenario of intensity VI and 

low for the intensity VII. While in Merida it was low and high for the scenarios of intensity of VIII and IX, 

respectively. A similarity was observed in the level of aggravation coefficient in both cities (moderate level). 

Finally, the average values of total seismic risk (RT) in both cities were moderate and very high in the city of 

Merida for scenarios of intensities VIII and IX, respectively; and very low and low in Barcelona for the 

scenarios of intensities of VI and VIII, respectively.  

Despite the similarity in the level of aggravation coefficient, the social context of each city would affect the 

physical seismic risk in a different way in the scenarios with high intensities. Barcelona would not be affected 

significantly by the social context, since in most districts (eight of ten) the level of total seismic risk remained 

the same level of physical seismic risk (RFi) for the intensity VII. While the social context in Merida would 

significantly worsen the physical seismic risk, since in five of the eleven parishes, the total seismic risk goes 

up a level with respect to RFi level for intensity IX.
