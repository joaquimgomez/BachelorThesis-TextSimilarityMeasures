Laminated	composite	beams	are	basic	components	for	several	structural	engineering	applications,	due	to	their	excellent	mechanical	properties,	namely	high	specific	strength	and	stiffness,	long	fatigue	life,

wear	resistance	and	enhanced	design	freedom	on	a	micro-	and	macro-mechanical	level.	The	behavior	of	laminated	beams	is	governed	by	a	wide	number	of	parameters	due	to	their	complex	behavior.	Moreover,	specific

problems	arise	such	as	delamination	and	complex	damage	and	failure	mechanisms	that	need	a	proper	modeling	for	an	accurate	appraisal	of	the	study	of	their	mechanics.	In	particular,	as	it	is	shown	by	Carrera	[1–2],	a

slope	discontinuity	on	the	displacement	field	occurs	at	the	interface	between	two	perfectly	bonded	layers	because	of	the	transverse	anisotropy,	i.e.	the	difference	in	layer-wise	transverse	shear	and	normal	moduli.	This

is	known	as	the	ZigZag	(ZZ)	phenomenon.

Considering	 theses	 aspects	 a	 number	 of	 theories	 have	 been	 proposed	 for	 the	 analysis	 of	 composite	 laminates.	 Theories	 used	 for	 the	 through	 –thickness	 variation	 of	 the	 state	 variables	 (unknowns	 are	 of

displacement	type)	can	be	classified	as:	equivalent	single	layer	models	(ESL),	layer-wise	models	(LW)	and	zigzag	models	(ZZ).	The	well-described	unified	formulation,	initially	presented	by	Carrera	[3]	and	extended	by

Demasi	[4–8],	describes	precisely	and	clearly	the	models,	types	and	class	of	these	theories.	

In	the	ESL	theories	the	assumed	displacements	vary	continuously	across	the	laminate	thickness	and	the	number	of	unknowns	is	independent	of	the	number	of	layers.	ESL	models	include	mainly	three	major

Abstract

In	this	work	a	kinematics	for	laminated	beams	enriched	with	a	refined	formulation	ZigZag	(RZT),	originally	presented	by	Tessler	et	al.	in	2007,	introduced	in	a	hierarchical	one	dimensional	type	“p”

finite	element	is	presented.	The	finite	element	employs	Lagrange	polynomials	for	the	approximation	of	the	degrees	of	freedom	of	the	ends	(nodes)	and	orthogonal	Gram-Schmidt	polynomials	to	the	internal

degrees	of	 freedoms.	This	 finite	element	allows	a	very	 low	discretization,	 is	 free	of	 shear	 locking	and	behaves	very	well	when	 the	analysis	of	 laminated	composites	with	accurate	determination	of	 local

stresses	and	strains	at	laminar	level	is	necessary.

This	element	has	been	validated	in	the	analysis	of	laminated	beams	with	various	sequences	of	symmetric	and	asymmetric	stacking,	studying	in	each	case	its	accuracy	and	stability.														Keywords:

categories,	 i.e.,	 the	classical	theory	(CT),	the	first-order	theory	(FDT),	and	the	higher-order	theory	(HOT).	The	CT	known	as	Euler–Bernoulli	beam	theory	is	the	simplest	one	and	is	 inaccurate	for	reasonably	thick

laminated	beams	and/or	for	highly	anisotropic	composite	beams.	The	inaccuracy	is	due	to	neglecting	the	transverse	shear	strains	 in	the	 laminate.	The	FDT	by	Timoshenko	[9]	considers	constant	transverse	shear

strain	distribution	through	the	beam	thickness	and,	thus,	a	shear	correction	factor	has	to	be	incorporated	to	adjust	the	transverse	shear	stiffness.	The	accuracy	of	FDT	solutions	depend	on	the	shear	correction	factor

which	cannot	in	general	be	determined	a	priori	apart	from	very	special	cases	[10].	Moreover,	FDT	produces	piecewise	constant	transverse	shear	stresses	that	violate	the	interlaminar	continuity	(IC)	conditions	and	the

traction-free	conditions	at	the	top	and	bottom	surfaces.	To	overcome	these	shortcomings	and	to	avoid	the	use	of	shear	correction	factors,	a	number	of	high-order	theories	with	different	shear	strain	shape	functions

were	introduced.	In	general,	the	cross	section	is	allowed	to	deform	in	any	form	by	including	higher	order	terms	in	the	axiomatic	expansion	of	the	displacement	field	along	the	beam	direction	(x-axis)	as	a	suitable

smooth	function	of	transverse	direction	(z-axis).	In	this	sense	different	shape	functions	have	been	proposed	such	as	polynomial	[11–14],	trigonometric	[15–18],	exponential	[19–21]	and	hyperbolic	functions	[22,23].

Carrera	et	al.	[24]	discussed	a	number	of	refined	beam	theories	which	were	obtained	expanding	the	unknown	displacement	variables	over	the	beam	section	axes	by	adopting	Taylor’s	polynomials,	trigonometric	series,

exponential,	hyperbolic	and	zigzag	functions,	by	using	the	Unified	Formulation	introduced	by	Carrera	[3].	A	class	of	theories	often	included	into	HOT	are	the	advanced	higher	order	theories,	denoted	as	AHOT,	where

transverse	normal	strains	are	 incorporated	by	extending	 the	expansion	of	 the	 transverse	displacement.	For	 instance,	Vidal	et	al.	 [25]	proposed	 the	approximation	of	 the	displacement	 field	as	a	sum	of	 separated

functions	of	axial	and	transverse	coordinate	by	adopting	the	Proper	Generalized	Decomposition	procedure.	HOT	gives	a	continuous	variation	of	the	transverse	shear	strain	across	the	thickness	but	shows	discontinuity

in	the	shear	stress	distribution	at	the	layer	interfaces	(if	they	are	computed	through	the	constitutive	equations)	due	to	different	values	of	shear	rigidity	at	the	adjacent	layers.	But	the	actual	behavior	of	a	composite

laminate	is	opposite	i.e.,	the	transverse	shear	stress	must	be	continuous	at	the	layer	interface	and	the	corresponding	strain	may	be	discontinuous	[26].

In	LW	models	[27–34]	the	displacement	field	within	each	layer	is	prescribed	and	compatibility	conditions	are	applied	between	adjacent	layers	in	the	laminate	to	recover	the	model	of	the	laminate	as	a	whole.

These	models	provide	realistic	descriptions	of	kinematics	at	the	ply	level	and	they	have	the	capacity	to	take	into	account	the	zigzag	effect.	However,	LW	approaches	suffer	from	an	excessive	number	of	displacement

variables	in	proportion	to	the	number	of	layers	and	hence	they	are	too	expensive	in	terms	of	computational	cost	and	hardly	appropriate	for	practical	applications.

ZigZag	models	include	a	set	of	layer	independent	theories	in	which	a	LW	discontinuous	function	is	a	priori	selected	to	enrich	the	kinematical	model	in	such	way	that	the	interface	conditions	are	met.	So,	in

these	theories,	the	in-plane	displacements	have	piece-wise	variation	across	the	beam	thickness	and	the	number	of	unknowns	results	independent	of	the	number	of	layer.	Examples	of	ZZ	theories	are	those	found	in

articles	published	by	Murakami	[35],	Lee	et	al.	[36],	Cho	and	Paramerter	[37],	Cho	and	Averill	[38],	Vidal	and	Polit	[39,40].

The	research	activity	about	the	modeling	of	laminated	structural	members	and	the	corresponding	analytical	or	numerical	solutions	are	numerous.	In	particular,	as	this	paper	is	devoted	to	ZigZag	models	a

complete	and	extensive	assessment	about	the	subject	can	be	found	in	Carrera	[1].	Other	reference	in	the	topic	is	the	review	paper	by	Chakrabarti	et	al.	[26].	On	the	other	side,	Groh	and	Weaver	[41]	present,	in	the

article	introduction,	a	comprehensive	overview	of	the	different	theories	that	are	used	for	the	analysis	of	highly	heterogeneous	laminated	beams.

Many	ZigZag	theories	requires	 continuity	for	the	deflection	field,	which	is	a	drawback	versus	simpler	 c (Insert	a	space	after	equation)ontinuous	FEM	approximations	[42].	Tessler	et	al.	[43–45]	developed	a

refined	zigzag	theory	(RZT)	that	allows	the	use	of	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)continuous	interpolation	for	all	the	kinematic	variables.	The	kinematics	of	RZT	is	essentially	that	of	FDT	enhanced	by	a	zigzag	field

which	has	the	property	of	vanishing	on	the	top	and	bottom	surface	of	the	laminate.

Along	with	the	development	of	beam	theories,	there	has	been	significant	development	towards	the	solution	methodologies.	Analytical	solutions	are	applicable	for	a	few	particular	classes	of	beam	configuration

[46,47].	 The	 development	 of	 computational	 technologies	 makes	 it	 quite	 possible	 to	 implement	 numerical	 methods	 for	 the	 practical	 applications.	 Among	 these,	 FEM	 is	 most	 popular	 and	 versatile	 method	 for

investigating	the	structural	behavior	of	arbitrary	shaped	components.	In	this	context	Oñate	et	al.	[42]	developed	a	simple	2-noded	beam	element	based	on	the	RZT	theory,	where	shear	locking	is	avoided	using	reduced

integration	on	selected	terms	of	the	shear	stiffness	matrix.	The	classical	version	or	h	version	of	FEM	was	used	in	this	paper,	where	the	accuracy	of	the	solution	is	achieved	by	refinement	of	finite	element	mesh.

Unlike	the	h	FEM	version,	in	the	p	version	of	FEM	the	mesh	remains	constant	while	the	degree	of	the	interpolation	polynomial	is	gradually	increased	to	the	desired	accuracy	[48].	The	degrees	of	freedom	of	a	p

element	are	constituted	by	the	degrees	of	freedom	of	the	one-dimensional	element	ends	(nodes)	and	the	amplitudes	of	the	shape	functions	within	the	element.	The	p-version	is	characterized	by	being	more	robust	than

the	version	h	[49],	in	other	words	the	performance	of	the	p-version	is	much	less	sensitive	to	input	data	tan	the	h-version.	For	example,	the	p	version	allows	proper	treatment	of	elements	with	high	slenderness,	as	it	is

free	of	shear	locking.	This	is	especially	important	in	the	analysis	of	laminated	composite	beams,	where	a	more	rigorous	stress	analysis	at	laminar	and	inter-laminar	level	is	necessary.	Several	demonstrative	examples

and	theoretical	proofs	of	the	advantages	of	the	p-version	FEM	can	be	found	in	the	literature	[48,50–54].	Recall	that	the	advantages	of	the	p	version	are	not	limited	to	the	greater	convergence	rate.	In	fact,	with	h

methods,	the	accuracy	of	the	solution	is	determined	by	executing	several	analyses	with	different	meshes,	an	expensive	and	time-consuming	process,	both	because	of	the	computational	cost	and	because	of	the	operator

time	required	to	define	the	different	models.	In	p-convergent	approximations,	the	number	of	finite	elements	is	determined	by	the	geometry	and	is	small	[55].

		 	 		 	

		 	



In	this	paper	a	hierarchical	one-dimensional	finite	element,	based	on	the	ZigZag	refined	theory	by	Tessler	et	al.	[43–45]	is	proposed.	This	finite	element	has	two	end	nodes	and	four	degrees	of	freedom	per

node.	To	approximate	the	kinematics	variables	of	this	formulation	Lagrange	polynomials	as	local	support	functions	are	used,	and	orthogonal	polynomials	generated	by	means	of	recurrence	Gram-Schmidt	expressions

[58–59]	are	employed	as	functions	of	hierarchical	enrichment	[60–63].	It	is	necessary	to	emphasize	here	that	one	of	the	main	novelty	of	the	proposed	model	is	the	obtaining	of	a	hierarchical	finite	element	within	the

framework	of	 a	Zig-Zag	 theory,	 considering	 local	 support	 functions	of	 type	 and	achieving	 a	 robust	 finite	 element	 free	 of	 shear	 locking.	Besides,	 the	developed	 formulation	 is	 appropriated	 for	 the	 analysis	 of

symmetric	and	non-symmetric	laminated	beams	in	a	general	and	unified	way,	since	all	mechanical	coupling	are	considered.	Another	important	and	salient	feature	of	the	developed	model	is	the	capacity	it	has	for	its

application	to	the	delamination	study	as	will	be	seen	in	Section	8.

The	proposed	finite	element	has	been	computationally	implemented.	To	verify	the	results,	the	order	of	the	approximation	can	be	selectively	increased.	This	operation	is	carried	out	very	efficiently	because	it	is

not	necessary	to	generate	a	new	mesh	and	because	the	new	linear	stiffness	matrix	contains	the	preceding	one.	It	is	demonstrated	that	the	proposed	hierarchical	finite	element	is	free	of	shear	locking	and,	in	order	to

assess	its	accuracy	and	stability,	it	has	been	applied	to	the	analysis	of	laminated	beams	with	symmetrical	and	non-symmetrical	stacking	sequence	with	different	boundary	conditions.

2	Formulation	of	the	mechanical	problem
Let	us	consider	a	laminated	beam	of	total	thickness	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)and	length	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)as	shown	in	Fig.	1.	The	Cartesian	coordinate	system	( (delte	the	space	before	x) )

is	taken	such	that	the	 plane	( ) (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)	coincides	with	the	midplane	of	the	beam,	the	 axis	is	along	the	width	( )	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)of	the	beam;	resulting	in	a	beam	domain	

.	The	displacement	vector	is	 and	the	displacement	components	along	each	coordinate	axis	are	designed	by	 .	The	laminated	beam	is	composed	of	

layers	of	different	linearly	elastic	materials,	being	each	layer	orthotropic	in	the	beam	axes.	The	integer	 , (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)	used	as	superscript	or	subscript,	denotes	the	layer	number	from	the	bottom	to

the	top	of	the	beam;	thus	the	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)layer	corresponds	to	 and	its	thickness	is	 .

The	one	dimensional	constitutive	equations	of	the	kth	layer	of	an	orthotropic	material	are	given	by

where	 (Align	 the	 equation	with	 the	 text.	 Please	 do	 that	with	 all	 the	 equation	 included	 into	 the	 text)is	 stress	 vector,	 is	 the	 strain	 vector,	 and	 the	 constitutive	 one-dimensional	 laws	 are	 given	by	 the	 elastic	 stiffness

matrix	 for	the	kth	layer.

Taking	 into	account	 the	classical	assumption	of	negligible	 transverse	normal	 stress	 ( ) (The	 parenthesis	must	 be	 in	 the	 same	 line	 as	 equation),	 the	 longitudinal	modulus	 is	 expressed	 from	 the	 three

dimensional	constitutive	laws	by

where	 are	orthotropic	three-dimensional	elastic	moduli	[56].

The	transverse	shear	stress	modulus	is	given	by

The	general	weak	form	of	the	boundary	value	problem	for	the	beam	shown	in	Fig.	1,	considering	Eq.	(1)	and	a	virtual	displacement	vector	 ,	is	given	by	the	classical	virtual	work	expression

where	 and	 are,	respectively,	the	prescribed	body	and	surface	forces	applied	on	 ,	 is	the	virtual	strain,	 denotes	symmetric	gradient	and	 denotes	the	corresponding	transpose.

Substituting	Eq.	(1)	into	the	weak	form	of	the	boundary	value	problem,	Eq.	(4)	results:

Eq.	(5)	will	be	used	in	Section	4	as	the	starting	point	for	the	proposed	hierarchical	finite	element	approximations.

3	Bases	of	the	refined	zigzag	theory
The	kinematics	of	the	refined	zigzag	theory	(RZT)	proposed	by	Tessler	et	al.	[43–45]	are	essentially	those	of	FDT	enhanced	by	an	axial	zigzag	displacement	function	 (Fig.	2),	which	results	of	a	zig-zag

field	 multiplied	by	a	piecewise	continuous	transverse	function	 ,	as	follows

where

The	key	attributes	of	RZT	are,	first,	the	zigzag	function	vanishes	at	the	top	and	bottom	surfaces	of	the	beam	and	does	not	require	full	shear-stress	continuity	across	the	laminated-beam	depth.	Second,	all

boundary	conditions,	including	the	fully	clamped	condition,	can	be	modeled	adequately.	And	third,	the	theory	requires	only	 -continuous	kinematics	for	finite	element	modeling.	Overall,	the	theory	appears	as	a

natural	extension	of	Timoshenko	theory	to	laminated	composite	beams.

Within	each	layer	the	zigzag	function,	depicted	in	Fig.	1(a),	is	expressed	as

where	 and	 are	the	zigzag	function	values	of	 and	 interfaces	respectively,	being	 ,	and	 .

The	zigzag	slope	 ,	is	denoted	by	 and	it	is	computed	from	Eq.	(8)	as

In	this	theory	the	zigzag	slope	 is	defined	by	the	difference	between	the	transverse	shear	rigidity	of	a	layer	 ,	and	the	effective	transverse	shear	rigidity	 of	the	entire	layup,

being

Introducing	Eqs.	(9)	and	(10)	into	Eq.	(8)	the	expression	for	the	zigzag	function	for	the	RZT	is	obtained,

Note	that	RZT	theory	does	not	enforce	the	continuity	of	the	transverse	shear	stress	across	the	section.	This	is	consistent	with	kinematic	freedom	inherent	in	the	lower	order	kinematic	approximation	of	the

underlying	beam	theory.	The	reader	can	obtain	a	more	detailed	description	of	the	RZT	in	Tessler	et	al.	[43–45]	and	Oñate	et	al.	[42].

4	Hierarchical	finite	beam	element	for	the	refined	zigzag	theory
4.1	Shape	functions

The	unknown	functions	 and	 in	Eq.	(6)	are	discretized	using	one	finite	element	according	to	the	hierarchical	version	of	FEM	(p-FEM).	The	natural	coordinate	 is	used	along	the	length	of	the	beam,	so	node

1	corresponds	to	 ( )	and	node	2	corresponds	to	 ( ).	The	proposed	one	–	dimensional	approximation	is	given	by

where	 are	the	number	of	shape	functions;	 are	the	generalized	unknowns	displacements	used	to	approximate	each	kinematic	variable	and	 are	the	shape	functions.

These	shape	functions,	 ,	are	polynomials	expressions	and	they	can	be	classified	in	two	groups	[57],	namely:	nodal	modes	for	 and	internal	modes	for	 .

The	nodal	modes	are	the	classical	support	local	Lagrange	polynomials,	i.e.:

where	 is	the	local	coordinate	of	the	 node.

The	 internal	modes	 are	 purely	 local	 and	 vanish	 at	 the	 ends	 of	 the	 element	 (beam).	 This	 feature	 is	 highly	 significant	 since	 these	 functions	 only	 give	 additional	 freedom	 to	 the	 interior	 of	 the	 element.	 The	 employment	 of

orthogonal	polynomials	generated	by	the	Gram-Schmidt	recurrence	expressions	are	proposed	in	this	work	[58–60].	The	first	internal	mode	is	obtained	as	a	simpler	and	lower	degree	polynomial	that	satisfies	that	hierarchical	modes

contribute	only	to	the	internal	components	of	the	displacement	field	of	the	element,	and	do	not	therefore	affect	to	these	components	at	the	end	nodes.	So	the	first	hierarchical	(internal)	mode	results:

This	basis	polynomial	satisfies	 as	required.

The	remaining	hierarchical	modes	are	obtained	by	the	Gram-Schmidt	procedure,	starting	from	the	basis	polynomial	(Eq.	(15)),	as	follows

where

The	coefficients	of	the	polynomials	are	recomputed	so	that	result	orthonormal	polynomials:

The	application	of	this	procedure	ensures	that	higher-order	polynomials	(hierarchical	modes)	satisfy,	automatically,	the	same	conditions	as	the	basis	polynomial.

Taking	into	account	the	features	of	the	nodal	and	internal	modes,	the	first	two	generalized	displacement	unknowns	are	the	values	of	the	kinematic	variables	at	the	end	nodes,	i.e.: and	 ,	being	 ;

namely	 ,	 ,,	 ,	

.

The	shape	functions	 ,	as	stated	above,	are	the	same	for	all	kinematics	variables,	however	it	is	possible	to	use	different	number	of	approximation	functions	for	each	variable	( ).	Finally,	Eq.	(13)	is	now	written	in	a

matrix	form,	as	follows

where

Note	that	the	dimensions	of	 depends	on	the	number	of	shape	functions	for	each	kinematic	variable	( ).

4.2	Expression	of	strains	and	stress
The	strains	for	the	laminated	beam	(Fig.	1),	considering	the	RZT	theory	(Fig.	2)	given	by	Eqs.	(6)	and	(7)	are:

where	 Eq.	 (24)	 contains	 the	 axial	 elongations	 ( ),	 the	 pseudo-curvature	 ( )	 and	 the	 derivative	 of	 the	 function	 zigzag	 amplitude	 ( );	 and	 in	 Eq.	 (25)	 is	 the	 average	 transverse	 shear	 stress	 of

Timoshenko	beam	theory	and	 is	constant	across	each	layer.

Eqs.	(24)	and	(25)	can	be	written	as

Shear	locking	is	due	to	the	inability	of	shear	deformable	elements	to	accurately	model	the	bending	within	an	element	under	a	state	of	zero	transverse	shearing	strain.	When	thin	beams	are	analyzed	by	the

shear	deformable	elements,	the	energy	due	to	transverse	shear	strains	must	vanish.	Numerically	this	is	equivalent	to	requiring	the	product	of	the	shear	stiffness	matrix	and	the	displacement	vector	be	zero.	Therefore,

in	order	to	obtain	a	nontrivial	solution,	the	shear	stiffness	matrix	must	be	singular.	One	way	to	achieve	the	singularity	of	the	transverse	shear	stiffness	matrix	is	to	use	an	order	of	numerical	integration	lower	than	is

necessary	to	evaluate	the	integrals	exactly.	This	procedure,	i.e.,	reduced	integration	of	transverse	shear	stiffnesses	has	been	adopted	by	Oñate	et	al.	[42]	for	overcoming	the	shear	locking	problem	in	their	linear	two-

noded	beam	element	based	on	RZT.	P-version	of	FEM	 is	much	 less	prone	of	 shear	 locking	because	of	 the	 increase	of	 the	number	of	 terms	 in	 the	enrichment	basis	 functions,	 i.	 e.,	p-refinement.	Moreover,	 it	was

theoretically	and	numerically	shown,	that	the	p-version	is	free	of	locking	effects,	if	the	polynomial	degree	is	chosen	to	be	moderately	high.

In	order	 to	show	that	 the	new	PRZ	element	 is	 free	of	shear	 locking,	 the	performance	of	 this	element	 in	 the	analysis	of	a	cantilever	beam	of	 length	 under	an	end	point	 load	of	 value	 (Fig.	3a)	 is

presented.	For	the	clamped	end	all	the	nodal	degrees	of	freedoms	at	the	boundary	are	fully	restrained	( at	 ),	 (Align	the	equation	with	the	text)while	for	the	free	end	all	the	nodal	degrees	of	freedoms

are	unrestrained.	The	material	properties	correspond	to	that	designated	as	Composite	B	in	Table	1.

Beams	with	different	length-to-thickness	ratios	 (with	 ),	from	thick	to	thin	beams,	are	analyzed	using	8	(eight)	Gram	Schmidt	(GS)	polynomials	for	each	kinematic	variable.	To	this	study,	firstly,	the

free	end	deflection	is	analyzed	and	the	following	dimensionless	variable	is	used:

where	

Fig.	4	shows	the	variation	of	the	dimensionless	free	end	deflection	against	 .	The	graph	shows	that	the	solution	converges	as	the	length-to-thickness	ratio	of	the	beam	increases,	tending	towards	a	horizontal

asymptote	 corresponding	 to	 the	 thin	 beam	 deflection	 with	 equivalent	 material	 properties.	 It	 is	 clear	 that	 the	 proposed	 PRZ	 element	 is	 free	 of	 shear	 locking	 and	 from	 the	 solution	 tends	 stably	 to	 the

corresponding	solution	for	thin	beams.

Second,	to	verify	that	the	PRZ	element	is	free	from	locking	shear,	transverse	shear	stresses	are	determined	both	from	the	constitutive	relations	(Eq.	(33))	as	well	as	from	the	equilibrium	equation	at	the	post-

processing	level	i.e.,

The	determination	is	made	for	a	thick	beam	( )	and	for	a	thin	beam	( ),	taking	two	different	sections	along	the	beam.	Figs.	5	and	6	show	the	thickness	distribution	of	shear	stresses	 in	sections

located	 at	 distances	 and	 from	 the	 clamped	 end.	 The	 transverse	 shear	 stresses	 computed	 from	 the	 constitutive	 relations	 are	 labeled	 as	 “Present-const”,	while	 the	 shear	 stresses	 computed	 from	 the

equilibrium	equations	are	labeled	as	“Present-equil”.	For	comparison	purpose	two	 profiles	obtained	by	Oñate	et	al.	[42]	have	been	included	in	the	figures.	One	of	these	results	were	obtained	using	a	mesh	of	27,000

four-noded	plane	stress	rectangles	(labeled	as	“PS”)	and	the	other	were	obtained	with	100	linear	two-noded	beam	elements	and	reduced	integration	proposed	by	the	mentioned	authors	(labeled	as	“RI”).

An	examination	of	the	numerical	results	presented	in	these	figures	shows	that	the	hierarchical	finite	element	developed	with	equal	interpolation	of	all	generalized	displacements	does	not	experience	shear

locking.	 The	 element	 behaves	 uniformly	 well	 for	 thin	 and	 thick	 beams.	 The	 finite	 element	 results	 are	 in	 excellent	 agreement	 with	 those	 reported	 in	 Ref.	 [42]	 where	 reduced	 integration	 has	 been	 used.	 The

displacements	converge	faster	than	stresses,	which	is	expected	because	the	rate	of	convergence	of	gradients	of	the	solution	is	one	order	less	than	the	rate	of	convergence	of	the	solution.

For	very	thin	beams,	very	good	agreement	is	found	between	the	thin-	theory	values	and	those	from	RZT	beam	theory	employing	PRZ	elements,	showing	that	the	proposed	element	is	not	prone	to	shear	locking.

6	Convergence	analysis
Recall	 that	the	advantages	of	 the	p-version	of	FEM	are	not	 limited	to	 the	greater	convergence	rate.	 In	 fact,	with	h	methods,	 the	accuracy	of	 the	solution	 is	determined	by	executing	several	analyses	with

different	meshes,	an	expensive	and	time-consuming	process,	both	because	of	the	computational	cost	and	because	of	the	operator	time	required	to	define	the	different	models.	In	p-convergent	approximations,	 the

number	of	finite	elements	is	determined	by	the	geometry	and	is	small.	Moreover,	to	verify	the	results,	the	order	of	the	approximation	can	be	selectively	increased.	This	operation	is	carried	out	very	efficiently	because

it	is	not	necessary	to	generate	a	new	mesh	and	because	the	new	linear	stiffness	matrices	contain	the	preceding	ones	[55].

For	the	convergence	study	once	again	the	cantilever	beam	subjected	to	a	unit	load	at	the	free	end	is	analyzed	(Fig.	3a).	Displacements	and	stresses	at	different	points	of	symmetric	(Composite	B,	Table	1)	and

arbitrarily	laminated	(Composite	A	and	C,	Table	1)	beams	are	obtained.	For	both	materials,	length-to-thickness	ratios,	 ,	are	considered.	For	the	different	combinations	of	length-to-thickness	ratios	and	material

properties,	convergence	studies	are	performed	by	varying	the	amount	of	GS	orthogonal	polynomials	of	the	approximation	functions	for	the	four	kinematic	variables,	from	1	to	10.

In	Tables	2–5	the	convergence	is	quantified	through	the	relative	error	given	by	the	following	expression

where	 and	y	 are	the	numerical	values	of	the	different	magnitudes	obtained	employing	10	GS	polynomials	and	 ( )	GS	polynomials,	respectively.

The	analysis	of	the	results	showed	in	Tables	2–5	and	Fig.	7	demonstrates	that	the	numerical	solutions	are	convergent	for	transverse	displacement	 ,	amplitude	of	zigzag	function	 and	also	for	normal	( )

and	transverse	shear	( )	stresses	in	which	the	derivatives	of	the	displacement	field	components	are	involved.	As	expected,	convergence	is	slower	in	the	case	of	Composite	C	(more	heterogeneous	material)	than	for

composite	B.	For	8	GS	enrichment	polynomials	errors	for	all	considered	magnitudes	are	less	than	0.5%	for	composites	A,	B	and	C,	the	only	exception	is	the	value	of	the	normal	stress	 for	composite	C,	in	this	case

the	error	is	less	than	1.8%.	For	these	reasons,	the	calculations	using	eight	GS	enrichment	polynomials	for	each	kinematic	variable,	is	considered	sufficient	to	obtain	good	accuracy.

7	Validation	and	numerical	examples
In	this	section	different	problems	of	laminated	beams	are	solved	to	show	the	accuracy	and	applicability	of	the	present	FE	hierarchical	model	under	static	loading.	In	all	the	examples	presented,	both	in	this

section	and	 in	the	next,	 the	beams	are	modeled	with	a	single	 finite	element	with	two	end	nodes,	coincident	with	the	ends	of	 the	analyzed	beams.	The	 internal	or	hierarchical	nodes	depend	on	the	number	of	GS

polynomials	used	in	each	case	and	are	obtained	automatically	(see	Eqs.	(39)–(43)).

7.1	Symmetric	and	antisymmetric	cross-ply	laminated	beams
In	 this	subsection	results	obtained	 for	symmetric	 (0°/90°/0°)	and	antisymmetric	(0°/90°)	cross-ply	 laminated	beams	constituted	by	orthotropic	material	are	presented.	All	 layers	 in	 the	 laminates	have	 the	same	 thickness	 (

),	and	their	material	properties	are: ,	 ,	 ,	 ,	 .where	subscripts	1	and	2	 refer,	 respectively,	 to	 the	 fiber	direction	and	 to	 the

normal	direction.

The	symmetric	and	antisymmetric	beams	are	simply	supported	and	they	are	subjected	to	a	sinusoidal	load	 ,	as	shown	in	Fig.	3b.	For	these	support	conditions	only	three	degrees	of	freedoms	are	restrained:

)	and	transverse	shear	at	 stresses	for	0°/90°	antisymmetric	laminated	beams	are	presented	in	Table	6;	and	mid-span	deflections	and	the	normal	(at	 )	and	transverse	shear	at	 stresses	for

0°/90°/0°	symmetric	laminated	beams	are	depicted	in	Table	7.	Results	in	Tables	6	and	7	are	compared	with	the	3D	elasticity	solution	by	Pagano	[46]	and	with	those	published	by	Vidal	and	Polit	 [40].	Even	though	the	3D	elasticity

solution	by	Pagano	was	developed	for	cylindrical	bending	of	an	infinitely	wide	plate,	the	solution	is	equally	applicable	to	beams	under	plane	strain.	These	tables	prove	again	the	good	performance	of	the	PRZ	p-FEM	model	for	transverse

deflections,	and	for	normal	and	transverse	stresses	 in	both	cases,	symmetric	and	antisymmetric	cross-ply	 laminates.	Results	are	 in	good	agreement	with	respect	 to	 the	reference	solutions	and	 it	 is	seen	from	these	tables	that	 the

element	performs	quite	well	for	thick	beams	as	well	as	thin	beams,	as	has	been	previously	remarked	(Section	5).

7.2	Three	layered	thick	cantilever	beam	under	end	point	load,	with	non-symmetric	material	properties
Three-layered	thick	cantilever	beam	(Fig.	3a),	with	mid	plane	non-symmetric	material	properties	(Composite	C),	is	considered	in	this	subsection.	In	this	sandwich	laminate	the	core	is	eight	times	thicker	than	the	face	sheets	and

is	three	orders	of	magnitude	more	compliant	than	the	bottom	face	sheet.	Figs.	5–10	show	different	mechanical	responses	of	this	three-layered	thick	cantilever	beam	obtained	applying	PRZ	present	approach.	Also,	these	figures	include

plane	stress	results	reported	in	[42],	where	legend	caption	PS	denotes	these	reference	solutions	obtained	with	meshes	of	27,000	four-noded	plane	stress	quadrilaterals.

Fig.	8	shows	the	transverse	deflection	along	the	beam	length.	Fig.	9	shows	the	distribution	of	the	axial	displacements	at	the	upper	(Fig.	9a)	and	lower	(Fig.	9b)	surfaces	of	layer	3	(top	layer)	along	the	beam	length.	Fig.	10

shows	the	thickness	distribution	for	the	axial	displacement	at	sections	located	at	distances	 (Fig.	10a)	and	 (Fig.	10b)	from	the	clamped	end.	All	displacements	along	 axis,	both	transverse	and	axial,	and	in	the	last	case	also

along	the	thickness,	obtained	using	8	GS	enrichment	functions	for	each	kinematic	variable,	are	in	very	good	agreement	with	the	plane	stress	reference	solution.	Figs.	11	and	12	show	the	thickness	distribution	for	the	axial	stress	 at

the	clamped	section	and	the	center	of	the	beam,	respectively.	PRZ	results	agree	very	well	with	those	of	the	reference	solution	for	both	sections,	namely	at	 and	 .	Fig.	13	shows	the	thickness	distribution	for	the	transverse

the	constitutive	relations	(“Present-const”	 in	Fig.	13);	however,	 the	distribution	of	 the	shear	stress	can	be	computed	 from	the	equilibrium	equations	 (“Present-equil”	 in	Fig.	13)	 showing	an	excellent	agreement	with	 the	 reference

solution.

7.3	Three-layered	simple	supported	thick	beam	under	uniform	load
The	next	example	analyzes	the	behavior	of	a	three	layered	simply	supported	beam	(Fig.	3c)	under	a	uniformly	distributed	load	of	unit	value	( )	and	span	to	thickness	ratio	 .	In	this	case	the	degrees	of	freedoms	

and	 are	restrained	at	both	beam	ends	( ),	unlike	the	beam	shown	in	Fig.	3b.

The	material	properties	and	the	thickness	 for	 the	 three	 layers	are	given	 in	Table	1	 (Composite	D).	As	composite	C,	 this	material	has	a	non-symmetric	 layer	distribution	with	respect	 to	 the	beam	axis.	The	results	obtained

employing	the	proposed	PRZ	formulation	shown	in	Figs.	14–16	are	compared,	in	some	cases,	with	solutions	provided	by	Oñate	et	al.	[42].	As	in	Section	7.2	results	obtained	with	PRZ	element	have	been	labeled	as	“Present”	and,	for	the

case	that	transverse	shear	stresses	 they	are	computed	from	the	constitutive	equations	(Eq.	(1))	and	from	the	equilibrium	equation	(Eq.	(45))	and	labeled,	respectively,	as	“Present-const”	or	“Present-equil”.	At	the	same	time	the

reference	values	are	labeled	as	“PS”	for	results	from	plane	stress	and	“RI”	for	results	using	two-noded	linear	beam	element	with	reduced	integration.

Fig.	14	shows	the	distribution	of	the	transverse	deflection	along	the	beam	length	obtained	with	PRZ	and	are	compared	with	RI	reference	values,	very	good	agreement	is	found.	Fig.	15	shows	the	thickness	distribution	of	the

normal	axial	stress	at	 and	at	the	mid-section	( ).	The	accuracy	of	results	obtained	by	the	present	PRZ	approach,	employing	8	GS	orthogonal	polynomials,	is	noticeable	and	they	are	very	close	to	the	PS	solution.	Finally,

Fig.	16	shows	the	distribution	of	the	shear	stress	 along	the	thickness	for	a	section	located	next	to	the	left	support	( )	and	for	a	section	at	 .	In	this	last	case	the	average	transverse	shear	stress	for	each	layer

(obtained	from	the	constitutive	equation)	are	compared	with	RI	results,	showing	a	very	good	agreement.

8	Modeling	of	delamination	with	the	PRZ	element
The	analysis	and	numerical	modeling	of	damage	and	failure	in	laminated	beams	is	complex	task.	One	of	the	most	important	failure	mechanisms	in	these	kinds	of	structures	is	delamination.	For	instance	Di

Sciuva	and	Gherlone	[63]	used	Hermitian	zigzag	theory	and	sub-laminate	approach	and	analyzed	damage	interface	increasing	the	number	of	variables.	Oñate	et	al.	[42]	shows	that	the	two-noded	element	LRZ	element

developed	by	them	can	reproduce	the	delamination	effects	in	laminated	beams	without	introducing	additional	kinematic	variables.	This	section	proves	that	the	PRZ	element	has	the	same	property.	As	is	it	well	known,

delamination	is	produced	when	the	mechanical	properties	of	the	interface	layer	are	drastically	reduced	to	almost	a	zero	value	in	comparison	with	those	of	the	adjacent	layer	[64,65].	This	delamination	model	has	been

applied	by	Oñate	et	al.	[42]	to	test	the	performance	of	their	LRZ	into	this	class	of	study.	Now	the	mentioned	model	is	applied	to	show	the	capacity	of	this	new	PRZ	hierarchical	element	to	consider	the	loss	of	overall

rigidity	of	the	beam	due	to	delamination,	leading	to	an	increase	in	displacement	field	components.

For	this	analysis	a	simply	supported	beam	subjected	to	a	sinusoidal	distributed	load,	as	shown	in	Fig.	3b,	is	adopted.	The	reasons	for	such	election	are	the	possibility	of	comparing	with	results	obtained	by

programing	 the	Pagano	3D	 solution	 [46],	which	 can	be	 certainly	 determined	 in	 this	 case.	 The	 thick	 laminated	beam	 is	made	 of	 two	 layers,	with	 length-to-thickness	 ratio	 .	 The	 remaining	 geometrical	 and

mechanical	properties	are	given	 in	Table	8.	Delamination	between	 the	 two	 layers	 (bottom	and	 top	 layers)	 is	 taken	 into	account	by	 introducing	a	very	 thin	 interface	 layer	 (layer	2	 in	Table	8)	with	 identical	 initial

properties	to	the	top	layer.	Next,	the	transverse	shear	modulus	of	the	interface	layer	(G2)	is	progressively	reduced	from	Model	1	to	Model	12	as	shown	in	Table	9.

Fig.	 17	 shows	 the	mid	 span	 deflection	 of	 the	 laminated	 beam	 for	Models	 1	 to	 12,	 i.e.	 as	 a	 function	 of	 the	 shear	 transverse	modulus	 of	 the	 interface,	 obtained	with	 the	 present	 PRZ	 element	 and	 10	GS

enrichment	polynomials.	In	the	same	figure	results	obtained	applying	the	3D	Pagano	solution	have	been	included.	Same	interesting	features	are	highlighted;	first	the	mid-span	deflection	does	not	significantly	change

for	models	1–5	and	them	for	models	8–11	and	second,	as	a	logical	conclusion,	the	main	rigidity	global	beam	changes	occurs	when	the	shear	transverse	modulus	G2	varies	between	8.76E−001	MPa	and	8.76E−004	MPa.

Results	are	 in	good	agreement	with	 those	computed	 from	 the	3D	Pagano	 solution.	The	differences	are	 less	 than	6%,	and	 it	 should	be	noted	 that	 the	3D	deflection,	 for	 comparison	purpose,	was	obtained	as	 the

weighted	deflection	in	the	thickness	beam	at	 .

stresses	 at	 the	 interface	 layer	 due	 to	 delamination	 is	well	 captured	by	 the	 PRZ	 element.	 Theses	 stresses	 at	 the	 interface	 layer	 remains	 stationary	 after	 a	 reduction	 of	 the	material	 properties	 of	 six	 orders	 of

magnitude.	It	is	important	to	note	the	excellent	concordance	with	the	3D	solution	that	has	been	obtained	applying	the	Pagano	solution	[46].

stresses	 have	 been	 obtained	 using	 the	 present	 PRZ	 element	 by	 integrating	 the	 equilibrium	 equation.	 This	 Figure	 also	 includes	 the	 corresponding	 shear	 stresses	 obtained	 by	 applying	 Pagano’s	 analytical	 3D

formulation.	Note	again	the	noticeable	agreement	between	the	two	solutions.	Once	again	the	accuracy	of	PRZ	element	to	capture	the	delamination	effects	is	demonstrated.

9	Conclusions
A	hierarchical	beam	finite	element	based	on	the	p-version	of	FEM,	using	the	kinematics	of	the	Tessler’s	refined	zigzag	theory,	for	the	analysis	of	laminated	composite	beams,	has	been	developed.	Recall	that	the

advantages	of	the	p-version	are	not	limited	to	the	greater	convergence	rate.	In	fact,	with	h	methods,	the	accuracy	of	the	solution	is	determined	by	executing	several	analyses	with	different	meshes,	an	expensive	and

time-consuming	process,	both	because	of	the	computational	cost	and	because	of	the	operator	time	required	to	define	the	different	models,	including	de	meshing	process.	In	p-convergent	approximations,	the	number

of	finite	elements	is	determined	by	the	geometry	and	is	small.	Specifically,	all	the	examples	presented	in	this	work	require	a	single	hierarchical	finite	element	for	the	whole	beam	to	obtain	the	mechanical	responses,

which	are	very	accurate.	Moreover,	to	verify	the	results,	the	order	of	the	approximation	(hierarchical	modes)	can	be	selectively	increased.	This	operation	is	carried	out	very	efficiently	because	it	is	not	necessary	to

generate	a	new	mesh	and	because	the	new	linear	stiffness	matrix	contains	the	preceding	one.	The	convergence	study	has	demonstrated	that	the	element	proposed	requires	a	moderate	number	of	degrees	of	freedom

for	a	very	good	accuracy.	Moreover,	it	can	be	applied	to	study	thick	and	thin	beams	because	no	shear	locking	effects	were	found.	Recall	that	this	element	not	only	improves	the	convergence	and	avoids	the	shear

locking,	but	also	requires	a	 few	hierarchical	Gram-Schmidt	polynomials	 for	 the	same	 level	of	accuracy.	As	a	 further	matter,	 to	verify	 the	results,	 the	order	of	 the	approximation	can	be	selectively	 increased.	This

operation	is	carried	out	very	efficiently	because	it	is	not	necessary	to	generate	a	new	mesh	and	because	the	new	linear	stiffness	matrix	contains	the	preceding	ones.	The	possibility	of	this	new	element	to	consider

delamination	effects	has	been	clearly	demonstrated.	On	the	other	side,	the	hierarchical	finite	element	proposed	allows	to	take	into	account	all	coupling	effects	in	an	efficient	and	unified	procedure.	For	this	reason,	the

developed	PRZ	element	can	be	applied	to	the	analysis	of	laminated	beam	with	functionally	graded	materials	or	damage	profile	at	laminar	levels,	and	it	is	currently	studied	by	the	authors.
