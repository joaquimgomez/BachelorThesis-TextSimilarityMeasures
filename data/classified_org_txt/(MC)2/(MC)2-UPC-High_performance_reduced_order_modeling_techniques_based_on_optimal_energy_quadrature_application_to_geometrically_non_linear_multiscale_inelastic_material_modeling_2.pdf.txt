Abstract

A High-Performance Reduced-Order Model (HPROM) technique, previously presented by the authors
in the context of hierarchical multiscale models for non linear-materials undergoing infinitesimal strains,
is generalized to deal with large deformation elasto-plastic problems.

The proposed HPROM technique uses a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) procedure to build
a reduced basis of the primary kinematical variable of the micro-scale problem, defined in terms of
the micro-deformation gradient fluctuations. Then a Galerkin-projection, onto this reduced basis, is
utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the micro-force balance equation, the stress homogenization
equation and the effective macro-constitutive tangent tensor equation. Finally, a reduced goal-oriented
quadrature rule is introduced to compute the non-affine terms of these equations.

Main importance in this paper is given to the numerical assessment of the developed HPROM technique.
The numerical experiments are performed on a micro-cell simulating a randomly distributed set of
elastic inclusions embedded into an elasto-plastic matrix. This micro-structure is representative of a
typical ductile metallic alloy. The HPROM technique applied to this type of problem displays high
computational speed-ups, increasing with the complexity of the finite element model.

From these results, we conclude that the proposed HPROM technique is an effective computational tool
for modeling, with very large speed-ups and acceptable accuracy levels with respect to the high-fidelity
case, the multiscale behavior of heterogeneous materials subjected to large deformations involving two
well-separated scales of length.

1. Introduction

Several reasons can be invoked in favor of adopting a two-scale hierarchical computational material ho-
mogenization technique, such as shown in [1] and [2], as a tool of analysis. This conceptual framework,
frequently called FE2 approach by some authors ([3]), is becoming a widely utilized tool in the Com-
putational Mechanics community, mainly to evaluate the effective properties of heterogeneous materials
([4]).

However, this technique still has some issues which limits its application to industrial problems. In fact,
one of the main characteristic features of this approach remarked in the present context, refers to the
required high computational cost to process the information computed at the micro-scale level. This
information is obtained after solving a huge number of almost identical micro-mechanical problems,
but notably, that information is then filtered out and only a small quantity of data is up-scaled at the
macro-scale problem. An even more remarkable feature is that the space of data, driving these huge

2



number of micro-mechanical problems, can be parametrized in a space of only four dimensions for plane
problems or six dimensions for 3D problems.

From this perspective, it seems reasonable to wonder if a model reduction technique, providing ap-
proximated solutions, could give a favorable trade-off between computational cost and fidelity loss of
results. We think that the answer to this question is a clear “yes”, and furthermore, we also think that
techniques based on dimensionality reduction and hyper-reduction of the small scale problem become a
good option to get this target, such as explored by [5] and [6].

Following this goal, the purpose of this work is to generalize a version of the reduced-order model
based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and a reduced goal-oriented integration rule,
previously presented by the authors in [7], aiming at a different range of applications. In the present
work, we extend the HPROM technique for modeling non-linear geometrical behavior in multi-scale
modeling via computational homogenization. Typically, large deformation problems subjected to small
rotation regimes, observed in multi-scale homogenization problems arising in a wide range of material
modeling applications.

The so-developed model is then assessed by determining the effective properties of a rather standard
metallic composite which characterization, by means of a phenomenological mono-scale material model,
has shown to be difficult.

Similar to the previous contribution of the authors, see [6], the development of the micro-scale HPROM
technique in this paper involves two stages. The off-line stage is devoted to computing, through an
adequate training of the cell representing the material micro-structure, a series of snapshots of the orig-
inal High-Fidelity Finite Element Model (HFFEM) solutions. With these snapshots, a low-dimensional
space of the primary kinematical variable is built using a POD strategy. A posterior Galerkin projection
of the micro-force balance equations onto this space provides the Reduced Order Model (ROM). How-
ever, as noted elsewhere (see [5], [8]), the integral of the non-linear micro-force balance equation terms,
resulting from this projection, penalize the attainment of high computational speed-ups constituting a
computational bottleneck. Therefore, to mitigate this effect, a hyper-reduced model is next developed;
the name ”hyper-reduced is taken from [5]. In the present paper, the hyper-reduction is attained by
introducing a ”Reduced Optimal Quadrature (ROQ) rule, which integrates accurately the POD modes
of the elastic internal energy obtained from the solution snapshots above mentioned. The ROQ rule has
been taken from [7] and preserves the Lagrangian structure of the mechanical problem, see [9].

The considered homogenization procedure is only valid for simulating the stable regime of the homoge-
nized material. Such as commented in [10] and [11], in order to preserve the consistency of the problem
mathematical formulation after losing the macro-stability, a characteristic length has to be extracted
from the micro-cell model and used to regularize the homogenized model at the macroscale. Since this
paper is focused on studying the performance of the proposed HPROM technique in the geometrically
nonlinear regime, this issue is not addressed here, and therefore, the HPROM numerical assessments
are restricted to the range where the macro-scale remain stable.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief description of the multi-scale technique
addressed to simulate heterogeneous materials. This topic is the object of study in this paper. In partic-
ular, sub-Section 2.4 describes several micro-cell Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) formulations
which are posteriorly utilized for implementing the ROM and ROQ procedures.

Section 3 summarizes the foundation and development of the HPROM technique, constituted by the

3



ROM and ROQ procedures, for computing the micro-cell solutions. The ROM procedure is briefly
presented in sub-Section 3.1, while the ROQ procedure in sub-Section 3.2. Section 4 describes the
sampling program for testing the micro-cell HFFEM.

The numerical assessment of the HPROM technique is addressed in Section 5. We study the truncation
and sampling errors associated with the micro-cell training program. Also, through a full multiescale
test we evaluate the attained computation time speed-ups versus the errors introduced by the HPROM
technique. The comparison of these results with that obtained using a HFFEM strategy gives the
adequate support in favor of the HPROM technique. In the final part of the paper, we present the
conclusions of this study.

2. A Two-scale Model Under Finite Strain Regimes

The computational multiscale modeling of heterogeneous material computes the stress-strain relationship
by solving an IBVP formulated at the length scale at which the material micro-structure can be identified.
Then, two length scales naturally arise in the problem: the macro-scale, of similar order to the structural
size h, and the micro-scale, of similar order to the material heterogeneity size hµ, see Figure 1. Both
length scales are assumed to be well-separated.

At the micro-scale, the material is modeled utilizing a micro-cell domain Bµ, satisfying the condition of
being a Representative Volume Element (RVE). The IBVP at the macro-scale is formulated in B.

Two different material coordinate systems are introduced in the formulation. Material points at the
macro-scale are identified with the vector X and material points at the micro-scale with the vector
Y . While displacements, deformation gradients and (first Piola-Kirchhoff) stresses at the macro-scale
are denoted UM ,FM and PM , respectively. The similar objects at the micro-scale are denoted with
symbols Uµ, F µ and P µ, respectively.

2.1. Admissible Kinematics at the RVE

The two-scale model formulation in this Section follows a similar description of that presented in [12]
and [13]. Let us consider the micro-scale domain Bµ, sketched in Fig. 1, of size hµ and boundary Γµ,

4



with unit normal vector denoted by Nµ. The microscopic displacement field, denoted in the material
description Uµ, can be expressed as the addition of three terms:

Uµ(Y , t;X) = U
M (X, t) + [FM (X, t)− I]Y + Ũµ(Y , t) (1)

where UM is the macro-scale displacement, the second term is a displacement field which gradient is
∇Y (•) = FM (X, t)−I = ∇XUM (X, t) and Ũµ is a micro-displacement field fluctuation which becomes
the primary unknown variable in the governing equations for the RVE conventional IBVP formulated
as PROBLEM I (summarized in next sub-Sections). According to Eq. (1), the micro-deformation
gradient can be expressed as the addition of two terms:

F µ(Y , t;X) ≡ I +∇Y Uµ = FM +∇Y Ũµ := FM + F̃ µ . (2)

The first term, FM , is the macroscopic (homogenized) deformation gradient, homogeneously injected in
Bµ, while F̃ µ = ∇Y Ũµ is the fluctuating component. This fluctuating component becomes the primary
kinematical variable of the IBVP formulated as PROBLEM I-R in next sub-Sections.

Additionally, it is assumed that the homogenized deformation gradient, FM , has to be equivalent to
the volume average of the microscopic deformation gradient field, F µ, over the RVE:

FM (X, t) ≡
1

Vµ

∫
Bµ
F µ(Y , t;X) dBµ , (3)

where Vµ is the volume of the micro-cell. After introducing Eq. (2) and the Gauss theorem in the
identity (3), it results ∫

Bµ
F̃ µ dBµ =

∫
Bµ
∇Y Ũµ dBµ =

∫
Γµ

Ũµ ⊗Nµ dΓ = 0 . (4)

This equation induces a natural constraint on the possible RVE fluctuation fields of displacements and
deformation gradients. Then, fields Ũµ and F̃ µ only satisfying Eq. (4) are considered as kinemat-
ically admissible fields. Therefore, the minimally constrained set of kinematically admissible micro-
displacements fluctuations UUµ is defined as:

UUµ ≡

{
Ũµ |

∫
Bµ
∇Y Ũµ dBµ =

∫
Γµ

Ũµ ⊗ n dΓ = 0

}
(5)

2.2. Hill-Mandel Principle: Micro-scale Equilibrium Problem and Stress Homogenization

The scale bridging equations for stresses can be derived by assuming the variational format of the
commonly used Hill-Mandel Principle which establishes that the macroscopic virtual stress power PM :
δFM must be equal to the volume average of the micro-virtual stress power P µ : δF µ when the virtual

kinematical terms, δFM and δF µ, are connected through Eq. (2) and Eq. (4). Here, and in the

5



following, the symbol δ(•) means the difference between two arbitrary elements of the corresponding
functional space. This variational principle is mathematically expressed as:

PM : δFM =
1

Vµ

∫
Bµ
P µ : (δF

M +∇Y δŨµ) dBµ ,

∀δŨµ ∈ VUµ , ∀δF
M ∈ Rndim×ndim .

(6)

The admissible space of micro-displacement fluctuations VUµ is identical to UUµ (VUµ ≡ UUµ ), while
the space of admissible macro-deformation gradient is the full space of second order tensors denoted
Rndim×ndim (ndim is the space dimension).

As a consequence of Eq. (6), the following micro-scale equilibrium equation is obtained:∫
Bµ
P µ : ∇Y δŨµ dBµ = 0 ∀δŨµ ∈ VUµ , (7)

as well as the stress homogenization equation:

PM (X, t) =
1

Vµ

∫
Bµ
P µ(Y , t;X) dBµ . (8)

Eq. (7) provides a variational equation for the micro-scale, while Eq. (7) gives the scale bridging
equation between micro and macro-stresses.

2.3. Micro-scale Constitutive Equations

The constitutive equation relating P µ, the micro-scale deformation gradient, F µ, and the set of internal
variables, αµ, at the micro-scale is here generically written as the stress-strain relationship

P µ = P̂ µ(F µ, αµ) , (9)

supplemented with the evolution equation of the internal variables

α̇µ = g(F µ, Ḟ µ, αµ) . (10)

In particular, when the micro-components of the heterogeneous material follow an elasto-plastic constitu-
tive law, the conventional multiplicative decomposition of the micro-deformation gradient F µ = F

e
µF

p
µ

is assumed, where F eµ and F
p
µ are the elastic and plastic deformation gradients, respectively. Also, an

additive decomposition of the micro-free energy, ϕµ, into elastic, ϕ
e
µ, and plastic, ϕ

p
µ, energy terms

ϕµ(F µ,F
p
µ, αµ) = ϕ

e
µ(F µ,F

p

is assumed.

In this case, the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress in the reference configuration, see [14], is obtained as

P̂ µ =
∂ϕeµ
∂F µ

. (12)

6



Also, by considering the tangent constitutive tensor at the micro-scale Aµ = ∂P̂ µ/∂F µ, the tensor of
effective moduli A is computed as

A(X, t) =
∂PM

∂FM
=

1

Vµ

∫
Bµ

Aµ(Y , t) (I + Lµ(X,Y , t)) dBµ , (13)

where I is the fourth order identity tensor and Lµ = ∂(∇Y Ũµ)/∂FM is the localization tensor that can
be obtained using Eq. (7). A complete description of the resulting homogenized macroscopic model can
be found in [12].

2.4. Micro-scale Initial Boundary Value Problem Formulations

Three alternative and equivalent micro-scale IBVP formulations are described in this Section. The
first one is a conventional formulation, widely utilized in the computational homogenization community
resulting from the set of equations (5), (7) and the evolution equations for the internal variables of the
component constitutive equations, at the micro-scale.

The second formulation is introduced with the objective of reducing the dimension of the space repre-
senting the field F µ.

The third formulation is utilized to introduce the hyper-reduced model (ROQ rule).

2.4.1. Conventional Formulation

The set of Eqs. (5)–(7) and the constitutive Eqs. (9)–(10) defines a Variational Initial Boundary Value
Problem (VIBVP) at the RVE. This problem is identified as PROBLEM I and is summarized in the
following Box:

PROBLEM I: (RVE variational displacement fluctuation-based problem)
Given the macro-scale deformation gradient, F , the space of displacement fluctuations, UUµ , and
the space of virtual kinematically admissible displacement fluctuations VUµ , with:

UUµ = V
U
µ :=

{
Ũµ |

∫
Bµ
∇Y Ũµ dBµ =

∫
Γµ

Ũµ ⊗Nµ dΓ = 0

}
(14)

find Ũµ ∈ UUµ such that:∫
Bµ
P̂ µ(F µ, αµ) : ∇Y δŨµ dBµ = 0 ; ∀δŨµ ∈ VUµ ; (15)

α̇µ = g(F µ, Ḟ µ, αµ) (16)

7



2.4.2. Formulation in Deformation Gradient Fluctuations

As it will be shown later, it is convenient to rephrase PROBLEM I taking the micro-deformation
gradient fluctuation, F̃ µ, as a primal variable instead of Ũµ. Let us consider the space Fµ of micro-
deformation gradient functions that are kinematically compatible. This space is characterized by (see
[15]):

Fµ :=
{
F̃ µ ∈ Rndim×ndim | ∇ ∧ F̃ µ = 0

}
(17)

Notice that the compatibility equation in (17)1 is linear and homogeneous, which is a crucial fact to
reduce the dimension of the space approaching the deformation gradient fluctuation field, F̃ µ, through
a POD technique.

Taking into account Eq. (2) and constraint (4), PROBLEM I can be rephrased as:

PROBLEM I-R: (RVE rephrased variational deformation-gradient-based problem in terms of
F̃ µ)

Given the macro-scale deformation gradient, FM , and the space:

UFµ = V
F
µ :=

{
F̃ µ | F̃ µ ∈ Fµ and

∫
Bµ
F̃ µ dBµ = 0

}
(18)

find F µ = F
M + F̃ µ, with F̃ µ ∈ UFµ , such that:∫

Bµ
P̂ µ(F µ, αµ) : δF̃ µ dBµ = 0 ; ∀δF̃ µ ∈ VFµ ; (19)

α̇µ = g(F µ, Ḟ µ, αµ) (20)

It can be proved that PROBLEM I-R is equivalent to PROBLEM I , where, in the later, the
dependent variables (micro-scale First Piola-Kirchhoff stress P µ) are now given in terms of the micro-

deformation gradient fluctuations, F̃ µ. The displacement fluctuations field, Ũµ, could be recovered
through a displacement-recovery procedure based on an additional integration at the reference config-
uration of the equation F̃ µ = ∇Y Ũµ. A consistent variational procedure for reaching this objective is
provided in the reference [7].

2.4.3. Formulation Based on the Elastic Free Energy

After considering the stress-strain relationship, Eq. (12), the self-equilibrium of the micro-stresses can
be imposed as a stationary point of the potential elastic energy with frozen FM and internal variables
(i.e. the overall elastic energy over the micro-cell is stationary with arbitrary variations of F̃ µ

2), as

δF µ = δF̃ µ. Subindex [F

M , αµ] in Eq. (21) means that variables F
M and αµ are hold fixed when

imposing variations of F̃ µ.

The equilibrium equation (21) has to be considered jointly with the evolution equation (10) to describe
the complete IBVP. Then, the micro-scale mechanical problem can be re-formulated as shown in the
following Box.

Given the macro-scale deformation gradient, F , and the space UFµ , find F µ = F + F̃ µ, with
F̃ µ ∈ UFµ , such that:

3. Hyper Reduced-Order Model of the Micro-scale Problem

The proposed hyper-reduction strategy is based on the following sequential steps: initially, as described
in sub-Section 3.1, a set of reduced basis for spanning two micro-state variables, the deformation gradient
fluctuations and the elastic free energy, of the micro-cell problem are obtained through a POD procedure.

Then, the Reduced Order Model (ROM) is built by projecting the problem PROBLEM I-R onto the
low-dimensional space of deformation gradient fluctuations. This step is described in next sub-Section
3.1.1.

In a subsequent step, a Reduced-Order Quadrature (ROQ) rule is introduced. With this rule, a low
computational cost procedure for evaluating the volume integral in PROBLEM II , the homogenized
stress Eq. (8) and the effective constitutive tangent tensor Eq. (13), is attained. This step is described
in next sub-Section 3.2.

3.1. Projection of State Variables in Low-dimensional Spaces

To reduce the dimensionality of the kinematical variable F̃ µ, the original micro-cell HFFEM is used
to sample the corresponding solution space through several training trajectories. A number of solu-
tions, from these trajectories, are collected. Each sampled trajectory corresponds to a specific load-
ing/unloading macro-strain history FM (s) injected onto the microscale model. Here, the parameter
s ∈ [0, tmax] represents the RVE loading history until reaching the pseudo-time tmax.

Let us consider a given i-th solution gathered from a training trajectories. We identify the i-th column
vector χi

F̃µ
(with [χ]F̃µ ∈ R

4Npg ) as the collection and piling-up of the deformation gradient fluctuations

F̃ µ, of all the mesh quadrature points. Considering that the number of conventional quadrature Gauss
points in the HFFEM are Npg and the space dimension is ndim = 2 (i.e. 2D problems), then, the vector
χi

F̃µ
is given by

where supraindex k indicates the value at the corresponding k−th Gauss point. This vector represents
a snapshot of the HFFEM solutions.

The snapshot matrix of deformation gradient fluctuations is built with the collection of the the Nsnp
snapshot vectors:

[χ]F̃µ =

From the snapshot matrix [χ]F̃µ and using a POD procedure, we compute an orthonormal reduced

basis of nF modes: {Ψ} := {Ψ1, ...ΨnF } where each basis, or mode, is Ψj ∈ R4Npg . Then, the low-
dimensional space of F̃ µ is spanned by this basis as follows

3:

F̃ µ (Y , t) =

nF∑
j=1

Ψj (Y ) cj (t) = Ψ(Y )c(t) , (26)

where the coefficients c are the time-dependent parameters of the linear combination. In the last identity,
we have simplified the notation by introducing the matrix Ψ ∈ R(4Npg)×nF and the vector c ∈ RnF ,
collecting the set of basis vectors {Ψj} and parameters cj , respectively.

In the same way, and following a similar approach, snapshots of the elastic free energy, for all trajectories,
are also gathered in the vector

χiϕeµ =

3Here, we introduce an abuse of notation. The expression Ψj (Y ) ∈ R4 should be interpreted as the one-to-one
mapping from the vector Ψj ∈ R4Npg to Npg vectors Ψj (Y ) ∈ R4 where Y takes the Npg discrete values of the Gauss
point positions. This mapping is a redistribution of the components of Ψj .

10



Then, using a POD technique, a reduced orthonormal basis, {Φ}, of nϕ modes can be computed and
the elastic free energy field is spanned using this low-dimensional basis:

ϕeµ(F
e
µ(Y , t), t) =

nϕ∑
j=1

Φj(Y )fj(t) = Φ(Y )f(t) , (29)

where the vector f collects the time-dependent parameters of the elastic free energy linear combination.
In the last equation, we have also simplified the notation by introducing the matrix Φ ∈ RNpg×nϕ .

The success of constructing properly a POD bases for F̃ µ and ϕ
e
µ relies on gathering appropriate

snapshots from the loading/unloading history representing the full space of solutions of the micro-cell
HFFEM.

3.1.1. Reduced Order Model (ROM)

Utilizing the same projection defined by Eq. (26) to approach elements of the functional spaces UFµ and
VFµ , the BVP PROBLEM I-R can be re-formulated using a low-dimensional approach. In this case,
Eq. (19) is written as ∫

Bµ
P̂ µ(F

M + Ψc, αµ) : Ψ(Y )δc dBµ = 0 ; ∀δc ∈ RnF ; (30)

We recall that all the basis vectors in {Ψ} satisfy the condition of belonging to VFµ . Therefore, any
function spanned by Ψ also satisfies the same constraint4.

Eq. (30) jointly with the evolution equations of the internal variables (10) define the ROM variational
problem.

3.2. High-Performance Reduced Order Model (HPROM)

The following the ideas are taken from the so-called cubature methods, described in [16] and [8], we
propose a Reduced Optimal Quadrature (ROQ) rule to integrate the non-linear term arising in PROB-
LEM II .

The technique uses the low-dimensional expansion of the elastic free energy given by Eq. (29). Then, a
reduced quadrature rule, similar to that proposed in [16], is introduced satisfying the following condition
imposed on every mode Φj :∫

Bµ
Φj(Y ) dBµ ≈

∫ red
Bµ

Φj(Y ) dBµ =

(31)

4 Since Eq. (17) is homogeneous, linear combinations of basis fulfilling strain compatibility give rise to compatible
strains.

11



where zk are Nr specific quadrature points in Bµ. Particularly, these points zk are selected among the
Gauss integration points corresponding to the original high-order finite element mesh. The terms ωk
are weights satisfying

Nr∑
k=1

ωk = Vµ and ωk ≥ 0 (for k = 1, · · · , Nr) . (32)

Remark 1: a key issue to develop a feasible a ROQ scheme is to define an efficient and high performance
algorithm to select the appropriate quadrature points, among the original global set of Gauss points,
and to compute their corresponding weights. The algorithm we use in this work to attain this objective
has been taken from [16].

Using the reduced quadrature, we compute the integral of the elastic free energy as∫

Since the integration domain Bµ is the same on both integral in Eq. (33), and they differ only on

4. RVE Configuration and Sampling Program Description

4.1. RVE off-line Sampling Program

The driving force which activates the micro-cell mechanical problem is the macro-scale deformation
gradient FM that is injected from the macro-scale onto the micro-cell domain. It means that the
components of FM can be taken as parameters to define the micro-cell sampling program. Particularly
for 2D problems, FM has four independent components.

In accordance with this fact, we design the micro-cell sampling program by defining a network of points
in the R4 space. The coordinates of each point identify the four parameters, ∆F11, ∆F22, ∆F12 and
∆F21. Then, every RVE training trajectory is associated with one network point by defining the RVE
time-loading process through the deformation gradient:

FM (s) = I + s

[
∆F11 ∆F12
∆F21 ∆F22

]
; with s ∈ [0, tmax]. (38)

where s scales the load level and plays a similar role to a pseudo-time, or arc-length parameter, for the
particular designed trajectory.

The chosen network points, in this space of parameters, have coordinates taking three discrete values:
0, 0.5 and 1, and therefore they constitute a hypercube in R4. The set of points generated by this
combination is 34 = 81. However, from this set, we remove the points staying on the same segment
intersecting the origin because they define identical trajectories by re-scaling appropriately the parameter
s. For example, once the point with coordinates [1., 0, 0, 0] has been chosen, the point with coordinates
[0.5, 0, 0, 0] is removed from the list. Removing these points from the list of the trained trajectories, the
so-defined sampling program remains with 38 trajectories contributing to alleviate the involved off-line
computational effort.

Furthermore, from every trained trajectory, we collect 70 snapshots of deformation gradient fluctuations
χi

F̃µ
, and 70 snapshots of internal free energy χiϕµ in accordance with the following criterion, see also

Figure 2-b:

1) ten equidistant snapshots are taken during the elastic micro-cell regime of each trained trajectory
(all integration points of the micro-cell remain in the elastic regime s ≤ sI ).

2) sixty equidistant snapshots are taken during the inelastic micro-cell regime of each trained trajec-
tory (at least, one integration point of the micro-cell is in plastic regime s ≥ sI ).

5. Numerical Assessments of the HPROM Technique

A ferritic ductile iron is adopted as the material to be simulated in the present numerical assessments.
The micro-structure is represented by two components such as shown in Figure 3. A ferritic matrix with
graphite nodules having a random distribution and sizes with average value of the order of 50µm. This
micro-structure is similar to that reported by [17], see also [18],

We assume that the matrix and the nodules have a perfect contact which is not degraded with the
load increment. Graphite nodules are assumed hyperelastic in all cases. While the matrix should be

5.1. Micro-cell Model

The window utilized for defining the micro-cell model is shown in Fig. 3. It does not matter to recognize
if it constitutes an RVE. Here, instead, the attention is focused on testing three different finite element
meshes modeling this window. The three meshes are displayed in Fig. 4 and are additionally described

14



in Table 1. From the coarser to the finer meshes, they are denoted MI, MII and MIII, respectively. The
finite element type utilized in the simulations is the one described in [19]. Periodic boundary conditions
are imposed in the micro-cell finite element models such as described by [20].

In this context, the accuracy of the ROM model mainly depends on the number of modes nF defining
the basis {Ψ} of the micro-deformation gradient fluctuations field, see [16, 7]; while the accuracy of
the HPROM model also depends on the number of cubature points, Nr, adopted in the ROQ scheme.
However, in [7], it has been shown a direct correspondence between Nr and the number of energy modes

15



nϕ defining the basis {Φ}. In fact, it is: Nr = nϕ + 1. Thus, the accuracy of the HPROM results will
depend on both parameters, nF and nϕ.

In this section, a judicious analysis is performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the errors with respect to
the parameters nF , nϕ and Nr, in different scenarios. Two different kinds of test are presented:

(1) Consistency tests: the goal is to analyze the errors introduced by the reduced models at repro-
ducing trained trajectories used in the sampling program. The reference solutions are provided by
the HFFEM. This kind of errors can be classified as truncation errors and sampling errors.

(a) Truncation errors: the POD technique selects a small number of modes from the snapshot
matrices and neglects those associated with singular values smaller than a given threshold,
and therefore, the reduced basis cannot span exactly all snapshots. This induces a truncation
error which can be a-priori estimated with the singular value magnitudes of the neglected
modes.

(b) Sampling errors: a second source of error is associated with the snapshot sampling technique.
Only a few snapshots of each trained trajectory are taken to build the global snapshot matrices
χF̃µ and χϕµ . Therefore, the reduced basis cannot reproduce exactly the trained trajectory.
This sampling error is evaluated a-posteriori requiring an on-line computation.

(2) Accuracy tests: the goal is to analyze the reduced model errors to reproduce random load-
ing/unloading trajectories (different from the set of trained trajectories). Within the context of
the present work, these tests can be performed either by injecting a macro-deformation gradient,
different to the ones used in the sampling program, or alternatively, by solving a full multiscale
problem, where the macro-deformation gradient, acting on the micro-cell, is obtained from the
resolution of the macro-scale equilibrium problem.

In accordance with this classification of the ROM errors, we present the following numerical results in
three parts. The first two parts, sub-sections 5.2 and 5.3, are devoted to study the consistency of the
methodology, for both, hyperelastic (sub-section 5.2) and elastoplastic (sub-Sections 5.3) materials, with
the ROM and HPROM formulations. The third part, section 5.4, is devoted to studying the accuracy
error of the HPROM formulation simulating a full multiscale test.

5.2. Numerical Assessment of HPROM Techniques for Hyperelastic Materials

In this first case, a hyperelastic material is used with the MIII-1 model. Material properties are
presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

Three trajectories, namely A, B and C, have been taken from the sampling program to check the con-
sistency of the methodology. In accordance with Eq. (38), they are defined by the following parameters

Trajectory A : (∆F11,∆F12,∆F21,∆F22) = (0.5, 1, 0, 0) ;

Trajectory B : (∆F11,∆F12,∆F21,∆F22) = (0, 0.5, 1, 0) ;

Trajectory C : (∆F11,∆F12,∆F21,∆F22) = (1, 0.5, 1, 1) ;

and s ∈ [0 , 0.6] .

analysis, s = 0.6, obtained with the HFFEM. Notice the maximum values attained in this solution, as

5.2.1. Consistency Tests

a) Singular Value Spectrum

The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a snapshot matrix provides the spectrum of singular values
which are related to each orthonormal mode. This spectrum gives an a-priori estimation of the truncation
error of the removed modes when the reduced basis is chosen.

Fig. 6 presents the singular value spectrum of the snapshot matrices χF̃µ and χϕµ that have been
obtained with the above described sampling program. A similar decreasing tendency is observed for
both spectra.

In order to guarantee a proper development of the present methodology, it is recommended to exclude
from the reduced basis the modes associated with very low singular values.

b) A-priori ROM Errors

Once the the POD basis {Ψ} of the reduced space for the deformation gradient fluctuation has been
built, the a-priori error to retrieve a snapshot χi

can be assessed through

An identical a-priori truncation error, ErrorΦ, can be computed for the snapshot matrix χϕµ using the
energy reduced base {Φ}.

Both truncation errors, ErrorΨ and ErrorΦ, as functions of the number of modes defining the corre-
sponding basis have been computed for trained trajectories A, B and C. These errors are shown in Fig.
7. Notice that the error responses changes slightly with different trajectories and they are nearly zero
with a large enough number of modes.

The remarkable point that must be analyzed in plots of Fig. 7, corresponds to the rate at which this
error goes to zero. Indeed, very steep curves in the region with a low number of modes, identify an
optimal reduction procedure requiring a low quantity of modes to satisfactorily approach the solution
field.

criterion, with the MIII-1 model and simulating the sampled trajectories A, B and C. While, Fig. 8-b
shows the error attained by simulating an arbitrary non-trained trajectory. Convergence toward the
HFFEM solution is achieved when the number of deformation gradient modes (nF ) is increased.

In addition, it can be noticed that taking nF = 20, regardless of the trajectory reproduced with the
ROM model, the a-posteriori error is close to zero. So, this analysis is appropriated to check the quality
of the sampling program to explore the full space of deformation gradient fluctuations. Being also used
to define a lower bound in the number of modes for computing the online stage.

Fig. 9 plots the homogenized response (PM vs. FM ) provided by the ROM model, with an increasing
number of deformation gradient modes, nF , for trajectory B. From these results, it is checked that
both axial components of PROM match the homogenized solution of the HFFEM when the deformation
gradient modes in the corresponding POD basis is increased.

b) HPROM solutions for sampled trajectories

The plots in Fig. 10 display the homogenized First Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor components (P )11 and
(P )22 obtained with HPROM vs. the load level of the trained trajectory B. At the same time, these
results are compared with the HFFEM solution. The HPROM solutions are obtained with two number
of deformation gradient modes, nF = 5 and nF = 10, respectively, combined with a number of reduced
order quadrature points Nr.

gradient modes. In the same plots, the computational speed-up5, is also depicted. Noticed that for
very low values of Nr, the solution of the HPROM is unstable and noisy. However, by selecting a large
enough value of Nr, the error holds small and almost constant, indicating the existence of a minimum
amount of quadrature points, called the Optimal Quadrature Number (OQN). This threshold value is
considered an optimum number because a significant increase of quadrature points does not provide a
notably increase in the accuracy. Therefore, the OQN must be used in order to guarantee an optimal
performance of the HPROM model.

5.2.3. Design Strategy for Hyperelastic Materials

Performing the same procedure to that used for obtaining the results of Fig. 11, for a number of nF and
Nr, we can collect all results and build the abacus displayed in Fig. 12. The upper plot in this Figure
gives the ErrorP [%] vs. nF , while the lower plots display the OQN and speed-ups vs. nF . This abacus
is valid for model MIII-1.

Both plots in Fig. 12 can be used as an adequate tool for an a-piori design of the HPROM strategy
in the following sense: the methodology begins by selecting the admissible error (e.g. < 1.0%), then,
in accordance with the abacus, the amount of modes needed to obtain this error is nF = 12. Taking
this value of nF , and entering to the lower graph in Fig. 12, an optimal number of quadrature points
(OQN = 75) is obtained, with a corresponding speed-up of ∼ 2700.

The availability of such an abacus (a-priori constructed) for a specific RVE microstructure, allows the
user’s selection of the most appropriate HPROM strategy, by balancing the admissible error vs. the
desired speed-up, to guarantee its optimal performance in the on-line computational stage.

5.3. Numerical Assessment of HPROM Techniques for Elasto-plastic Materials

The following tests are performed by modeling the matrix of the composite in Fig. 3 with and elasto-
plastic constitutive model and the graphite nodules with an hyperelastic model. The elastic and plastic
free energy expressions for both material models are given by Eq. (A.1) and (A.6), in Appendix A,
while the corresponding parameters are described in Table 2.

Next, the uni-axial trajectory with macro-deformation gradient defined according to Eq. (38) and

(∆F11,∆F22,∆F12,∆F21) = (1, 0, 0, 0) (42)

is used to check the consistency of the methodology. With this trajectory, it can be reached a highly
non-uniform pattern of strain distribution without inducing loss of macro-stability.

Fig. 13 displays the color maps of the deformation gradient fluctuation components obtained with the
HFFEM. We analyze the capacity of the HPROM strategy for capturing this rather complex deformation
pattern observed in previous stages to the detection of macroscopic bifurcation.

5Speed-up are evaluated as the ratio between time required to compute the HFFEM solution and the time required to
compute the reduced model solution.

5.3.1. Singular Value Spectrum

The singular value spectra resulting from the SVD of the snapshot matrices χF̃µ and χϕµ are depicted
in Fig. 14. Comparing these spectra with those of Fig. 6, it can be concluded that, a larger amount
of modes are needed by the elasto-plastic model to decrease the truncation errors at a given order of
magnitude.

15. The plots in this Figure display the homogenized First Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor components
(PM )11 and (P

M )22 obtained with HPROM vs. the corresponding deformation gradient increase.
Several plots, with two different sets of deformation gradient modes: nF = 30 and nF = 40, show the
sensitivity of the homogenized stresses with the increase of Nr. Curves denoted HF are obtained with
the HFFEM.

As anticipated above, in contrast with the hyperelastic case, the elasto-plastic case needs a larger
amount of deformation gradient modes to accurately match the HFFEM solution. In consequence, a
larger number of reduced integration points must also be used to obtain an accurate response.

The plots in Fig. 16 display the error of the homogenized stress tensor evaluated with the HPROM
model by changing the number of quadrature points Nr. They have been obtained with nF = 40, 50
and 60 deformation gradient modes. In the same plots, the computational speed-up with respect to the
HF case is also depicted. Note that, by selecting a high enough value of Nr, the error holds small and
almost constant. Indicating, once again, the existence of an Optimal Quadrature Number (OQN).

In the same Fig. 16, it can be observed a residual error of the order of 2%, even for large values of
nF . This residual error is associated with a sampling error, which could be diminished by increasing
the number of snapshots taken from the uni-axial trajectory to compute the reduced bases.

strategy, with the trajectory defined by an uni-axial deformation gradient, using MIII-2 model (39970 finite elements).
Curves denoted HF have been obtained with the HFFEM.

5.3.3. Design Strategy

Fig. 17 shows the summary of results obtained with the HPROM strategy, using a wide range of defor-
mation gradient modes, with MIII-2 model. The Optimal Quadrature Number for all set of deformation
gradient modes is also depicted.

This Figure can also be used to obtain a HPROM design strategy for the elasto-plastic MIII model.
In this case, the strategy is similar to that described for hyperelastic materials in sub-section 5.2.3.
By assuming an acceptable maximum error, the upper plot in Fig. 17 gives the number of gradient
deformation fluctuation modes that, at least, should be utilized. Once the number of modes nF has
been defined, Fig. 17-b provides the number Nr which should, at least, used to obtain the corresponding
speed-up (dark green line). We recall that the number of quadrature points Nr is intimately associated
with the number of energy modes (nϕ = Nr − 1).

5.3.4. Speed-up Scalability

An issue of primary importance in developing a successful HPROM technique is related to the expected
performance trend, in terms of speed-up, when the HFFEM increases its complexity. The notion of
complexity refers to the problem size, here evaluated in term of d.o.f.’s, of the HFFEM.

We evaluate this issue for the present HPROM technique. To perform this analysis, we solve the
trajectory with a given macro-deformation gradient that corresponds to a uni-axial stretching (∆F =
[1, 0, 0, 0]), using the elasto-plastic material described in the previous subsections, with three finite
element meshes denoted MI, MII and MIII, respectively.

The optimal selection of nF and OQN , for the three models, have been carried out by using a similar
abacus to that of Fig. 17, and with the objective that the Errorp[%] does not exceed 2.5% for each
model.

time to compute one time step.

Remark: The linear log-log scalability character displayed in Fig. 18 can be justified from the following
facts:

1) for the same micro-cell morphology, with fine enough finite element meshes, the required modes
for approaching the corresponding deformation gradient fluctuations and energies tend to be the
same, independently of the mesh complexity;

2) therefore, the computational cost of the HPROM is going to be very similar “disregarding the
discretization level of the HFFEM mesh”;

3) in consequence, the HPROM speed-up grows with the HFFEM cost of the micro-cell analysis at
the same rate in terms of the complexity. Therefore, in terms of the complexity, “the speed-up
increase follows the same law as the HFFEM computational cost increase”.

5.4. Accuracy Test: Multiscale Test

Next, we present a numerical evaluation of a structural bar constituted by the same composite shown
in Fig. 3, using a two-scale approach.

The main objective of this section is to evaluate the HPROM methodology and compare its results with
the HFFEM, in terms of accuracy and speed-ups.

The bar is stretched along its axis. The geometry and boundary conditions of the simulated specimen
are depicted in Fig. 19. Plane strain assumption is adopted and the thickness is 0.001m.

28



The bar domain is split into two regions. 1) The multi-scale region with 190 finite elements at the
macro-scale. Full geometrical and material non-linearies are simulated at this region. The MII micro-
cell model, shown in Fig. 4, is used for simulating the micro-structure. 2) The remaining parts of the
metal bar are modeled with an elastic monoscale approach (using 96 finite elements). The elasticity
tensor in this region is obtained through an homogenization of the micro-structure elastic properties in
the central bar region.

5.4.1. HPROM Solutions

Figure 20 plots the macro-structural response in terms of force, F1, vs. displacements U1 imposed at the
end of the bar. The bar is stretched up to 17.5% (U1 = 0.035m). The plots compare the results obtained
with the HFFEM response and three HPROM simulations, assuming the same number of deformation
modes ( nF = 30) in the three simulations. The quantity of quadrature points Nr are depicted for each
plot.

In addition, in the same Figure 20, we show the relative errors of the computed structural response for
each HPROM solution. The relative errors have been computed as follows

error =

∫ U1=0.035
U1=0

‖(F1)HPROM − (F1)HF ‖
‖(F1)HF ‖

dU1 (43)

As can be observed, the relative errors do not exceed 2.5%. The Figure also displays the speed-up for
each HPROM solution, respect to the HFFEM computational time.

The speedup is estimated by evaluating the computational cost required to solve 10 global steps. The
HPROM solutions have been obtained using a single desktop computer i7 4770 3.5 GHz and 32Gb RAM.
While the full HFFEM solution was obtained in a computer cluster utilizing 96 cores. In this case, the
clock time has been 223866.sec.

In Figure 21, we show the iso-maps of the deformation gradient fluctuations that have been obtained with
the HFFEM and HPROM solution (using nF = 30 and Nr = 97 quadrature points). Three components

are compared, ∆F11, ∆F22, ∆F12 and ∆F21. These solutions correspond to the last simulated load
step. In the Figure, it can be seen the strain localization pattern, between voids, which will lead to the
macro-stability loss (necking) in subsequent time steps. In the same Figure, observe the distribution of
macro-cumulative plastic strains at the same time step.

Figure 22 compares the plots of detQ = det(N(ω) · A ·N(ω))6 for the HFFEM model and HPROM
solutions, respectively. The angle ω at the macro-scale defines the unit normal vector N at the reference
configuration for which, the localization tensor is computed. Note that the macro-scale strong-ellipticity
indicator is well-captured by the HPROM solution. This is an additional result proving that the effective
constitutive tensor A, of the HPROM model, approaches the effective one of the HFFEM solution.

6. Conclusions

In this work, the HPROM technique previously presented by the authors in [7], is extended to the case of
modeling heterogeneous materials within a multi-scale FE2 approach accounting for large elasto-plastic
strains (Kouznetsova).

Hyper-reduction is attained by utilizing a specific quadrature scheme based on the ROQ technique
applied to the elastic potential energy of the material. The micro-cell volume integrations of the non-
linear terms arising in conventional multiscale material modeling, i.e the micro-scale variational problem,
the homogenized stress equations and the homogenized constitutive tensor, are treated with a modified
“optimal reduced order quadrature” scheme.

The resulting methodology can be inserted into the general framework of the Lagrangian structure
preserving reduction method [9], here generalized to the case of deformable continua in a multiscale
modeling context. The essential behind the approach consists of resorting to the fundamental or primi-
tive statement of the problem expressed in terms of a material domain integral. An equivalent statement

is obtained by deriving a ROQ in this domain through optimization of the numerical integration rule
to minimize the computational cost and maximize the accuracy. Then, the corresponding variational
problem is obtained by differentiation with respect to the state variables of that optimized equivalent
statement, this constituting the basis for most of the computational cost reduction. This technique,
that was previously developed in the previous work by the authors [7] and applied to non-linear multi-
scale fracture problems undergoing infinitesimal strains [10], is here generalized to the case of non-linear
kinematics and non-linear material behavior, and is the main contribution of this work. This proves
that the proposed HPROM techniques can be efficiently applied either in non-linear kinematics as well
as in non-linear material mechanics under the same general principles.

The numerical assessment has been addressed through a number of examples of increasing complexity
(in terms of the number of involved algebraic operations), and the trade-off between HPROM fidelity
loss vs. computational speed-ups are remarkable.

Another notable issue is the scalability in terms of speed-ups versus HFFEM complexity. In fact, this
scalability is a manifestation that, for a given given micro-structure morphology and specific accuracy
(and a sufficient finite element representation of it), the HPROM representations for increasingly re-
fined Finite Element meshes given micro-structure morphology lay on similar linear spaces. In other
words, for a given RVE morphology the HPROM computational cost tends to be constant (for a given

HPROM complexity = nF × Nr), and mesh refinement of the HFFEM model does not translate into
relevant additional computational times for the resulting HPROM model.

These considerations set new insights, and open a variety of scenarios regarding to industrial applications
in material modeling at two length scales, which are currently under study by the authors. They may
contribute to mitigate one of the roadblocks influencing the so-called tyranny of scales ([21]) and making
material multi-scale modeling techniques evolve toward routinely computational tools.

Finally, although this study has been performed in simplified 2D problems, in the authors’ opinion,
similar conclusions can be also anticipated valid for 3D cases. This is left to be proven in a future work.

In this appendix, we summarize the constitutive equations for modeling the micro-cell components of
the ferritic ductile iron utilized in Section 5. The J2-plasticity model here adopted is similar to that
