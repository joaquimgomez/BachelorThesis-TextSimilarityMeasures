Abstract
In this work a finite element method (FEM) is proposed to solve the problem of estimating 
the added resistance of a ship in waves in the time domain and using unstructured meshes. 
Two different schemes are used to integrate the corresponding free surface kinematic and 
dynamic boundary conditions: the first one based on streamlines integration (SLI); and the 
second one based on the Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerking (SUPG) stabilization. The 
proposed numerical schemes have been validated in different test cases, including towing 
tank tests with monochromatic waves. The results obtained in this work show the suitability 
of the present method to estimate added resistance in waves in a computationally 
affordable manner.

1. Introduction
In order to get a good prediction of the total resistance of a ship 
in a seaway the added resistance in waves has to be taken into 
account. And although the added resistance in waves is a 
second order component, it may reach up to 40% of the total 
average resistance for some specific wave frequencies where 
wave radiation increases.

Despite of the importance of the added resistance in waves and 
its impact on the long term performance of a ship, there are not 
many works in the literature coping with this problem using 
computational methods. Some formulation have been derived 
by different authors as an extension of the mean drift force 
induced by waves in the presence of a water current (Maruo 
1957; Journée 1992). These approaches basically modify 
damping and added mass coefficients, as well as the mean drift 
forces, to account for the current effect. However, convective 
terms in the free surface boundary conditions are neglected, 
limiting this approach to low Froude numbers. A more 
sophisticated approach is to solve the three dimensional 
potential flow problem in the frequency domain using the 
boundary element method (BEM), and obtain the added 
resistance using Maruo’s approach thereafter (Maruo 1960; 
Maruo 1963; Liu at al. 2011). However, Maruo’s approach is still 
limited to low Froude numbers, since it does not account for the 
free surface convective terms either. Few works can be found 
trying to solve the added resistance in waves in the time domain 
considering the convective terms in the free surface boundary 
condition and using potential flow (Joncquez 2009; Seo et al. 
2013; Afshar 2014; Park et al. 2016). The latter approaches are 
based on the BEM, consider linearized convective terms, and 
are constrained to structured meshes.

Non-linear viscous CFD solvers have also been applied to 
analyze details of the added resistance in waves (Sadat-Hosseini 
et al. 2013; el Moctar et al. 2015;Tezdogan et al. 2015; Kim et al. 
2017a; kim et al. 2017b; Kim et al. 2017c; Ozdemir and Barlas 
2017; Hizir et al. 2018). Recently Sigmund and el Moctar (2018) 
carried out state of the art numerical and experimental 

investigations on four types of ships using the finite volume 
method. The effect on added resistance of the ship's speed, 
wave steepness, skin friction and diffraction-radiation was 
analyzed in detail. Among other findings, it was found that: calm 
water and added resistance must be computed on the same 
numerical grid; radiation forces are more influenced by the 
ship's speed than by the diffraction forces; in short waves and at 
model scale frictional resistance accounts for some 20% of the 
total added resistance, while this percentage is not as high for 
full scale; and, finally, that the assumption of a quadratic 
dependence of added resistance on wave amplitude holds for 
moderate and long waves, while it does not in short waves 
because wave diffraction is dominant. However, since the use of 
CFD tools is computationally expensive, its application is limited 
to research analysis. On the other hand, potential flow solver 
are more suitable to evaluate systematically a large number of 
navigation conditions.

The main motivation of this work is the development of a new 
time-domain computational model capable of solving the wave 
making and added resistance problem efficiently. This can be 
achieved by offering am accurate approach not subject to the 
use of structured meshes.

The proposed method is based on potential flow and applies 
the free surface boundary conditions on the mean water level 
for computational efficiency. The main novelties of the model 
are the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) on unstructured 
meshes (Servan-Camas and Garcia-Espinosa 2013, Garcia-
Espinosa et al. 2015; Servan-Camas 2016; Oñate et al. 2018) in 
the context of potential flow. The proposed numerical scheme is 
derived using a non-linear (NL) formulation for the convective 
terms, although the Neumann-Kelvin (NK) and double-body (DB) 
flow linearizations have been analyzed as well.

The first scheme proposed for integrating the free surface 
boundary conditions is based on computing the convective 
term as a derivative along the streamlines. To this end a third 
order finite difference (FD) scheme using three points upwind 
and one point downwind has been tailored. The second scheme

proposed is based on the FEM with Streamline-Upwind Petrov-
Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization (Brooks and Hughes 1982).

2. Mathematical models for wave resistance 
problems

2.1 Problem statement
We consider the first-order diffraction-radiation problem of a 
body moving on the horizontal plane. Potential flow is assumed 
and the problem is formulated in terms of the velocity potential 
and free surface elevation. The following assumptions are made 
on the order of magnitude of the velocity components and free 
surface elevation:

|Vb ∼ O (1)|  , |u ∼ O (1)|  , φx ∼ O (1), φy ∼ O (1),
(1)

φz ∼ O (ϵ ), φαβ ∼ O (ϵ ), ξx ∼ O (ϵ ), ξy ∼ O (ϵ ) ,

where φ  the velocity potential, ξ is is the free surface elevation, 
Vb  is the forward speed of the moving body and u  is the 
uniform water current vector. The velocity potential and free 
surface elevation are split into incident and diffraction-radiation 
components:

φ = ψ + ϕ  , (2)

ξ = ζ + η  , (3)

 where ϕ  and η  are the diffraction-radiation velocity potential 
and free surface elevation, and ψ  and ζ  are the incident wave 
potential and free surface elevation (modeled as a set of Airy 
waves).

2.2 Governing equations in a moving frame of 
reference
The governing equations are solved in a frame of reference 
fixed to the moving body. Let the two dimensional movement of 
the local frame be defined by the horizontal velocity Vb  (see 
Figure 1). This frame of reference is assumed to match the 
global frame at time zero. For an observer sitting on the ship 
the flow field around is given by the relative motion Ub = u − Vb . 
Then the first-order diffraction-radiation equations in the local 
frame of reference are (see Servan-Camas 2016):

Δϕ = 0 in Ω , (4)

∂ϕ
∂t

+ Ub ⋅ ∇h ϕ + 12 ∇h ϕ ⋅ ∇h ϕ + ∇h ψ ⋅ ∇h ϕ + gη = 0 on z =
0,

(5)

∂η
∂t

+ (Ub + ∇h ϕ ) ⋅ ∇h η + ∇h ϕ ⋅ ∇h ζ −
∂ϕ
∂z

= 0 on z = 0,
(6)

∇ϕ ⋅ np = − (vp + u + vψ ) ⋅ np  on SB0 , (7)

∂ϕ
∂z

= 0 on z = − H ,
(8)

 where vψ = ∇ψ  , SB
0  is the body surface below z = 0, vp  is the 

velocity of a point P on SB
0 , and H  is the water depth The 

pressure induced by diffracted and radiated waves is

Pp = − ρ ( ∂ϕ∂t + (Ub + ∇h ϕ + ∇h ψ ) ⋅ ∇h ϕ − 12 ∇h ϕ ⋅ ∇h ϕ )  
in Ω .

(9)

 

Figure 1: Global and local frame of reference.

 
 

2.3 Flow linearization
 

The previous governing equations have been obtained under 
the assumption ∇ϕ ∼ O (1). Then the free surface boundary 
conditions remain non-linear and can be written as follows

 

∂ϕ
∂t

+ (Ub + ∇h ϕ ) ⋅ ∇h ϕ − 12 ∇h ϕ ⋅ ∇h ϕ + ∇h ψ ⋅ ∇h ϕ +
gη = 0 on z = 0,

(10)

∂η
∂t

+ (Ub + ∇h ϕ ) ⋅ ∇h η + ∇h ϕ ⋅ ∇h ζ −
∂ϕ
∂z

= 0 on z = 0,
(11)

 

 where Ub + ∇h ϕ  represents the convective velocity and must be 
updated every iteration to account for the variations of Ub  and 
∇h ϕ  . Retaining this assumption allows for simulating flows 
where Ub  is not steady. However, linearization of the convective 
velocity is a common practice when Ub  is steady and under 
assumptions of low speed or slender bodies. Two commonly 
used linearizations are:
 

The NK linearization: assumes ∇h ϕ ∼ O (ϵ ). Then the convective 
velocity becomes the apparent velocity Ub = u − Vb .
 

The DB linearization: assumes ∇h ϕ = ∇h ϕDB + ∇h ϕ∗ with 
∇h ϕDB ∼ O (1) and ∇h ϕ∗ ∼ O (ϵ ) . The ∇h ϕDB  flow field is 
obtained from the double-body approximation (see Servan-
Camas 2016).
 
 

2.4 Second-order pressure correction over body
 

A second-order correction on the pressure calculation is 
proposed in order to better estimate hydrodynamic loads. The 
idea is to retain second-order terms depending on the first-
order solution. Although this will not provide a full second-order 
solution, it will retain the terms contributing to mean drift loads 
( Ub = 0), and added resistance in waves ( Ub ≠ 0). The second-
order pressure correction is:

 

Pp
c (2) = − ρrp1 ⋅ ∇ (PpI + PpDR ) − ρ ( 12 ϕz ϕz + ϕz ψz + 12 ∇ψ ⋅

∇ψ ) ,
(12)

resistance in waves, Ships and offshore structures (2018). (preprint) DOI: 10.1080/17445302.2018.1483624

 where PpI  and PpDR  are pressures induced by the incident and 
diffracted-radiated waves respectively, rp1  is the first-order 
displacement of a point P over the body surface, and Pp

c (2) is the 
pressure correction term. The first term of the right hand side 
account for the pressure variation due to first order 
movements, and the second term accounts for second-order 
terms depending on first-order terms.
 
 

2.5 Second-order pressure correction on 
waterline
 

The movements of a ship and the free surface elevation modify 
the wetted surface. In order to take into account this change, a 
linear pressure is assumed from the waterline to the free 
surface (see Figure 2):

 

Ppwl = PpI + PpDR − ρgrpz , (13)

Pp
wl (2) (z ) = Ppwl − (Ppwl − Ppfs ) zξ − rpz ,

(14)

 

 where PpI  and PpDR  are evaluated at z=0, Ppwl  is the first-order 
pressure at z=0, and Pp

wl (2) represents the vertical pressure 
distribution over the water line (see Servan-Camas 2016).

3. Numerical schemes
 

3.1 Problem statement
 

Let Qh
∗ be the finite element (FE) space of interpolating 

functions, defined in the usual manner. From this space we can 
construct the subspace Qh ,ϕ  that incorporates the Dirichlet 
conditions for the velocity potential ϕ  . The space of test 
functions, denoted by Qh , is constructed as Qh ,ϕ , but with 
functions vanishing on the boundary where the Dirichlet 
conditions are imposed. Then the discrete variational finite 
element problem associated with the Eqs. (27)-(31) can be 
written as follows (Belibassakis et al. 2013): Find [ϕh ] ∈ Qh ,ϕ , by 
solving

(15)

 

 where ϕ̂ n

 are the potential normal gradients 
corresponding to the Neumann boundary conditions on bodies, 
radiation boundary and free surface, respectively. At this point it 
is useful to introduce the associated matrix form (Zienkiewicz et 
al. 2005a)

 

L̄̄ϕ = b
Z0 + bB + bR , (16)

 

 where L̄̄  is the standard FE Laplacian matrix, and b
Z0 is a vector 

accounting for the right hand side of the dynamic condition of 
the free surface, and bB  and bR  are the vectors resulting from 
integrating the other boundary condition terms.
 

Two different schemes have been developed to integrate the 
free surface boundary conditions (Eq. (10) and Eq. (11)): one 
based on FD streamline integration (FD-SLI), and the other 
based on FEM with SUPG stabilization scheme (FEM-SUPG). Both 
schemes have been tailored to account for the non-linear 
convective terms and to be used on unstructured meshes.
 
 

3.2 FD-SLI
 

The first-order free surface boundary conditions can be written 
in a general form as follows:

 

∂ϕ
∂t

+ U ⋅ ∇h ϕ +
Pfs
ρ + gη + R = 0 on z = 0,

(17)

∂η
∂t

+ U ⋅ ∇h η −
∂ϕ
∂z

+ S = 0 on z = 0,
(18)

 

 where R  and S  represent remaining terms depending on the 
linearization used. The numerical schemes adopted for solving 
the kinematic-dynamic free surface boundary conditions are 
based on Adams-Bashforth-Moulton schemes, using an explicit 
scheme for the kinematic condition, and an implicit one for the 
dynamic condition. Then ϕn +1 is imposed as a Dirichlet 
boundary condition. The schemes read as follows:

 

ϕn +1 + Δt (U ⋅ ∇h ϕ )n +1 = ϕn − Δt ( 1ρ Pfsn +1 − gηn +1 − Rn +1)  
on z = 0,

(19)

ηn +1 = ηn − Δt (U ⋅ ∇h η )n + Δt (ϕzn − Sn )  on z = 0, (20)

 

 where U  is the convective velocity and the convective terms are 
evaluated by differentiating along streamlines as:

resistance in waves, Ships and offshore structures (2018). (preprint) DOI: 10.1080/17445302.2018.1483624

(U ⋅ ∇h ϕ )n +1 = |U |n +1∂L ϕn +1 ,
(21)

(U ⋅ ∇h η )n = |U |n ∂L ηn ,
 

 where ∂L  denotes the derivative along the streamline. This 
streamline derivative is estimated using a two points upstream 
and one point downstream FD operator. Figure 3 shows the 
tracing of the streamline at node 0. The left (-1) and forward left 
(-2) points are upstream points, while the right (1) point 
corresponds to the downstream point. Then the streamline 
differential operator reads as:

 

∂L ϕ0 = w1ϕ1 + w0ϕ0 + w−1ϕ−1 + w−2ϕ−2,
(22)

∂L η0 = w1η1 + w0η0 + w−1η−1 + w−2η−2,

 

 where ϕ1, ϕ−1, ϕ−2 are interpolated between (ϕ1a , ϕ1b )  , (ϕ−1a ,
ϕ−1b )  , and (ϕ−2a , ϕ−2b )  respectively. In matrix form, the 
resulting scheme can be written as:

 

( Ī̄ + Δt W̄̄ n +1 )ϕn +1 = Ī̄ (ϕn − Δt ( 1ρ Pfsn +1 − gηn +1 − Rn +1 ) )  
on z = 0,

(23)

Ī̄ ηn +1 = ( Ī̄ − Δt W̄̄ n ) ηn + Δt (ϕzn − Sn )  on z = 0, (24)

 

 where W̄̄  and Ī̄  are the streamline convective and identity 
matrices respectively. The stencils are tailored using Taylor 
series expansion to get a third-order FD scheme along the 
streamline.
 

The associated matrix form to the FE formulation for the 
governing equations is:

 

LSL¯̄ ϕ = bSL + bB + bR , (25)

 

 where LSL¯̄  is the standard Laplacian matrix modified to account 
for the left hand side of Eq.(23), bSL  is a vector containing the 
right hand side of Eq. (23), and bB  and bR  are the vectors 
resulting from integrating the other boundary condition terms.

3.3 FEM-SUPG
 

Alternatively a FEM-SUPG (Hughes and Mallet 1986) has been 
also developed for integrating the free surface boundary 
conditions. The dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions can 
be seen as convective-transport equations of the form:

 

∂χ
∂t

+ U ⋅ ∇h χ + Q = 0.
(26)

 

 The standard FE problem associated to the above equation is
 

∀i ∫
Ω

Ni (Nj ∂χj∂t + U ⋅ ∇h Nj χj + Nj Qj )dσ = 0,
(27)

 

 where Ni  is the corresponding shape function associated to the 
mesh node i  and χj  and Qj  represent the values of χh  and Qh  at 
node j , respectively. The above equation is discretized in time as 
follows:

 

∀i ∫

Ω
Ni (Un +θ ⋅ ∇h Nj )χj n +θ dσ +

(28)

 

 where An +θ = (1 − θ )An + θAn +1. It is well known that the 
numerical solution of the previous equation may show spurious 
oscillations (Zienkiewicz et al. 2005b; Donea and Huerta 2003). 
Hence the SUPG formulation is used to introduce the necessary 
stabilization. The resulting scheme is

 In this work an explicit ( θ = 0) and implicit ( θ = 1) schemes are 
used for the kinematic and dynamic conditions respectively. The 
matrix form associated to the FE formulation of the governing 
equations is:

 

LSUPG¯̄ ϕ = bSUPG + bB + bR , (34)

 

 where LSUPG¯̄  is the standard Laplacian matrix modified to 
account for the left hand side of Eq. (32), bSUPG  is a vector 
accounting for the right hand side of Eq. (32), and bB  and bR  are 
the vectors resulting of integrating the other boundary 
condition terms.
 
 

4. Hydrodynamic loads for wave resistance 
problems
 
 

4.1 First-order loads
 

Hydrodynamic forces and moments are obtained from direct 
pressure integration over the body surface (Bai and Teng 2013). 
The body gravity center ( G ) will be used as a reference for body 
movements and moments acting on it. The resulting 
expressions for forces ( F ) and moments ( M ) can be found in 
(Servan-Camas 2016).
 
 

4.2 Second-order correction
 

Second-order correction loads are obtained by calculating the 
components of the second-order loads depending on the first-
order solution as described in section 2.5 (Figure 2). Integrating 
the corresponding second-order pressure correction:

 

FC

 The mean value of the longitudinal component of FC
(2) has a 

special meaning in the presence of waves: when U = 0 it 
becomes the mean drift force due to the waves; and when 
U ≠ 0 it becomes the added resistance in waves. Additionaly 
second-order correction of dynamic and hydrostatic loads 
resulting from the first-order rotation (see Servan-Camas 2016) 
are also taken into account in this work.
 

5. Verification and validation
 
 

5.1 Wave making resistance of an elliptic 
pressure distribution
 

5.1.1 Problem description
 

Newman and Poole (1962) derived an analytical solution for the 
wave resistance of a pressure distribution moving with constant 
forward speed along the free surface of a canal with constant 
width and depth. This solution was obtained based on a first-
order approximation with uniform flow (NK). In particular, an 
analytical expression for the elliptic pressure distribution was 
obtained. The main particulars of the elliptic pressure 
distribution used to validate the present model are given in 
Table 1:
 

Table 1: Particulars for elliptic pressure distribution.

 

Length (L) 1 m

Beam (B) 0.5 m

Water depth (H) 5 m

Channel width (W) 10 m

Free surface pressure ( Pfs ) 1 Pa

 

 The wave resistance is obtained by integrating the pressure 
distribution over the free surface as follows:

 

FW = − ∫SFS Pfs nx ds .
(37)

 

 It is assumed that the pressure distribution moves in the x 
direction. Then, in order to obtain the wave resistance, it is 
mandatory to be able to estimate the free surface deformation 
within the pressure patch.
 

5.1.2 Convergence analysis
 

Different unstructured meshes have been used for the 
numerical calculations. It has been found that refinement at the 

edge of the pressure distribution is mandatory due to the 
discontinuity in the pressure and its large influence in the free 
surface deformation, especially at low Froude numbers where 
wave lengths are smaller. Table 2 provides the particulars for 
each mesh and Figure 4 shows a detail of the finest one.

 Wave resistance was calculated for all the meshes at Froude 
number Fr=0.2, using the FD-SLI and FEM-SUPG schemes 
presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 respectively. Table 3 provides 
the values of the relative errors. Figure 5 shows the free surface 
elevation computed for Fr=0.2 with the FEM-SUPG and the finer 
mesh.

5.1.3 Verification
 

The wave making resistance has been calculated for several 
Froude numbers for the finest mesh using the FD-SLI and FEM-
SUPG. Table 4 compares analytical and numerical results. It can 
be observed that the numerical results are able to reproduce 
the analytical ones with small errors.

5.2 Wave making resistance of a Wigley hull
 

5.2.1 Problem description
 

The wave making resistance of a Wigley hull is analyzed. 
Different simulations have been performed considering the NL, 
NK, and DB free surface conditions. The FD-SLI and FEM-SUPG 
schemes have been used for integrating the free surface 
boundary conditions. Wave resistance coefficients with and 
without second-order correction have been obtained.
 

The standard Wigley hull with beam to length ratio B/L=0.1 and 
amidships section coefficient Cm=0.6667 was used. An 
unstructured mesh was generated with an element size around 
the ship of 0.01 m. The mesh generated consists of 84351 nodes 
and 476083 tetrahedral elements (see Figure 6). Only half 
domain was required due to the symmetry of the problem.

5.2.2 Second-order correction and flow linearizations
 

Figure 7 compares the dimensionless first-order wave making 
resistance coefficients Cw 1 = FDx

1 /(0.5ρSU2) and the 
dimensionless second-order-corrected wave making resistance 
coefficients Cw 2 = (FDx1 + FCx2 ) /(0.5ρSU2). They have been 
obtained using the NL, NK and DB assumptions for the case of a 
fixed Wigley hull model in still water. The wave making 
resistance forces FDx

1  and FCx
2  have been calculated as the 

longitudinal forces obtained by pressure integration (section 4). 
It is observed that the increase of resistance due to the second-
order correction term is noticeable.
 

The NK linearization leads to smaller values of wave resistance 
when compared to the NL and DB approaches, while the NL and 
DB predict similar results up to Fr=0.3.

5.2.3 Validation
 

Figure 8 compares the second-order-corrected Cw 2 numerical 
results obtained in this work with NL flow approximation 
against several experimental results: ITTC (1984) (collection of 
experimental data), Shearer and Cross (1965), University of 
Iowa, University of Tokyo (UT), and the Ship Research Institute 
of Japan (SRI). The results from Iowa, UT and SRI can be found 
in Ju (1983). Experimental data shows large dispersion and this 
might be mainly due to the uncertainty of model testing and the 
assumption of a constant form factor with speed.

Taking into account the large dispersion of the experimental 
data a fairly good agreement between the numerical and the 
experimental results has been obtained. This agreement is 
better for the higher Froude numbers. Lower Froude numbers 
require a much finer discretization in order to reproduce the 
shorter wave pattern. Figure 9 compares the wave profiles at 
the water line obtained numerically against experimental 
results. A good agreement is also found in this case.

5.3 Added resistance in waves of four modified 
Wigley hulls
 

5.3.1 Problem description
 

In this section computed added resistance is compared to that 
obtained by Journée (1992). Journée carried out an extensive 
model test campaign measuring the added resistance in waves 
of four modified Wigley hulls.. The main particulars of the 
models are given in Table 5.

5.3.2 Validation
 

The added resistance Raw  has been estimated by subtracting 
the second-order-corrected longitudinal force in still water to 
the average value of the second-order-corrected longitudinal 
force obtained in the presence of a monochromatic wave. Then 
the dimensionless wave resistance is calculated as:

 

Raw∗ =
Raw

ρgA2B2/L
,

(38)

 

 where A is the wave amplitude.
 

Simulations have been carried out with the streamlines and 
FEM-SUPG scheme using the NL flow approximations. Pitch 
damping was introduced to model the viscous dissipation 
effects, and prevent the excessive pitch movement around 
resonance obtained otherwise (see Table 5). The amount of 
damping introduced was calibrated to best fit the RAOs 
response across all Froude numbers tested.
 

Journée (1992) reported that in some case studies (for instance 
Wigley II at Fr=0.3 and Fr=0.4) it was not possible to stabilize the 
experiments, and therefore no results were obtained in those 
cases. This gives an idea on the complexity of carrying out this 
type of experiments, and the uncertainty that might be involved 
(Park et al. 2015). Moreover the added resistance in waves is a 
second-order force and usually quite small when compared to 
first-order forces, which makes very complicate to measure and 
separate both quantities. In fact, quite large models are needed 
to be able to measure second order forces, which is not the case 
of the referred experiments where the model length was 3 m. 
Since experimental data might have significant uncertainties, 
such results must be analyzed qualitatively rather than 
quantitatively.
 

Figure 10 shows a snapshot of the wave pattern generated by 
the Wigley III hull at Fr=0.2 advancing against a monochromatic 
wave with a wave length equal to the length of the hull. Figure 
11 provides the time evolution of the resistance in still water 
and in wave for the same case. The added resistance can be 
obtained from the difference between the still water resistance 
and the mean value of the resistance in wave. Figure 12 shows 
the hull geometries and mesh sizes used.
 

Figure 13-16 show the heave and pitch RAOs, as well as the 
dimensionless added resistance Raw∗ , versus the dimensionless 
wavelength for the four modified Wigley hull models.

Overall the results obtained with the FD-SLI and the FEM-SUPG 
schemes are quite similar to each other. Only in a few cases 
slight deviations are observed. Regarding the experimental 
results general trends are well captured, although in some 
cases some scattering is observed. Numerical results for RAOS 
and added resistance in waves follow reasonably well the 
experimental data although the goodness of the fitting depends 
on each case. Resonance frequencies are recovered well 
although peak values of added resistance are often 
underestimated.

6. Summary and conclusion

A FEM based model to compute the wave making resistance in 
still water and added resistance in waves has been proposed. 
The proposed method solves the governing equations in the 
time-domain, using unstructured meshes, and is not 
constrained to linearized free surface boundary conditions. The 
mathematical model is based on potential and Stokes’ 
perturbation method, which makes it computationally attractive 
compared to CFD solvers. Two different numerical schemes 
have been proposed to solve the free surface boundary 
conditions: the first one is based on a third order FD-SLI scheme 
using three upwind plus one downwind points; and the second 
one is based on the FEM-SUPG stabilization.

The proposed schemes have been verified comparing against 
analytical solutions available for a moving pressure patch, and 
validated against experimental results by comparing wave 
making resistance and wave profiles. The verification and 
validation analyses have proved that fairly good results are 
obtained by the FD-SLI and FEM-SUPG schemes.

resistance in waves, Ships and offshore structures (2018). (preprint) DOI: 10.1080/17445302.2018.1483624

Regarding the use of linearized convective terms, the following 
conclusions are made: the NK linearization might be valid for 
low Froude numbers (lower than 0.15), but it is not advisable for 
higher velocities, even for slender bodies like the Wigley hull; 
wave making resistance predictions using the DB linearization 
are quite close to the NL approach.

The numerical results of added resistance in waves have been 
validated against experimental data available for four modified 
Wigley hulls at different Froude numbers and for a number of 
monochromatic waves. Added resistance highly depend on the 
wave induced heave and pitch movements, requiring a good 
calibration of the viscous damping is mandatory. The added 
resistance in waves is a second-order force and quite small 
when compared to first-order forces, which makes it very 
complicate to measure experimentally. In fact quite large 
models are needed to be able to measure second order forces, 
which is not the case of the refereed experiments where the 
model length was 3 m. Hence experimental data has significant 
uncertainties and its results must be analyzed qualitatively 
rather than quantitatively. Taking this into account, it can be 
concluded that the present methodology has been capable of 
estimating fairly well heave and pitch RAOs, and the added 
resistance trends.
