Abstract: 

 

A loss and damage assessment was performed for the buildings of Lorca, Spain, considering 

an earthquake hazard scenario with similar characteristics to those of a real event which 

occurred on May 11
th

 2011, in terms of epicentre, depth and magnitude while also considering 

the local soil response. This low-to moderate earthquake caused severe damage and disruption 

in the region and especially on the city. A building by building resolution database was 

developed and used for damage and loss assessment. The portfolio of buildings was 

characterized by means of indexes capturing information from a structural point of view such 

as age, main construction materials, number of stories, and building class as well as others 

related to age and vulnerability classes. A replacement cost approach was selected for the 

analysis in order to calculate the direct losses incurred by the event. Seismic hazard and 

vulnerability were modeled in a probabilistic way, considering their inherent uncertainties 

which were also taken into account in the damage and loss calculation process. Losses have 

been expressed in terms of the mean damage ratio of each dwelling and since the analysis has 

been performed on a geographical information system platform, the distribution of the 

damage and its categories was mapped for the entire urban centre. The simulated damages and 

losses were compared with the observed ones reported by the local authorities and institutions 

that inspected the city after the event.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

On May 11
th

 2011 a 5.1 (MW) earthquake stroke the Murcia region in south-eastern Spain, 

where the city of Lorca, with almost 60,000 inhabitants, was the most affected and damaged 

place. The epicentre was located 5 km north of Lorca and the depth of the event was 

estimated at 5 km. The event was associated to the Alhama de Murcia local fault which

extends over more than 100 km with a strike-slip-reverse mechanism. In spite of the moderate 

magnitude of the event, 9 casualties occurred, more than 300 people were injured and around 

10,000 people could not return to their houses after the event due the damage to their homes. 

Two health centres suffered severe structural damage that endangered the security of the 

patients and medical staff, and were therefore evacuated. According to the damage surveys, 

around 80% of the inspected buildings presented some degree of damage, though it was 

generally classified as slight. The damage generated a chaotic situation in the post-disaster 

phase since there was no prior experience in implementing an emergency plan, and many of 

the response actions took longer than what was expected by the community (Barbat et al. 

2011a). 

 

According to the post-earthquake damage assessment made by the local municipality, 19% of 

the 7,852 buildings visited were not inspected from a structural engineering perspective since 

they only suffered very slight damage, 52% of the buildings were inspected and classified as 

habitable because of the lack of significant damage, 16% had no significant structural damage 

but limited access because of non-structural damage, 9% had forbidden access because of 

high structural damage, and for 4% of the buildings a mandatory demolition order was given 

(Ayuntamiento de Lorca 2012). At the same time, insured losses were quantified in around 

490 million of euros with most of the claims related to residential and commercial units (CCS 

2012). This last figure does not correspond to the total cost of the earthquake’s damage in 

Lorca because not all insurance policies have the same conditions, and the insured limits and 

deductibles are not reflected in this reported amount; nevertheless, it does provide an order of 

magnitude of the loss. 

 

Studies to estimate seismic damages and losses in the Murcia region have been performed in 

the recent past. The first one was conducted before the 2011 earthquake (Benito et al. 2005) 

where the probability of exceeding certain damage levels was obtained for the Murcia region. 

The second one was performed afterwards the earthquake, using a probabilistic approach to 

estimate future losses expressed in terms of a loss exceedance curve (Valcárcel et al. 2012). 

 

In this paper the damages and losses occurred during the Lorca 2011 earthquake are 

quantified using a probabilistic approach, based on state-of-the-art methodologies. Seismic 

hazard is represented by means of the expected intensities at ground level characterized 

through the first two probability moments. A building by building resolution exposure 

database was developed considering the public and private buildings of Lorca and capturing 

relevant information in terms of structural and non-structural parameters that combined with 

updated indexes from the latest housing census (INE 2011) allow identifying and defining a 

set of building classes. To quantify the physical vulnerability of those, vulnerability functions 

that take into account the uncertainties related to the accuracy of building characteristics and 

seismic structural performance were used. A unique vulnerability function was assigned to 

each building class identified in Lorca. The convolution between the hazard and the 

vulnerability provided the expected losses and those values were later translated into damage 

levels. Only direct physical losses were accounted for in the analysis by calculating the mean 

damage ratio (MDR) of each building of the exposure database. Second order effects, such as 

business disruption, damages to cars and other indirect damage and/or socio-economic 

impact, were not included in the estimation. The latter can be included if complementary 

information is available for other vulnerability dimensions different than the physical using 

approaches like those proposed by Carreño et al. (2007; 2012) and Barbat et al. (2011b).  

 

The obtained results have been compared with those gathered after the 2011 Lorca earthquake 



3 

 

by means of field inspections and officially reported by the local authorities (Ayuntamiento de 

Lorca 2012). It is explored whether there are similarities in the reported losses and damage 

distributions among the built stock of the urban area of Lorca and also a comparison between 

the geographical distribution of the observed and modelled damages and losses is performed. 

This is done with the objective of first, exploring the capability of catastrophe risk models to 

reproduce damages and losses within the order of magnitude of the ones observed when 

similar hazard intensities are used as input data and state-of-the-art methodologies employed 

for the exposure and vulnerability representation and second, to compare the geographical 

location (at urban level) of the observed and the modelled damages and losses, an issue that is 

considered relevant since it is not an objective of those models but since urban maps allow the 

identification of individual elements, that resolution level provides a false sense of accuracy. 

 

Several tools are available to perform a seismic risk assessment in probabilistic metrics. We 

have selected for this study the CAPRA
1
 platform (Cardona et al. 2012; 2014; Marulanda et 

al. 2013; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014; 2015; 2016; Velásquez et al. 2014) which consists of 

different modules that allow the evaluation of the seismic hazard, vulnerability and risk.  

 

The Lorca case constitutes an opportunity and a challenge to understand the strengths and 

weaknesses of the probabilistic seismic risk evaluation approach, highlighting the 

improvements required regarding exposure input data as well as for hazard, vulnerability and 

risk assessment. The outcome of this comparison is intended to contribute in the 

understanding on the capabilities and limitations of catastrophe risk models in the estimation 

of losses highlighting that even in cases such as this where no exact matches are found 

between the observed and the modelled losses, their objective of providing order of 

magnitudes for the expected losses is still fulfilled. Finally, a set of recommendations related 

to seismic safety and resilience are provided for Lorca based on not only the observed damage 

but some situations observed in the aftermath of the event. 

 

2. PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC HAZARD ASSESSMENT 
 

Based on the characteristics of the earthquake in terms of location, depth and magnitude, 

spectral shakemaps were developed using the program well-known program CRISIS (Ordaz 

et al. 2007; 2014) which is the seismic hazard module of the CAPRA Platform (Cardona et al. 

2012; 2014) in terms of a stochastic event that for each spectral ordinate considers the first 

two probability moments of the ground motion. Figure 1 shows the calculated shakemap of 

the selected event which according to the latest tectonic zonation of Spain is associated to the 

ESAS250 seismogenic source (Woessner et al. 2015), located beneath the urban area of 

Lorca. Intensities are first calculated at bedrock level using a ground motion model developed 

for the Mediterranean region (Ambrasseys et al. 2005), that in terms of magnitude and 

distances ranges is considered as suitable. Ground motion levels were compared against the 

automated shakemaps published by the USGS (USGS 2011) for 0.0s, 0.3s and 1.0s finding 

that the use of the selected ground motion prediction equation is suitable for the 

representation of this specific earthquake scenario.

al. (2014), as shown in Figure 2, to obtain the motion intensities at ground level, used to make 

the damage and loss assessment.

3. INVENTORY OF EXPOSED ASSETS OF LORCA 
 

For this study, an exposure database that considers both the public and private buildings 

within the urban area of Lorca was developed. Even if exposure databases can be constructed 

using different resolution levels, due to the data availability in this case a detailed building by 

building resolution level was chosen. This process has always presented challenges in 

modelling since usually the required information is not available directly from a unique 

source and, in many cases it needs to be inferred or generated through indexes obtained from 

several sources. In this case, information about the geographical location and structural 

characteristics such as age, material, structural system, number of stories and building class is 

required for each element. Those parameters were assigned to each of the elements included 

in the final database using the data and procedure explained in this section. When conducting 

a probabilistic seismic risk analysis, the main assumption is related to the law of large 

numbers, that is, a large set of elements are to be included in the database; this is a condition 

that is met in this paper. 

 

3.1 Available information from the cadastral data 
 

Updated cadastral information is available for Lorca with a building by building resolution 

level (MHAP 2013). Since that data was generated for cadastral and tax purposes, several 

properties other than buildings such as terraces, squares and balconies are originally included, 

having the city a total of 42,062 elements in the raw database. After a depuration process, 

intended to remove all entries different than buildings, 17,017 elements remained (buildings 

classified as ruins before the 2011 earthquake by the cadastral office were also removed since 

those were not inspected in the aftermath of the event by the local authorities). The cadastral 

information contains data about the geographical location and number of stories of each 

building. Building footprints were compared with an aerial image (ESRI 2010) and additional 

elements were included in the database for a total of 17,064 buildings. Figure 3 shows the 

map with the buildings in Lorca according to the number of stories attribute, which is an 

attribute available from the cadastral data. As shown, most of the buildings in Lorca are 

classified as low-rise from a structural point of view; i.e., buildings of 1 to 3 stories.

3.2 Vulnerability classification of the building portfolio 
 

From the most recent Spanish population and housing census (INE 2011), it is possible to 

define the age distribution of the buildings in Lorca. Using the data of Table 1, this parameter 

was distributed to the entries of the database. Since these data in the housing census is not 

geo-located, the assignation of the age parameter to each dwelling was done after performing 

a comprehensive field visit in the urban area of Lorca. 

 

Table 1 Age distribution for the buildings in Lorca 

 

 

Also, based on previous studies (Benito et al. 2005) and making use of the age distribution, a 

vulnerability classification based on the EMS-98 scale (Grünthal 1998) using the data of 

Table 2 was prepared. It can be seen from the table that structures are classified in categories 

between A and D on said scale. These data was useful for the assignation and distribution of 

building classes among the built stock, which at the same time, was validated by means of 

field visits to the urban area of Lorca. Anyhow, since some of the data used for the 

characterization of the buildings in Lorca is not originally geo-located, it is important to bear 

in mind that for this exposure database despite the field visits for data validation purposes, 

there may be cases of specific buildings that do not have assigned their particular structural 

characteristics but, on the other hand, the overall age, height, vulnerability class and building 

class share is representative of Lorca, which for these kind of analyses based on the law of 

large numbers is acknowledged to be suitable.

Figure 4 shows the geographical distribution of the vulnerability classes for the buildings of 

Lorca from where it is clear that the oldest buildings, located in the historical centre and in the 

northern area of the city are the most vulnerable from the seismic performance point of view.

3.3 Building portfolio appraisement 
 

No cadastral price information was available in the database and for that reason an index 

based on the total constructed area was obtained to capture the replacement value of each 

element. The replacement cost is intended to capture the repair or replacement cost of the 

buildings to bring them to exactly the same conditions as of today. The main objective of this 

appraisal is to establish an order of magnitude for the replacement cost of the buildings in 

Lorca as a whole. In this study, replacement costs do not take into account historical or 

heritage values of the structures. 

 

Based on data from INE (2011) a base value of 1,247 euros per constructed square meter was 

established for the city. In addition to this, and in order to take into account the fact that all 

elements do not have the same price, age was selected as a differentiation parameter. Since 

repairing stone and brick masonry buildings is more expensive than repairing reinforced 

concrete buildings due to the necessity of specialized manpower, a factor that increases with 

the age was assumed (see Table 3). 

 

Table 3 Replacement costs and age factors for Lorca 

 

 

By using this approach, the total replacement cost of the public and private buildings in Lorca 

has been established in around 7,000 million euros. 

 

3.4 Definition of building classes in Lorca 
 

By having defined the age and vulnerability class distribution, several building classes were 

identified from the information collected by Benito et al. (2005). A vulnerability class 

according to the EMS-98 scale has been assigned to each building class. Buildings in Lorca 

are mostly made of different types of masonry (bricks and stone) for the low-rise structures 

whereas for medium- and high-rise buildings reinforced concrete (R/C) waffled slab buildings 

are mostly used. Steel frames and prefabricated R/C structures are found mostly in the 

industrial facilities of the city. 

 

By combining the above mentioned two parameters for all the elements, a unique building 

class was assigned to each element, with a total of 10 building classes used for the analysis. 

Table 4 shows the building classes which were identified and assigned for this study together 

with the vulnerability classes proposed by Benito et al. (2005). In the second column an 

abbreviation code is included whereas in the third column the classification according to the 

EMS-98 vulnerability scale is shown. Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of the 

building classes of Lorca. A careful review of the assigned building classes was performed 

with the aim of avoiding unrealistic typologies such as reinforced concrete framed buildings 

built before 1900 or high-rise masonry dwellings.

Table 5 shows a summary of the exposed assets in terms of building classes, number of 

elements and replacement values of each of them.

Table 5 Summary of exposed assets statistics 

 

 

From Table 5 it can be clearly seen that most of the buildings in Lorca are made of masonry, 

concentrating more than 60% of the total both in number and in exposed value. Moreover, 

waffle slab buildings constitute the majority of the R/C structures in the city (more than 20% 

of the buildings in the city). 

 

4. PHYSICAL SEISMIC VULNERABILITY OF THE BUILDINGS 
 

Vulnerability of an urban area can be expressed considering several dimensions such as 

physical, economic, social and cultural among others (Birkmann et al. 2013). For this study 

only the physical vulnerability quantification is of interest. A vulnerability function approach 

(Ordaz et al. 1998; Miranda 1999) was selected for the damage and loss calculation process. 

Damage is represented through a continuous function that relates hazard intensities which in 

this case is the spectral acceleration for 5% damping, to the mean damage ratio (MDR), also 

considering its variance to account for the uncertainties. The value of the dispersion of the 

MDR changes along the intensity levels, being equal to zero at the extreme values of the 

interval and taking its maximum value for the intensity corresponding to a mean damage 

equal to 50%. MDR in this case corresponds to the ratio between the direct economic loss and 

the total exposed value of each building. 

 

Vulnerability functions are a description of the variation of the first two statistical moments of 

loss with respect to the hazard intensity. A Beta probability distribution function is assigned 

and, in this case, the mean value and the standard deviation correspond to the mentioned 

statistical moments. Once this distribution function is computed, all the parameters required to 

compute risk in a probabilistic way are available (Ordaz 2000). This approach is compatible 

with the probabilistic risk assessment approach selected for the study. Each of the building 

classes has an associated vulnerability function. The replacement cost of each asset is needed 

to quantify the expected losses in monetary units since what it is obtained at each intensity 

level is the ratio of the repair cost relative to the total value of the building. 

 

Structures with different characteristics behave and might be damaged in a different way 

when subjected to the lateral forces imposed by the same event and, therefore, hazard 

intensities for different spectral ordinates are calculated. This difference in the behavior of the 

buildings can be accounted using the fundamental period of each building class. Each 

vulnerability function has also an associated spectral ordinate that corresponds to the typical 

elastic fundamental period of the building class whose expected damage is being 

characterized, establishing the link between the vulnerability functions and the building 

classes. 

 

A total of 22 vulnerability functions were used in the analysis, that based on the authors’ 

opinion capture the characteristics of all the considered building classes in Lorca and capture 

the most relevant structural characteristics of the building stock in the city and were 

developed using the framework proposed by CIMNE et al. (2013). Figures 6 and 7 show the 

vulnerability functions used in this study. The codes of Table 4 are used to denote the 

vulnerability functions and the height of the structures is included in the analysis through 

three different categories: low-rise (L) for buildings between 1 and 3 stories, medium-rise (M) 

for those that have 4 to 7 stories and high-rise (H) for 8 and more; these abbreviations are also 

included in the notation used in Figures 5 and 6.

are the outcome of a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. Nevertheless, if it is required, 

the analysis can be performed for a single event. Using the methodology proposed by Ordaz 

(2000) and implemented in the CAPRA-GIS software (ERN-AL 2011), the probability 

density function is f(loss j| Event i) which allows calculating the loss on the j
th

 exposed asset, 

conditional to the occurrence of the i
th

 event. However, since it is not possible to calculate this 

probability distribution directly, a chaining process between two different conditional 

probability distributions is required, being them:

where f(lossj|Sa) has to do with the vulnerability (the expected loss given a hazard intensity) 

and f(Sa|Eventi) with the hazard (the hazard intensity given the occurrence of the event). 

Since loss is computed as a random variable, it has to be aggregated in a rigorous way. Also, 

it is important to bear in mind that since uncertainties from the ground shaking and the 

physical vulnerability are propagated to the loss results, spatial correlation has been taken into 

account. 

 

The following expressions are used for the expected value of the loss, E(p|Eventi), and its 

corresponding variance, 

Seismic risk, when calculated in a probabilistic way, is usually expressed in terms of a loss 

exceedance curve that relates the frequencies with which losses exceeding a certain amount 

occur. It is usually computed in terms of the annual exceedance rate and calculated by using

where v(l) is the rate of exceedance of loss p, N is the total number of hazard scenarios, FA 

(Event i) is the annual frequency of occurrence of the i
th

 hazard event, while Pr(L>l|Event i) is 

the probability of exceeding l, given that the i
th

 event occurred. When a single event approach 

is selected, as in this case, N takes a value equal to 1, while at the same time the frequency of 

occurrence, FA is set to 1.0. For the selected event, the intensities are first calculated for the 

area under analysis, and then for each asset included in the exposure database the loss and its 

variance are calculated using the vulnerability functions associated to each element (based on 

its geographical location and the hazard intensity value at that point). This process is repeated 

in this case for the 17,064 buildings included in the exposure database. When the risk 

assessment is performed for a single hazard event, it can be said that a deterministic approach 

is chosen for the temporal perspective whereas a probabilistic approach still remains for the 

hazard intensity calculation, vulnerability representation and loss calculation. 

 

5.2 Simulated earthquake event for Lorca 
 

In the case of a single event approach, the MDR for each building is obtained and aggregated 

for all the buildings of the city. Results can be disaggregated in terms of building classes to 

see which classes concentrate higher risk levels as it has been also done for previous fully 

probabilistic risk assessments in Lorca (Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2015; 2016). 

 

Table 6 shows the risk results in terms of the aggregated MDR for all the building classes of 

Lorca considered in this study; from this it is clear that the masonry building classes 

concentrate the higher physical risk values. Furthermore, it can be seen that the building class 

with higher MDR corresponds to earthen structures, which have proven to have poor 

performance under the seismic demand due to the poor construction practices and materials. 

Masonry structures have the highest MDR values, showing the fact that the stone masonry 

buildings present the highest risk. R/C slabs also have an important contribution to the 

modeled losses due to their high seismic vulnerability. 

 

Table 6 MDR by building class in Lorca 

 

 

According to the simulated scenario, a global MDR equal to 8.9% is expected for the 

buildings of Lorca, which in monetary units and using the replacement cost approach selected 

for this study corresponds approximately to 615 million of euros of direct losses. With the 

input data used for the risk modelling for this specific earthquake scenario, the standard 

deviation is approximately 45%. The MDR obtained if the value reported for the insured 

losses (490 million of euros) is used, corresponds to 7.1%.  

 

Since the risk assessment has been performed on a geo-coded database, the geographical 

distribution of the damage can also be geo-referenced and risk maps, in terms of the MDR, 

can be obtained for Lorca (see Figure 8).

5.3 Comparison between the simulated and the observed losses in Lorca 
 

Damage due to shear stresses was observed for a large number of buildings made of masonry 

walls which, as was mentioned, constitute the majority of the building portfolio in Lorca. For 

the R/C waffled slabs and frame structures the same damage was observed, but mainly in non-

structural elements such as façades and division walls (these walls were constructed mostly 

with brick masonry). Damage due to the presence of short columns was widely observed in 

R/C frame structures. The only building that collapsed during the earthquake, a 4 story R/C 

columns-and-slabs structure failed because of this effect. 

 

A comparison between the damage observed in Lorca according to the official report of the 

local authorities (Ayuntamiento de Lorca 2012) and the scenario simulated in this work was 

made. According to the inspections, the damaged buildings were classified in four categories: 

1) habitable, without significant damage; 2) with restricted access due to non-structural 

damage endangering the safety of the occupants; 3) with forbidden access because retrofitting 

actions were required; and 4) buildings with mandatory demolition orders. 

 

A total of 7,852 buildings were inspected, accounting for 44.5% of the buildings in Lorca, and 

it was observed that 19% of those did not suffer any significant damage. The distribution of 

damage among the four categories is shown in Table 7. These results have the same order of 

magnitude than other damage surveys conducted in the city by other experts and institutions 

(Benito et al. 2012; IGN et al. 2011, Barbat et al. 2011b, Álvarez et al. 2013; Menéndez et al. 

2012).

Table 7 Observed damage statistics in Lorca 

 

 

The damage survey was geo-located and a damage map is available online (Ayuntamiento de 

Lorca 2012). The number of inspected buildings can be considered as statistically significant 

and useful for establishing damage distributions along Lorca. 

 

Since the reported damages were classified into categories, in order to compare the observed 

damages with the simulated ones, MDR levels were set, using the authors’ judgment, for the 

different damage categories. Since in this case, both the observed losses and damages are of 

interest for comparison purposes, vulnerability functions instead of fragility curves have been 

used. For the first to provide damage levels, different MDR’s were assigned based on the 

author’s opinion as explained next. A demolition order is needed if MDR is higher than 40%; 

a building has forbidden access if MDR is between 16 and 39.9%; it has restricted access if 

MDR is between 10 and 15.9%; is considered as habitable if MDR is between 4 and 9.9%; 

and has no damage if MDR is lower than 4%. According to these levels, the statistics for all 

buildings in Lorca is presented in Table 8. 

 

Table 8 Damage categories statistics from the simulated scenario 

 

 

The percentage values of the simulated scenario are similar in all damage categories with the 

exception of the buildings with demolition order and restricted access. For the first case it is 

important to mention that in Lorca many buildings were not demolished because they 

presented a high level of damage but due to social, institutional and insurance reasons. Figure 

9 shows the simulated results grouped in damage categories whereas for the second case, the 

inflicted damage in the structures was suffered mostly in non-structural elements and contents 

which behavior is acknowledged to not be well captured with the vulnerability functions used 

herein.

Figure 9 Simulated damage categories for the urban area of Lorca 

 

As it is well known, physical risk estimations are intended to provide an order of magnitude 

of the expected losses and their average frequency of occurrence if a loss exceedance curve is 

computed, and to predict the exact damage and its geographical location in the area under 

analysis. The objective of this article is to compare the results of observed and simulated 

damage and loss. A model calibration is not possible from a methodological point of view 

because it cannot be based on a unique observed damage case. Since catastrophic risk models 

are mostly intended to work on a global basis, a single event is clearly not statistically 

significant. Moreover, catastrophic events have low occurrence frequencies and thus there are 

no sufficient observed damage and loss records available which can be used in a 

comprehensive calibration process. Obviously, even if a catastrophic risk model is adjusted to 

match the observed damage for a unique event, this does not guarantee the reliability for a 

different event at a different location with different characteristics. 

 

From our perspective, instead of a model calibration, what is needed is a model validation 

from the methodological perspective, making sure that seismic hazard, physical vulnerability 

and their convolution to obtain damage and loss are included in an appropriate manner into 

the probabilistic calculation algorithm. The methodology employed in this study accounts for 

the uncertainties related both hazard and physical vulnerability; assuming that input data in 

terms of hazard, exposure and vulnerability can be considered as reliable, a good estimation in 

terms of physical risk have been obtained in the case of Lorca.. 

 

6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SEISMIC RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES IN 
LORCA 

 

The fact that an earthquake with moderate magnitude caused important damages and 

disruption in the affected area, mostly in the city of Lorca, has been a concern for engineering, 



17 

 

civil defense, emergency attention and disaster risk management practitioners since it 

highlighted not only the high levels of vulnerability of different building classes but also the 

lack of preparation at a societal level to cope with this kind of events. 

 

From a structural point of view, the poor performance under earthquake solicitations of 

reinforced concrete structures with the short column and weak floor typologies were 

observed; in fact, the only building which collapsed because of the earthquake in the south of 

Lorca did so due to the first reason. Even though that Spain has had different earthquake 

resistant building codes, those are not of mandatory use and the misperception of a negligible 

seismic hazard in many regions due to the low recurrence rates of the seismic activity has 

contributed to an increase and accumulation of physical vulnerability. In the building codes, 

the use of those typologies is strongly recommended against and, therefore, the use of said 

documents by architects and engineers should be mandatory and a stronger enforcement needs 

to be put in place in order to stop the increase of vulnerable dwellings. 

 

In terms of the emergency attention, since no plans were previously arranged for earthquakes 

it was observed a chaotic situation for several days which affected Lorca’s inhabitants, from 

the users of the hospital which was evacuated, to those who owned structures with forbidden 

access and did not have prompt access to habitable spaces. An emergency plan accounting for 

different earthquake scenarios that involves the participation of local and regional experts in 

the disaster risk management field is required in order to estimate the required public spaces 

for attention, number of professionals to be involved in the emergency attention and the kind 

of machinery required for the rescue operations by knowing in advance the type of materials 

required to work with as present in Lorca. 

 

Finally, ex-ante strategies based on fully probabilistic risk analyses of the city (Salgado-

Gálvez et al. 2016) such as alternative financial protection activities and/or probabilistic 

benefit-cost analyses for structural retrofitting can be developed in order to have at hand and 

in a timely manner the required resources not only for the emergency but also the 

reconstruction phase whereas at the same time achieving different goals toward the seismic 

vulnerability and risk reduction. 

 

7. CONCLUSIONS 
 

Earthquake risk models at urban level provide overall estimations that can be useful for 

decision-makers in terms of required resources and expected damages and losses of the 

portfolio even if their exact location cannot be established. Therefore, if the results are 

mapped, a building by building resolution level risk assessment can be misleading since those 

could be interpreted as an exact prediction for each building, whilst they only represent mean 

values that are representative as long as the number of elements complies with the 

requirements of the law of large numbers. Therefore, results in the best case should be 

grouped by categories, such as building classes, neighborhoods, counties, etc. 

 

In terms of the exposure database used in this study, many parameters could be captured 

without an individual survey and, therefore, a grouping process among building classes was 

followed. Data gathering processes should be encouraged at different resolution levels so that 

the collected and organized information can be used to refine and improve the damage and 

loss estimations. Continuous updates on the cadastral databases capturing parameters that are 

of interest to activities different than the taxation ones should be promoted in order to connect 

said data with the development of ex-ante seismic risk studies that allow a proper 



18 

 

quantification of the human, economic and operational resources in order to cope with the 

needs after the occurrence of earthquake events. 

 

This study presents a comparison between the observed and simulated damage in Lorca for an 

earthquake which characteristics have been defined similar to that occurred on May 2011 and 

also considered the local soil response by using the information derived from the seismic 

microzonation of the city. Damage levels have the same order of magnitude, showing that 

probabilistic approaches, such as the selected for this assessment, are useful for the risk 

quantification process, though they do not match exactly the actual observed values. 

 

An estimation of the direct losses in monetary terms has been made in this study and a gross 

value of the insured losses is also available. Whereas for the modelled losses a variability can 

be reported after taking into account the uncertainties related to the seismic hazard and 

vulnerability aspects, for the observed and reported losses said variability is unknown; 

nevertheless, it is known that it can be large and that again, the reported values are only 

intended to be reference values of the orders of magnitude. Even if these figures are not 

intended to match since the latter consider only the insured buildings and only take into 

account the insured amount, leaving out of the value corresponding to the layers associated to 

deductibles and insured limits, this case shows that an estimation within the order of 

magnitude of the losses exists which at the end is the main objective of these models.  

 

Although the reported variability in this study may sound large, it is important to understand 

that within the scope and limitations of probabilistic catastrophe risk models it can be 

considered as acceptable (Woo 2011) and that again, the purpose of this comparison is not to 

find an exact matching between the reported and modelled figures but to see whereas or not 

orders of magnitude agree. 

 

From the observed damage point of view, there are several challenges regarding how damage 

was recorded and classified if a loss evaluation calibration process is performed. Usually 

qualitative damage scales are used, and therefore, no formal ways to translate those observed 

damage into loss exist. It is also difficult to capture the damage cost since usually after a large 

event strikes a city, price increases driven by inflation and scarcity of materials occur and are 

not easy to be distinguished and included in risk assessment. 

 

Finally it is worth mentioning that after a disaster event there are decisions made not 

necessarily following technical reasons but economic and urban planning ones. Disaster 

events may trigger economic boost initiatives, generate new open public space areas and/or 

promote and encourage the stock replacement (even more when resources are available 

through an insurance consortium). Those actions are not predictable since they depend in each 

case on the economic circumstances of the event’s occurrence.
