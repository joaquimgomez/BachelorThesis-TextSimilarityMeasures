SUMMARY

We present three velocity-based Updated Lagrangian formulations for standard and quasi-
incompressible hypoelastic-plastic solids. Three finite elements, named V, VP and VPS elements are
derived and tested for benchmark for non-linear solid mechanics problems. The V-element is based on a
standard velocity approach, while for the VP and VPS elements a mixed velocity-pressure formulation
is used. The two-field problem is solved via a two-step Gauss-Seidel partitioned iterative scheme. First
the momentum equations are solved in terms of velocity increments, as for the V-element. Then the
constitutive relation for the pressure is solved using the updated velocities obtained at the previous
step. For the VPS-element the equation for the pressure is stabilized using the Finite Calculus (FIC)
method in order to solve problems involving quasi-incompressible materials. All the solid elements are
validated by solving 2D and 3D benchmark problems in statics as in dynamics. Copyright c© 2010

1. Introduction

The objective of this work is the derivation and analysis of three velocity-based Updated
Lagrangian (UL) formulations for non-linear solid mechanics. In particular, a purely velocity
scheme and two mixed velocity-pressure formulations, with and without stabilization, are
presented. From the adaptation of these schemes to the hypoelastic-plastic model, three finite
elements are derived, namely, the Velocity (V), the Velocity-Pressure (VP) and the Velocity-
Pressure Stabilized (VPS) elements.

In solid mechanics, velocity-based schemes are not largely used and generally displacement-
based approaches are preferred [24]. The main reason is that velocity formulations require a
time integration procedure also for computing the stresses of an elastic material, as for the
inelastic ones. However, there are some applications in which a velocity formulation may be

preferred. For example, a velocity approach can be useful for the description of solids that
undergo huge deformations. In industrial processes, as the extrusion and forming of solids,
the plastic (or viscoplastic) deformations are so large that the elastic strain is negligible. In
these situations, the problem becomes one of incompressible viscous, non-Newtonian flow and
a velocity-based formulation is the most appropriate scheme for its description. This is the
main idea of the so-called flow approach [15, 34, 35]. Also in the context of fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) problems, the use of a velocity formulation for solids may be very helpful. In
fact, this scheme facilitates the coupling with fluids, that are typically solved for the velocities,
and allows the solution of FSI problems with a monolithic scheme ensuring in this way a
strong FSI coupling [22, 23, 2]. In this sense, the velocity-based formulations derived in this
paper represent a further step towards the unified solution of continuum mechanics problems,
in which solids and fluids can be computed using the same solver [17, 13].

It is well known that one-field formulations, displacement-based or velocity-based
indifferently, are not enough for dealing with incompressible materials [1]. In order to avoid
numerical drawbacks, as volumetric locking or spurious hydrostatic pressure fluctuations,
multi-field elements are required [9, 14, 6]. In this work a mixed Velocity-Pressure scheme
is used for both VP and VPS elements.

One of the novelties of this work is the proposal of a new stabilization procedure for the
VP formulation and lower order elements. For this reason, linear shape functions have been
used for interpolating both nodal velocities and pressures within the elements (triangles in 2D
and tetrahedra in 3D). For incompressible or nearly incompressible materials, this combination
does not fulfill the inf − sup condition [8] and the numerical scheme needs to be stabilized. The
required stabilization is given using a Finite Calculus (FIC) procedure analogous to the one
derived in [21]. In the mentioned work the stabilization was derived for quasi-incompressible
Newtonian fluids. Here, a similar stabilization procedure, obtained by introducing only small
modifications into the scheme proposed in [21], is applied to quasi-incompressible hypoelastic
solids and implemented in the VPS-element. This operation is facilitated by the similarity
between the constitutive models for hypoelastic solids and quasi-incompressible Newtonian
fluids [17, 13].

Thanks to its rate-based definition, hypoelasticity could be included in the proposed velocity-
based schemes in a natural way. However, note that these formulations do not preclude the
extension to other constitutive laws, as hyperelastic models [4]. Using the definition of Truesdell
[32], a hypoelastic body is a material which may soften or harden in strain but in general has
neither a preferred state nor a preferred stress. The hypoelastic laws were created with the
purpose of transfering the linear theory of elasticity from the small to the finite strains regime
[32]. In [33] a deep dissertation about the differences between elasticity and hypoelasticity
is given. Hypoelastic models are not free of drawbacks [28, 19, 18]. First of all, the Cauchy
stresses need to be computed through a time integration and this must be such that the frame
invariance of the formulation is preserved. Furthermore, contrary to hyperelastic models, for
large deformations the hypoelastic laws do not guarantee that the work done in a closed
deformation path is zero [24]. However this error can be considered negligible if the elastic
deformations are small versus the total deformations [4]. For this reason, the hypoelastic
laws are often used for describing the elastic part of elastic-plastic materials, where the
plastic deformations represent the largest part of the overall deformation. This explains why
hypoelasto-plastic models have been largely used for modeling forming processes [7, 16, 11].
One of the objectives of this work is to show the reliability of the hypoelastic model despite

the mentioned inconveniences. This is done by testing the formulation with highly non-linear
solid mechanics problems, involving plasticity, large displacements and quasi-incompressible
materials. The solutions given by the V, VP and VPS elements are discussed and compared
to each other and to other numerical scheme presented in the literature.

This paper is structured as follows. First the hypoelastic-plastic model used in this work is
presented. Next the governing equations are given. In section 4 the linearization procedure of
linear momentum equations is explained in detail. Then the solution schemes for the V and
the VP elements are given. Next the FIC stabilization is introduced and the solution algorithm
for the VPS-element is described. Section 9 is devoted to the validation of the V, VP and VPS
elements through the solution of three benchmark problems. Finally the conclusions of this
work are given.

2. Hypoelastic model

The hypoelastic model is defined by a direct relation between the Cauchy stress rate tensor
σ5 and the deformation rate tensor d. Using the Jaumann measure of stress, σ5 is computed
as [4]

σ5 = c5J : d (1)

where the fourth-order tensor c5J is the Jaumann tangent moduli and d is defined as

dij =

(
∂vi
∂xj

)
(2)

For an isotropic body c5J is computed as

)
, c5J = κ1⊗ 1 + 2µI′ (3)

where the bulk modulus κ is computed from the Lamé parameters, λ and µ, as

κ = λ+

µ, (4)

1 is the second-order identity tensor and I′ is a fourth-order tensor computed as

1

3
1⊗ 1 (5)

where I is the fourth-order symmetric identity tensor and it is computed as Iijkl =

2
(δikδjl + δilδkj).

For the computation of the Cauchy stress it is required to integrate on time its material
time derivative. This is computed as

σ̇ = σ5 + Ω (σ) (6)

where Ω is a tensor that accounts for the rotations and it is required for guaranteing the frame
invariance of the scheme. This tensor is defined as

Ω = W · σ + σ ·W T (7)

where W is the spin tensor defined as

Wij =

2

(
∂vi
∂xj
−
∂vj

)
(8)

Discretizing in time Eq.(6) for the time step interval [n t , n+1 t ] and replacing σ with Eq.(1),
yields

n+1σ − nσ
∆t

= c5J : n+1d+ Ω (nσ) (9)

Ω is viewed as a correction of the Cauchy stress tensor. Thus the two tensors are joined as

nσ̂ = nσ + ∆tΩ (nσ) (10)

Note that the explicit computation of Ω is allowed only if the solid undergoes small rotations
within a time step increment. Otherwise, a proper objective integration algorithm should be
used [4].

Substituting Eq.(10) in Eq.(9), yields

n+1σ − nσ̂
∆t

= c5J : n+1d (11)

Substituting in Eq.(11) the relation for c5J using Eq.(3), yields

n+1σ − nσ̂
∆t

= (κ1⊗ 1 + 2µI′) : n+1d (12)

Hence,
n+1σ = nσ̂ + κ∆t (1⊗ 1) : n+1d+ 2µ∆tI′ : n+1d (13)

The second term of the right hand side of Eq.(13) represents the increment of the volumetric,
or pressure, part of the Cauchy stress. Thus, the following relation for the increment of pressure
holds

∆p = n+1p− np = κ∆t 1 : n+1d (14)

Hence,
n+1p = np+ κ∆t n+1dv (15)

where dv = 1 : d is the volumetric strain rate.
From Eq.(13) one may compute the updated stresses using the velocities only, or both the

pressure and the velocities, as follows

n+1σ = nσ̂ + ∆t (κ1⊗ 1 + 2µI′) : n+1d (16)
n+1σ = nσ̂ + ∆p1 + 2∆tµI′ : n+1d (17)

The plastic behavior of the hypoelastic-plastic model is described considering the J2 von
Mises flow model and an associative plasticity [4]. The von Mises law is particularly indicated
for metal plasticity and the associative plastic flow gives important benefits for the symmetry
of the tangent matrix [4].

For this model the elastoplastic tangent moduli is [4]

c5Jep = κ1⊗ 1 + 2µI
′ − 2µγn⊗ n (18)

, where H is the plastic modulus and σ̄ is the effective

stress.
Note that the continuum elasto-plastic tangent modulus tensor of this model preserves the

symmetry properties of its elastic counterpart. For elastic loading or unloading, c5Jep = c
5J .

In order to guarantee the consistency of the elastoplastic incremental scheme, a return
mapping algorithm is used. The return mapping algorithm consists of an initial trial elastic
step followed by a plastic corrector one that is activated when the yield function at a trial
elastic step takes a positive value [4]. For the J2 flow theory and associative plasticity the
return mapping is characterized to be radial with respect to the yield surface [30].

3. Governing equations

The motion and deformation of a body are described by the linear momentum equations.
These are solved using an Updated Lagrangian (UL) description. In this framework the
governing equations are integrated over the unknown configuration Ω (the so-called updated
configuration) and the space derivatives are computed with respect to the spatial coordinates.
Thus, the local form of the linear momentum equations reads

ρ
∂v

∂t
− div (σ)− b = 0 in Ω× (0, T ) (19)

where ρ is the density, v is the velocity vector, σ is the Cauchy stress tensor and b is the body
force vector and t is the time.

The set of governing equations is completed by the following conditions at the Dirichlet (Γv)
and Neumann (Γt) boundaries

vi − v
p
i = 0 on Γv (20)

σijnj − t
p
i = 0 on Γt (21)

where v
p
i and t

p
i , i = 1, ..., n are the prescribed velocities and the prescribed tractions,

respectively.
In the following, summation of terms for repeated indices is assumed unless otherwise

specified.
For mixed velocity-pressure elements, an additional equation for the pressure is required.

Thus, for VP and VPS elements also the constitutive relation between the volumetric
deformation rate and the pressure variation (Eq.(15)) is solved.

4. Linearization of the momentum equations

Integrating Eq.(19) over Ω and after standard transformations, the Galerkin expression of the
Principle of Virtual Power [4] in the UL framework for the node I is obtained as∫

where N are the shape functions, x are the spatial coordinates and fdyn, f int and fext are
the dynamic, internal and external forces, respectively, expressed in the UL framework. In this
work we use linear shape functions for approximating the velocity and pressure fields.

For convenience, the linearization of the internal forces f int is performed in the known
configuration Ω0, as for a total Lagrangian (TL) description and then the UL linearized form
is obtained via a push-forward transformation of the TL form.

Applying standard pull back tranformations to vector f int of Eq.(22), the internal forces
for a TL description TLf int read

TLf intIi =

∫

PjidΩ0 (23)

where P is the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor (also called nominal stress tensor) and
X are the material coordinates. All the variables with subscript (·)0 refer to the last known
configuration. For the sake of clarity in the notation, the terms referred to the TL description
are denoted with the left upper index TL(·). Unless otherwise specified, the variables belong
to the UL description.

The hypoelastic constitutive relations are defined for the rates of stresses and strains. Hence
it is more convenient to perform the linearization of the material derivative of the internal
forces and then integrate for the time step increment ∆t. The material time derivative of
Eq.(23) is

TLḟ intIi =

∫
Ω0

∂NI
∂Xj

ṖjidΩ0 (24)

As the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor P is not symmetric and its rate is a non-objective
measure, it is preferable to work with the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S. Ṗ and Ṡ are
related to each other through the following relation

Ṗij = ṠirF
T

T

where F is the deformation gradient tensor and it is defined as

Fij =

Thanks to the symmetry of Ṡ, the material part TLδḟm of Eq.(27) can be rewritten

considering only the symmetric part of the deformation gradient term as follows

(29)

Ṡ is related to the deformation rate through the tangent constitutive tensor, as

Ṡ =

Ė (30)

where C0 is the fourth-order constitutive tensor referred to the original configuration and Ė
is the rate of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor. This can be expressed in terms of the nodal
velocities vector v̄ as

Ė = B0v̄ (31)

In Eq.(31) and in the following, (̄·) denotes a nodal value (e.g. v̄Js is the s-component of the
velocity of node J ).

Substituting Eqs.(30,31) into Eq.(28), yields

In order to obtain the increment of the internal forces, the material time derivative of the
internal forces increment is integrated over a time step increment ∆t as

TLδfm =

In order to obtain the material tangent matrix in the UL framework, push-forward

First of all, the new integration domain is the updated configuration Ω and, for an
infinitesimal volume, this is related to Ω0 as follows

The Truesdell tangent moduli tensor c5τ is computed from the Jaumann tensor c5J (Eq.(3))

where the fourth order tensor c∗ is defined as

c∗ijkl =

2
(δikσjl + δilσjk + δjkσil + δjlσik)− δijσkl (42)

The incorporation of tensor c∗ in the material part of the tangent matrix would induce the loss
of symmetry of the overall tangent matrix. For this reason, in this work this component has
not been included, and the following approximation of the exact material part of the tangent
matrix has been considered

The whole problem is solved via a two-step Gauss-Seidel partitioned iterative scheme. First
the momentum equations are solved in terms of velocity increments. Then Eq.(59) is solved
for the nodal pressures using the updated velocities computed with the momentum equations.
Concerning the stresses, the Cauchy stress tensor is computed as the sum of its deviatoric part

Algorithm 2: Iterative solution scheme for the VP-element.

Note that for the VP-element the material part of the tangent matrix is defined by the
same tangent moduli as for the V-element (c5J). Consequently, the velocity formulation can
be easily recovered from the velocity-pressure formulation. In order to do this, the governing
equations should be decoupled by computing the Cauchy stress tensor using only the velocities
(Eq.(16)) and not as the sum of its deviatoric part and the pressure (Eq.(17)). Note that, if
decoupled, the mixed velocity-pressure formulation does not give any advantage with respect
to the velocity formulation because the problem is governed by the velocities and the linear
momentum equations only.

7. FIC-stabilization for quasi-incompressible solids

For incompressible or quasi-incompressible materials, a mixed approach is required in order
to properly satisfy the incompressibility constraint. Furthermore in the mixed schemes
interpolation functions for the unkown variables must satisfy the inf − sup condition [8],
for avoiding numerical instabilities. As previously mentioned, in this work for the mixed VP-
element we have used linear shape functions for both the pressure and velocity fields. Thus,
for the analysis of quasi-incompressible bodies the scheme has to be stabilized because the
inf − sup condition is not fulfilled [8].

The VPS-element is stabilized following the FIC approach described in [21] where an
analogous Velocity-Pressure scheme for the analysis of quasi-incompressible Newtonian fluids.
The analogies between the two formulations are remarkable. First, the schemes are solved
for the same governing equations and unknown variables. In fact, one may note that Eq.(64)
can represent also the continuity equation for a quasi-incompressible fluid [27, 26, 12]. In
particular, for κ = ∞ the canonical divergence-free continuity equation of the Navier-Stokes
problem is recovered. Furthermore, there is a strong analogy between the hypoelastic and the
quasi-incompressible Newtonian constitutive laws [17, 13]. For quasi-incompressible Newtonian
fluids the stress increment can be computed as [17, 13]

∆σf = 2µfI
′ : d+ ∆tκf1⊗ 1 : d (66)

where κf is the bulk modulus of the fluid and µf is the fluid viscosity.
From Eq.(13), the increment of the Cauchy stress for hypoelastic solids is

∆σ = 2∆tµI′ : d+ ∆tκ1⊗ 1 : d (67)

Eqs.(66 and 67) show the duality between hypoelastic and Newtonian quasi-incompressible
constitutive laws. In Eq.(66) the deviatoric and the volumetric parts of the Cauchy stress
tensor are controled by the fluid viscosity µf and the bulk modulus κf , respectively. The
equivalent roles in hypoelastic solids are taken by the second Lamè constant µ scaled by the
time increment and the bulk modulus κ. Using this equivalence, the same structure of the
stabilized mass continuity equation derived for quasi-incompressible fluids in [21] is here used
for the analysis of quasi-incompressible hypoelastic solids. This is done by just replacing the
fluid parameters µf and κf with the equivalent terms ∆tµ and κ for hypoelastic solids. From
this analogy the following stabilized equation for the pressure has been obtained(

8. VPS-element

The VP and the VPS elements differ only for the pressure equation. For the VP-element
the pressure is computed via Eq.(64) while for the VPS-element is computed using the FIC-
stabilized form given in Eq.(68).

The iterative solution incremental scheme for the VPS-element is described for a generic
time increment [n t , n+1 t ] in Algorithm 3.

For each iteration i :
1. Compute the nodal velocity increments ∆v̄: Ki∆v̄ = Ri(v̄i, p̄i)
where: Ki = Km(x̄i, c5J) +Kg(x̄i,σi) +Kρ(x̄i)

9. Validation examples

In this section the V, VP and VPS elements are tested against three benchmark problems for
non-linear solid mechanics. First, the quasi-incompressible Cook’s membrane is analyzed [10].
Then, a uniformly loaded circular plate is solved in statics using the hypoelastic-plastic model
described in Section 2. Finally a plane strain cantilever is solved in dynamics for both the
hypoelastic and hypoelastic-plastic models. The numerical solutions given by the three solid
elements are discussed and compared to the ones published in the literature.

9.1. Nearly incompressible Cook’s membrane

The Cook’s membrane consists of a tapered plate clamped on one of its sides and subjected to
a transversal load applied to the opposite side [10]. The membrane is solved considering the
Poisson ratio ν = 0.4999 and a Young modulus E = 250. The vertical load is 100. In Figure 1
the initial geometry and the problem data are given.

The problem was solved in 2D for several unstructured meshes in order to verify the
convergence of the scheme. The finest mesh tested in this problem has a mean size of 0.25
and a total of 52372 triangular elements.

The reference solution for this problem is taken from [25], where the problem was solved with

an Incompatible Bubble element. In the mentioned publication the tip vertical displacement
obtained UmaxY by other formulations is also given. Specifically the results are provided for an
FEM formulation with linear displacements and constant pressure, and the Enhanced Assumed
Strain formulation [29, 5]. For all these formulations and the finest mesh tested in [25], this
value is around UmaxY = 7.71.

The Poisson ratio 0.4999 represents a material that is almost incompressible. It is well known
that values of the Poisson ratio close to 0.5 generate numerical problems to non-stabilized
FEM schemes, such as the locking of the solution. Apart from this, the proximity to the
incompressible limit also produces ill-conditioned matrices and deteriorates the convergence of
the solution. In order to overcome these drawbacks a mixed stabilized formulation is required.
For this reason, it is expected that only the VPS-element can give a fine solution to this
problem. However the problem is also solved here using the non-stabilized V and VP elements.
Both these elements, although in different ways, suffer from instability near the incompressible
limit of the material. Despite that, this example is presented with the purpose of showing how
each formulation is affected by the mentioned drawbacks and to underline the superiority of a
mixed formulation for dealing with nearly incompressible materials.

In Figure 2 the top corner vertical displacements obtained with the V, the VP and the VPS
elements for different FEM meshes are plotted.

In Table I the numerical values are given.
From the kinematic point of view, the displacements obtained by the mixed formulation

(VP and VPS elements) are close to the expected solution, while the solution given by the
V-element locks. For the V, VP and VPS the percentage errors for the tip displacement versus
the reference solution are 5.68%, 0.707 % and 0.791%, respectively.

For the analysis of stress results, the mesh with average size 1.5 is studied. In Figure 3
the xx-component of the Cauchy stress tensor obtained with the V, VP, and VPS elements
is plotted over the deformed configurations. The figures show that both V and VP solutions
deteriorate for values of ν close to the incompressible limit of the material, while the stress
field given by the VPS-element is good and smooth.

In Figure 4 the pressure solution obtained with the VP-element and the VPS-element are
given.

9.2. Uniformly loaded circular plate

The problem analyzed in this section is a simply supported circular plate subjected to a
uniform pressure P on its top surface. The constrains of the plate are applied on its lower
edge. The plate has a radius R = 10 and thickness h = 1. The problem was presented in [20]
and solved exploiting the axisymmetry of the loaded plate. In this work, the axial symmetry
of the problem was not used and the plate was analyzed in 3D using 4-noded tetrahedra. The
average size for the tetrahedra is 0.175. This gives 214047 nodes and 1263858 tetrahedra. In
Figure 5 the FEM mesh used is shown.

Figure 5: Uniformly loaded circular plate. Initial geometry and 3D FEM mesh used.

A hypoelastic-plastic model with perfect plasticity (plastic modulus H = 0) was used. The
problem was solved with the VP-element. For the plastic part a von Mises yield criterion was
considered. The plate has Young modulus E = 107, Poisson ratio ν = 0.24 and uniaxial yield
stress σ̄y = 16000. The objective of the study is to determine the limit load for the plate. Using
the procedure described in [31], the limit load can be computed analytically by combining the
limit analysis and the finite difference method. According to this theory, the limit load can be
approximated as

Plim ≈
1.63σ̄yh

2

R2
= 260.8 (74)

The same problem was solved in [20] using eight-noded axisymmetric quadrilateral elements
with four Gauss integration points. The limit load obtained with a relatively coarse mesh (10
finite elements distributed in two layers across the thickness) is PFElim = 259.8 [20].

As in [20], the limit load has been considered as the one for which the non-linear procedure
can not longer converge for a small increment of the load.

In Figure 6 the maximum vertical displacement of the plate is plotted against the pressure
on the top surface. In Table II the numerical values are given.

For the present analysis the limit load obtained is Plim = 264.27. The relative percentage
errors versus the solutions given in [31] and [20] are 1.37% and 1.76%, respectively.

The distributed load f is applied on the free edge as a step function at time t = 0 and its
overall value is 40. The problem data are in given in Table III. The problem was proposed
and studied in [3] and here is solved with both a hypoelastic and a hypoelastic-plastic models.
First the results of the hypoelastic model are given.

Hypoelastic model

The problem was solved in 2D and 3D and using both the V and VP elements. In order to
simulate the plane strain state, in the 3D analysis the nodal displacements in the transversal
direction to the load have been constrained [3]. The reference solution is the elastic one given
in [3].

The 2D problem was solved for several structured finite element meshes in order to verify
the convergence of the scheme.

For the 3D case, the problem was solved only for a structured mesh with average size 0.125
composed by 12800 4-noded tetrahedral elements. The results for the 3D case obtained with the
VP-element are illustrated in Figure 10. The pressure contours are plotted over the deformed
configuration.

In Figure 11 the time evolution of the top corner vertical displacement is plotted for each
tested mesh. These results have been obtained with the VP-element.

According to [3], the maximum vertical displacement is UmaxY = 6.88. This value is very close
to the converged results of the V and VP elements. Table IV collects the maximum vertical
displacement obtained with the V and the VP elements for all the meshes.

The four curves plotted in Figure 12 are the converged time evolution of the top corner
vertical displacement obtained with the V-element in 3D, the VP-element in 2D and 3D and
the reference solution [3]. The curves corresponding to the V and VP elements are almost
superposed and they match the reference solution.

Hypoelastic− plastic model
The same problem was solved for an elastic-plastic material with linear hardening. The yield

stress is 300 and the plastic modulus H is 100. The problem was solved with the VP-element
and using structured meshes. The reference solution is taken from [3] where the benchmark
was proposed. In [3] the converged value for the maximum top corner vertical displacement is

10. Conclusions

We have presented three velocity-based hypoelastic-plastic finite elements for non-linear solid
mechanics. The V-element has been derived from a standard velocity approach, while the
VP and VPS elements are based on a mixed velocity-pressure scheme. The VPS-element is
stabilized using the Finite Calculus (FIC) method and used for solving problems involving
quasi-incompressible materials. The mixed velocity-pressure solution scheme consists on a
two-step Gauss-Seidel partitioned iterative algorithm. In particular, first the linear momentum
equations are solved in terms of velocity increments, as for the V-element. Then the constitutive
relation for the pressure is solved using the updated velocities obtained at the previous step. It
has been shown that the proposed hypoelastic elements are capable of solving highly non-linear
problems for standard and quasi-incompressible solids with a good accuracy. The numerical
results have agreed well with other published results using alternative schemes. The formulation
here presented will be very advantageous for solving monolithically FSI problems using the
same set of variables for the solid and the fluid [17, 13].
