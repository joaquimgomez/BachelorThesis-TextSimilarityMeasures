Abstract In this work, we design an explicit time-stepping solver for the simula-
tion of the incompressible turbulent flow through the combination of VMS methods
and artificial compressibility. We evaluate the effect of the artificial compressibility
on the accuracy of the explicit formulation for under-resolved LES simulations. A
set of benchmarks have been solved, e.g., the 3D Taylor-Green vortex problem
in turbulent regimes. The resulting method is proven to be an effective alterna-
tive to implicit methods in some application ranges (in terms of problem size
and computational resources), providing comparable results with very low mem-
ory requirements. As an example, with the explicit approach, we are able to solve
accurately the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark in a fine mesh with 5123 cells on
a 12 cores 64 GB ram machine.

1 Introduction

The presence of turbulence, which is always produced at high Reynolds numbers,
poses a challenge for the numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations.
Capturing all the scales of the turbulent flow, known as the “Direct Numerical
Simulation” (DNS) [28], or even only the larger scales in “Large Eddy Simula-
tion” (LES), involve large scale problems on very fine grids and small time steps

[31]. Taking into account the small-scale flow features in both time and space,
explicit methods with small time steps is an appealing choice. In this sense, it is
reasonable to envisage an increasing interest on matrix-free schemes as researchers
will struggle with the draconian memory requirements of the forthcoming super-
computers.

Grid-based methods can be combined with explicit time integration when sup-
plemented with an artificial compressibility method. Intensive research in this area
has been done for laminar flows, within the framework of finite difference meth-
ods [9], finite volume methods [26], or the characteristic-based splitting methods
[29]. In this work, we will develop explicit finite element (FE) schemes for turbu-
lent flows. For FE schemes, the first problem when discretising the Navier-Stokes
equations using FE methods is the fact that traditional Galerkin-based FE schemes
are not suitable for convection dominated flows when dealing with under-resolved
simulations. The second problem is the compatibility requirement between the
velocity and pressure FE spaces for stability purposes, which is known as the
LBB condition. The variational multiscale method (VMS) framework is intro-
duced to overcome these difficulties [22]. The VMS approach can be understood
as a residual-based stabilised FE method, and so, the singularly perturbed nature
of the Navier-Stokes equations is stabilised as the Reynolds number increases. On
the other hand, it allows one to avoid the compliance of the compatibility condi-
tions (the so-called discrete inf-sup) between velocity and pressure spaces, and so,
we are able to use equal-order interpolation.

The VMS concept is an LES turbulent model for the Navier-Stokes equations,
as suggested in [10], exploited in [23], and analytically justified in [21]. One further
development of the VMS framework was to consider the subscale proportional to
the orthogonal component of the residual with respect to the FE spaces, leading
to the orthogonal subscales VMS technique [14]. Another improvement was to
consider a transient evolution equation for the subscale component, leading to the
dynamic subscales in [13]. In these situations, the projection-based VMS method
uses variational projections similar to the traditional filtered equations, which pro-
vides a numerically oriented turbulent modelling feature. Compared with classical
LES-type filters, the VMS method does not have the problem associated to in-
homogeneous non-commutative filters for wall-bounded flows. Further, the VMS
method retains numerical consistency in the FE equations, whereas Smagorinsky-

type models introduce an error of order h
4
3 . Good numerical results have been

obtained with this approach, which demonstrate its capability to compete with
traditional LES turbulence modelling approaches (see e.g. [5,16]).

The numerical solution of the VMS discretisation of incompressible flow is tra-
ditionally obtained using either a pressure segregation scheme [1] or monolithic
approaches [5], which require to solve linear systems and (possibly) nonlinear it-
erations. For large scale problems, the linear system is solved via Krylov iterative
solvers. In order to solve large scale problems with implicit methods, the main
requirement is the use of weakly scalable preconditioning techniques [3,4,30].

So far, VMS methods have been restricted to implicit time stepping tech-
niques. However, explicit methods (or matrix-free lightweight implicit methods)
are favoured in some situations, e.g., when one wants to tackle larger problems
with limited computational resources. As a result, in this paper we investigate the
possibility of imposing an explicit time-stepping approach for the simulation of
the incompressible turbulent flow through the combination of VMS methods and

artificial compressibility. We show that the resulting scheme, after the artificial
compressibility perturbation, can still provide accurate under-resolved LES simu-
lations of turbulent flows with a very limited memory consumption. The proposed
scheme can be straightforwardly applied to structured and unstructured meshes.
In particular, (multi-)linear equal-order velocity and pressure interpolation is used
in this work. Compared to other explicit methods, the built-in sub-grid compo-
nent acts as an implicit LES turbulence model and no extra turbulent modelling
is required.

This paper is split into the following sections. In Sect. 2, the governing equa-
tions of the Navier-Stokes problem and its artificial compressibility formulation are
presented. Sect. 3 combines the VMS formulation with the artificial compressibil-
ity technique. Sect. 4 presents a range of numerical results in order to demonstrate
the aspects described in previous sections, including the 2-D cavity flow, 2-D plane
mixing layer, 3-D cavity flow and 3-D Taylor Green vortex. Finally, some conclud-
ing remarks are made in Sect. 5.

2 Governing equations

2.1 Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations

Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rd where d = 2 or 3 is the spatial dimension,
with boundary Γ = ∂Ω, and let the time interval be [0, T ]. The strong form of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes problem consists of finding the velocity field u and
pressure p such that

∂tu− ν∇2u + u ·∇u +∇p = f inΩ × (0, T ),
∇ · u = 0 inΩ × (0, T ),

(1)

where f is the force vector and ν > 0 is the kinematic viscosity. System (1) has
to be supplied with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The boundary
Γ is divided into the Dirchilet boundary ΓD and Neumann boundary ΓN , satisfy
ΓD ∪ΓN = Γ and ΓD ∩ΓN = ∅. Then, the boundary and initial conditions read:

u = ū on ΓD × (0, T ), (2a)(
−pI + ν(∇u+ (∇u)T )

)
· n = t̄ on ΓN × (0, T ), (2b)

u = u0 in Ω × {0}, (2c)

where n is the unit outward vector normal to the surface Γ . To simplify the
exposition, we consider the pure Dirichlet boundary ΓD ≡ Γ .

2.2 Artificial compressibility method

The artificial compressibility formulation replaces the divergence free constraint
by adding a pseudo-time derivative of the pressure. System (1) is modified to

∂tu− ν∇2u + u ·∇u +∇p = f inΩ × (0, T )

∂tp+ ε
−1∇ · u = 0 inΩ × (0, T )

(3)



4 Liang Yang et al.

In (3), ε−1 is the artificial compressibility coefficient or pseudo compressibility
coefficient, where an artificial sound speed can be evaluated as c =

√
ε−1. As

the pressure wave speed c reaches a very large number, (3) approximates (1). A
relaxation of the incompressibility will allow one to use an explicit time stepping
scheme. However, a large artificial pressure wave speed will be a limit factor of
the explicit time stepping. The characteristic velocity ε−1 = c2 = (ASS||u||∞)2,
where ||u||∞ is the maximum norm of the velocity field, and ASS is the artificial
sound speed coefficient usually takes a value from 1 and 10. For the steady state
problem, the coefficient will not effect the final solution because the residual will
convergence to 0. The effect of ASS for turbulent flows will be investigated in the
transient numerical example, 2D plane mixing layer and 3D Taylor Green vortex.
The numerical experiments indicate that values of ASS 5 provide a good enough
satisfaction of the incompressibility constraint.

Notice that the pressure behaviour in (3) changes from elliptic to hyperbolic
(wave-propagation) character with the artificial compressibility method, and the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is a necessary condition for temporal
stability. In particular, for the problem considered the time step size ∆t has to be
such that

∆t ≤ α
∆h

c
,

where α is a factor that depends on the time integration scheme being used and
the safety margin desired, and ∆h is the minimum mesh size. In what follows, we
will assume that the time discretisation is uniform, with time step size ∆t. Time
step levels will be denoted with a superscript.

2.3 Weak formulation and notation

Let us introduce some notation. L2(Ω) denotes the spaces of functions that are
square integrable in Ω

It is a Hilbert space with scalar product

u(x)v(x) dΩ. (4)

When the integral is performed over a subdomain ω, we will denote it by (·, ·)ω.
H1(Ω) denotes the Sobolev space of square integrable functions with square inte-
gral derivative as

respectively. Moreover, H−1(Ω) denote the topological dual of H10(Ω) and 〈·, ·〉
the duality pairing between H−1(Ω) and H10(Ω). Then, the standard weak form
of (3) is the following: for each time t, find a velocity u(·, t) ∈ H1E(Ω) and a
pressure p(·, t) ∈ L2(Ω) such that

(∂tu, v) + ν (∇u,∇v)− (p,∇ · v) + 〈u ·∇u, v〉 = 〈f , v〉 for all v ∈H10(Ω),

(∂tp, q) + ε
−1

(∇ · u, q) = 0 for all q ∈ L2(Ω).
(5)

2.4 Galerkin FE method

Given a FE partition of the domain Ω, the problem is to construct a velocity
solution space V Eh ⊂ H

1
E(Ω) and Lh ⊂ L

2(Ω) to set the discrete problem: for
each time t, find a velocity uh(·, t) ∈ V Eh and a pressure p(·, t)h ∈ Lh such that

(∂tuh, vh) + ν (∇uh,∇vh)− (ph,∇ · vh) + 〈uh ·∇uh, vh〉 = 〈f , vh〉

(∂tph, qh) + ε
−1

(∇ · uh, qh) = 0,
(6)

for all vh ∈ V 0h and qh ∈ Lh, where V

h is constructed as V

E
h but with homoge-

neous boundary conditions. As commented above, it is well known that (6) suffers
from numerical instabilities for high Reynolds number problems. Also, the velocity
and pressure solution space must satisfy the inf-sup condition in order to have a
well-posed problem, with bounded pressure field. These difficulties can be handled
by using the VMS method.

3 Explicit Variational multiscale method

In general, the VMS method decomposes the solution u and p on a large scale
component and a subscale component. The large scale components uh and ph are
resolved by the FE mesh, whilst the subscale components ũ and p̃ are approxi-
mated by a certain analytical approach. Let us consider a scale decomposition of
spaces H1E(Ω) and L

2(Ω) such that H1E(Ω) = V h ⊕ Ṽ and L
2(Ω) = Lh ⊕ L̃,

where Ṽ and L̃ denote the infinite-dimensional spaces that complete the FE spaces
V h and Lh to approximate the velocity and pressure in the standard Galerkin FE
method. (·)h and (̃·) denote the FE component and the sub-grid component, re-
spectively. Thus, we approximate the velocity u and pressure p by

u ≈ uh + ũ, p ≈ ph + p̃,

where uh ∈ V h , ũ ∈ Ṽ , ph ∈ Lh, p̃ ∈ L̃ for each time t. Using this splitting in
(5), yields

(∂t (uh + ũ) , v) + ν (∇ (uh + ũ) ,∇v)− (ph + p̃,∇ · v)
+ 〈(uh + ũh) ·∇ (uh + ũh) , v〉 = 〈f , v〉 ,

(∂t (ph + p̃) , q) + ε
−1

(∇ · (uh + ũh) , q) = 0.

3.1 FE scale problem

First we consider FE test function, i.e. v = vh ∈ V 0h and q = qh ∈ Lh. The
resolved large-scale component of (7) yields

(∂t (uh + ũ) , vh) + ν (∇ (uh + ũ) ,∇vh)− (ph + p̃,∇ · vh)
+ 〈(uh + ũ) ·∇ (uh + ũ) , vh〉 = 〈f , vh〉 ,

(∂t (ph + p̃) , qh) + ε
−1

(∇ · (uh + ũ) , qh) = 0.

Let us elaborate on some of the terms of these equations:

– A very important ingredient of our approach is that we choose the sub-grid
spaces to be orthogonal in the L2(Ω)-sense to the FE spaces. Therefore, the
time derivative terms (∂tũ, vh) and (∂tp̃, qh) vanish:

(∂t (uh + ũ) , vh) = (∂tuh, vh) ; (∂t (ph + p̃) , qh) = (∂tph, qh) .

We show below how to satisfy this orthogonality in practice.
– The viscous term ν (∇ (uh + ũ) ,∇vh) is simplified as

ν (∇ (uh + ũ) ,∇vh)

= ν (∇uh,∇vh) + ν
∑
K

[
(−ũ,∆vh)K + (ũ,n ·∇vh)∂K

]
= ν (∇uh,∇vh) .

The term (−ũ,∆vh)K vanishes for linear elements. The term (ũ,n ·∇vh)∂K
is usually neglected in practice, although it could be taken into account using
the strategy proposed in [12].

– In order to avoid derivatives of the sub-grid component, the convective com-
ponent can be re-written as

〈(uh + ũ) ·∇ (uh + ũ) , vh〉
= 〈(uh + ũ) ·∇uh, vh〉 − 〈ũ, (uh + ũ) ·∇vh〉 ,

where we have used the fact that uh + ũ is divergence free when integrating
by parts.

– Again to avoid derivatives of the sub-grid scales, the mass conservation equa-
tion is re-written as

ε

(∇ · (uh + ũ) , qh) = ε
−1

(∇ · uh, qh)− ε

(ũ,∇qh) + ε

(n · ũ, qh)∂Ω ,

after integration by parts. As before, the sub-grid scale boundary term is ne-
glected.

Taking into account the previous considerations, the equations we have are:

(∂tuh, vh) + 〈a ·∇uh, vh〉+ ν (∇uh,∇vh)
− (ph,∇ · vh)− (p̃,∇ · vh)− 〈ũ,a ·∇vh〉 = 0,

(∂tph, qh) + ε

(∇ · uh, qh)− ε

(ũ,∇qh) = 0,

where a

= uh + ũ. The problem will be closed once an approximation for the

sub-grid scale velocity and pressure is proposed.

3.2 Local sub-grid scale problem

In this section, we discuss the sub-grid scale formulation and then give the analyt-
ical approximation of the solution. As a result, the orthogonal sub-grid scale in an
explicit VMS method will be given. The sub-grid scale equation reads (in strong
form):

∂tũ + (uh + ũ) ·∇ũ− ν∆ũ +∇p̃ = Ru,

∂tp̃+ ε
−1∇ · ũ = Rp,

where Ru and Rp are appropriate residuals of the FE components defined as

Ru = −Pu (∂tuh + (uh + ũ) ·∇uh − ν∆uh +∇ph − f) ,

Rp = −Pp
(
∂tph + ε

−1∇ · uh
)
.

Pu and Pp are projection operators onto the sub-grid scale spaces of velocities
and pressure. In the case in which we take the identity operator in both cases, we
recover the original VMS method proposed [22]. Codina [11] proposed to enforce
the subscales to be orthogonal to the FE velocity and pressure spaces. It leads to
Pu

.
= 1−Πu, where Πu is the L2-projector onto V h (using mass lumping),

i.e., for a function f , we compute the nodal values of Πu(f) at any node a of the

FE mesh as Πu(f)
a =

∫
Ω
fϕa∫
Ωϕa

, where ϕa is the corresponding nodal shape function.

We proceed analogously for Pp and Lh.
Next, we consider the following algebraic approximation of this nonlinear dif-

ferential system. We refer to [10] for a detailed exposition of the sub-grid problem
approximation, e.g., using a motivation based on Fourier transforms. After time
discretisation, e.g., using an implicit-explicit first order time integration, the ap-
proximated dynamic sub-grid model for the momentum equation reads as: compute

c1 and c2 being algorithmic constants, that we set to c1 = 4, c2 = 2 in the
numerical experiments. We can treat the sub-grid scale term implicitly because it
does not imply an increase in CPU cost. Note that the previous expressions for
the sub-grid scales are required at the integration points.

The pressure sub-grid scale component can be treated in a similar way. Again,
following the motivation explained in [10], this component can be found from:

This term is not really required to get stability and convergence bounds [2]. Fur-
ther, the exhaustive numerical analysis in [16] advocates to switch off the pressure
sub-grid component for turbulent flow simulations. In this work, we follow this
approach.

3.3 Time integration and final algorithm

The motivation for using an artificial compressibility method is the possibility to
use an explicit time integration scheme of the flow equations. Any choice is open,
but in this paper we have used a simple second order time integration scheme for
the FE solution and a first order time integration for the velocity sub-grid scales,
as described above. This is consistent since the sub-grid scales are multiplied by
the stabilisation parameters, which are of the order of the time step size. Note
that they essentially behave as the critical time step that would be found in an
forward Euler time integration [15]. The solver has been implemented in our in-
house code using Fortran90 and parallelised using OpenMP. A 2D matrix-vector
implementation is illustrated in Appendix. The final algorithm is depicted below.

4 Numerical Examples

In this section, we consider first two 2D problems to evaluate the explicit VMS
method. Next, we apply the framework to two 3D turbulent flow benchmarks.

4.1 Two-dimensional flow: lid-driven cavity

The first problem considered here is the well documented benchmark case of the
lid-driven cavity flow to test the proposed method and the implementation in 2D.
A scheme of the test problem configuration is shown in Fig. 1 (a) with the top
wall moving to the right at a velocity ux = 1. The bottom and two vertical walls
are non-slip boundaries.

(b) Computational domain: a non-uniform
structured meshes

Fig. 1 Two dimension lid driven flow

A 100×100 non-uniform structured mesh for Re = 100, Re = 1000, Re = 5000
and Re = 10000, containing finer grid points near the walls, is employed for the
computation. Since the target is to compute the steady state, we do not study the
effect of ASS in this case. The artificial sound speed is chosen to be c = 2||u||2∞.
The mesh grid point distance in the x and y directions is set to be a hyperbolic
tangent profile. For example, the y coordinates in terms of the x coordinates are
given by:

y(x) = 0.5 +
tanh(5(x− 0.5))

2 tanh(2.5)
, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1,

as shown in Fig. 1 (b).
The plots of vertical velocity profiles at the horizontal centreline and of hor-

izontal velocity profiles at the vertical centreline, at different Reynolds numbers,
are compared with the second order accurate solution by Ghia et at. [19] in Fig. 2.
A good agreement with the reference result is observed.

We also present here the numerical results at Re = 100000 performed on the
uniform grids of 5122, 10242 and 20482 for the transient case. The artificial sound
speed is chosen to be c = 3||u||2∞. In Fig. 3, it can be noticed that the coarse grid
is more diffusive than the fine grid and the bilinear element under meshsize 10242

is not fine enough to have a converged result for the lid-driven cavity flow under
Re = 100000. But the proposed method can capture the transient features of the
cavity flow for very high Reynolds number.

4.2 Two-dimensional flow: Kelvin-Helmholtz instability

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of a plane mixing layer is an important case in fluid
dynamics. This example will not lead to what is usually perceived as turbulence,
but it shows some features of the flow in common with turbulence in a certain sense,
because the flow is extremely sensitive to the initial condition and a broadband
energy spectrum of slope between k−4 and k−3 is developed [20]. The problem is
set in the domain Ω = [0, 1]× [0, 1]. Free slip boundary conditions are applied at
y = 0 and y = 1. At the left and right walls x = 0 and x = 1, periodic boundaries
are imposed, as seen in Fig. 4.

According to [6,20], the initial velocity field is set to be a hyperbolic tangent

proposed method the solution is stable for all meshes. Four different stages can
be distinguished, which can be seen in Fig. 5. Four Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices will
appear along the x-axis, that merge into two vortices and then become one.

1. Development of four primary eddies. The four primary eddies can be seen at
time unit 16. This development starts similarly for group 802, 1602, 2402, 3202.
For the coarsest mesh 402, these stages cannot be observed.

2. Pairing of four primary eddies. It can be seen that, after the mesh refinement,
the pairing starts later. At time unit 43, the different developments of both
pairings can be observed.

3. Pairing of two secondary eddies. The second pairing is finished at about 80
time units, which is close to the results in [25] (75 time units), and earlier in
comparison to [20] (115 time units) and [24] (140 time units)

4. Rotation of the final eddy. At the end of the second pairing, the final eddy
rotates at a rather fixed position. The value of the vorticity thickness oscillates
during this stage due to the elliptic shape of this vortex.

4.2.1 Mesh refinement

Fig. 6 shows the time history of the kinetic energy, the kinetic energy dissipation
rate and the vorticity thickness under mesh refinement. The eddies pairing causes
the increases of the vorticity thickness, as well as the energy dissipation. For the
coarsest mesh size 40× 40, the simulation cannot capture the four and two eddies
periods and it can only capture the final large eddy. The mesh of 80× 80 elements
is sufficient to clearly observe the development of four stages. The pairing happens
relatively slower after refining the mesh.

4.2.2 Effect of artificial sound speed

The effect of the different artificial sound speed under meshsize 320×320 is shown
in Fig. 7. It can be seen that ASS = 5 is enough to capture the key features of the
problem. Using the lower ASS number, higher kinetic energy dissipation rate and
oscillation can be observed.

4.3 Three-dimensional laminar flow: lid-driven cavity

The 3D lid-driven cavity flow illustrated in Fig. 8 is studied to examine the
performance of the proposed method and the implementation. The domain in
physical space is Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The top wall moves at a velocity
ux = 1, uy = 0, uz = 0. The bottom and four vertical walls are non-slip bound-
aries. A 1003 uniform structured mesh for Re = 100 and Re = 1000 is employed for
the computation of the laminar flow. Fig. 9 shows the isosurfaces of magnitude of
the velocity |u| = 0.15 when the flow is reached to the steady state. The artificial
sound speed is chosen to be c = 2||u||2∞, as in the 2D. Quantitive velocity profiles
were compared with the reference by Yang [32].

4.3.1 One-dimensional profile

The velocity profiles on the mid-plane y = 0.5 centrelines is illustrated in Fig.
10 for the quantitive comparisons. A good agreement has been reached with the
results obtained by Yang [32].

4.3.2 Two-dimensional profile

The velocity magnitude in the mid-plane y = 0.5 and its corresponding pressure
field is shown in Fig. 11. The pressure field is stable using the equal velocity and
pressure interpolation, which qualitatively agrees well with the results of [18].

In order to show the flow patterns of the cubic cavity flow, streamlines on the
plane of x = 0.5, y = 0.5 and z = 0.5 are presented in Fig. 12. The effects of

4.4 Three-dimensional turbulent flow: Taylor-Green vortex

The Taylor-Green vortex problem is widely used in the numerical simulation of
turbulent flow. This flow transits to turbulence and represents a basic turbulence
decay mode similar to decaying homogeneous turbulence [8,7]. The domain in
physical space is Ω = [0, 2π]× [0, 2π]× [0, 2π] with periodic boundary conditions
in all directions. Within the domain, initial velocity and pressure is defined as

ux = u0 cos(x) sin(y) sin(z)

uy = −u0 sin(x) cos(y) sin(z)
uz = 0

p = p0 +
1

16
(sin(cos(2x) + cos(2y))(cos(2z) + 2)

where u0 = 1. The initial velocity field on the Fourier space has eight modes
located at the wave number k = (±1,±1,±1). The Reynolds number of flow is
defined as Re = u0L

ν
and is equal to 1600.

The primary method for evaluating the TGV solution is examining the energy
dissipation rate. The integrated kinetic energy is given by

Ek =
1

|Ω|

∫
Ω

u · u
2

dΩ.

The temporal evolution of the kinetic energy dissipation rate is defined as

�1 = −
dEk
dt

.

A second kinetic energy dissipation rate can be defined from the integrated en-
strophy of the problem:

�2 =
2ν

|Ω|

∫
Ω

ω · ω
2

dΩ,

where ω is the vorticity of the velocity field.
Trilinear elements are employed for the simulation in a sequence of meshes

100 · 2i × 128 · 2i for i = 1, 2, 3. All the simulation were run on a single processor
desktop, including the case for 5123. The details of each cases setting were given
in Table 2. We also report the peak memory consumption for every run. In Fig. 13
we present some vorticity iso-surface images. The initial condition Fig. 13(a) has
eight vortices with the same scale corresponding to the eight Fourier modes. The
vorticity iso-surfaces are very similar to the results obtained by the implicit VMS
[16].

4.4.1 Effect of artificial sound speed

The effect of the artificial sound speed (ASS) was tested under a mesh size of 1003.
The ASS is chosen to be 3, 5, 10, 20 times the maximum of the velocity ||u||∞. Fig.
14 shows the effect of ASS on the resolved energy, the total kinetic energy evolution
and dissipation rate. It can be observed from that the resolved dissipation is very
similar for all the cases. However, the energy oscillation can be seen from time t = 0
to t = 3 due to the artificial compressibility scheme. As the ASS number increases,

the oscillation decreases, as the relaxation of the incompressibility becomes strict.
As expected, the large ASS number brings the time stepping restrictions and causes
more computational time. Table 2 also illustrates the computation times required
for the different ASS values. For the Taylor-Green vortex problem, the interest is to
study the transition period from the laminar to turbulent flow and the turbulence
decay. The energy oscillation caused by the artificial compressibility scheme is
very small before the turbulent transition. As a result, ASS equal to 5||u||∞ is
chosen for the mesh refinement simulations.

4.4.2 Mesh refinement

Fig. 15 shows the total kinetic energy and the total energy dissipation rate. The di-
rectly computing energy dissipation rate is well predicated compared with the DNS
result by [17,7]. This indicates that the turbulent structures are under-resolved and
the sub-grid scales plays a significant role in the energy dissipation. And the pro-
posed explicit variational multiscale method is able to approximate the un-resolved
scales and simulate the turbulent flow.

4.4.3 Energy spectra

The progression of the energy spectra with time on 5123 is shown in Fig. 16(a).
At t = 2 all the energy is confined to small wave numbers. As the time progresses,
the energy begins to cascade down to smaller scales. The energy in the smallest
scales peaks around t = 10. This corresponds to the maximum energy dissipation
rate. The spectra for t = 10 for a set of meshes are shown in Fig. 16(b). The finer
grid is able to capture smaller energy scales.

5 Conclusions

In this work, we have proposed a pseudo-compressible VMS solver for turbulent
incompressible flows. As a result, VMS-type LES models can now be combined
with explicit time stepping techniques. We have analyzed the resulting scheme
for a set of benchmark tests. Out of these results, we can conclude that one can
obtain accurate under-resolved LES simulations of turbulent flows by using the
proposed explicit VMS scheme with a very limited memory consumption. In par-
ticular, the transient numerical examples, 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and
3D Taylor-Green Vortex, show a good convergence with respect to the artificial
compressibility sound speed and the mesh size.

6 Appendix

Here we illustrate the matrix-vector implementation in 2D for linear FEs for sim-
plicity. The nodal shape function associated to node a is denoted by Na(x) and
its value at gauss point b is represent as Nab . Every node a is represented by the
lexicographical index (ia, ja), with ia, ja = 0, 1. Further, given the α-th axis direc-
tion, with α = 1, 2, we define the function tw(a, α) = tw(ia, ja, α) as (1 − ia, ja)
for α = 1 and (ia, 1− ja) for α = 2. We use a nodal quadrature for the numerical
integration, which leads to a lumped mass matrix. As a result, using the expression

of the nodal shape functions and their derivatives on nodes, we get:

(xb) = δab, N

(xb),

∂αN

(xtw(a,β)) = δαβ∂αN

a
(xa),

where xb denotes the coordinates of the node b and δαβ the Kronecker delta.
Using these expressions, we can implement efficiently all the terms in our matrix-
free formulation using the following expressions. The viscous term is implemented
as follows: ∫
