Abstract

This paper presents an explicit mixed finite element formulation to address compressible
and quasi-incompressible problems in elasticity and plasticity. This implies that the numerical
solution only involves diagonal systems of equations. The formulation uses independent and
equal interpolation of displacements and strains, stabilized by variational subscales (VMS). A
displacement sub-scale is introduced in order to stabilize the mean-stress field. Compared to the
standard irreducible formulation, the proposed mixed formulation yields improved strain and
stress fields. The paper investigates the effect of this enhancement on the accuracy in problems
involving strain softening and localization leading to failure, using low order finite elements
with linear continuous strain and displacement fields (P1P1 triangles in 2D and tetrahedra
in 3D) in conjunction with associative frictional Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager plastic
models. The performance of the strain/displacement formulation under compressible and nearly
incompressible deformation patterns is assessed and compared to analytical solutions for plane
stress and plane strain situations. Benchmark numerical examples show the capacity of the
mixed formulation to predict correctly failure mechanisms with localized patterns of strain,
virtually free from any dependence of the mesh directional bias. No auxiliary crack tracking
technique is necessary.

1 Introduction

In computational solid mechanics it is common to use displacements as nodal unknowns and to
calculate strains by differentiation of the interpolated displacement field. These so-called irreducible
formulations are very effective in a wide range of engineering problems; however, in certain cases,
they lead to unstable, locking or spuriously mesh dependent results.

For instance, the performance of standard low order irreducible finite elements is extremely poor
in quasi-incompressible situations, both in elasticity and plasticity. This is due to volumetric locking
that brings in overstiff behavior and mean-stress (pressure) oscillations that hamstring the stress
field. There exists considerable literature proposing solutions to this problem. Using displacements
u as primary variables, the first proposals were based on reduced integration [30, 38, 39], and
extended to the use of assumed deformations [47] and the B-bar method [31]. Mixed pressure-
displacement u − p approaches were introduced in the 90’s and used thenceforth to address the
incompressible limit [18, 29, 40, 49]. The reason for using the pressure as independent variable is
to gain control on it and ensure stability; this results in an overall satisfactory behavior of strains
and stresses in quasi-incompressible situations.

Discrete irreducible formulations have also proved inadequate in strain localization induced by
softening constitutive behavior. In this instance, unrealistic mesh dependent solutions are obtained,
with the bane of failure mechanisms, peak loads and energy dissipation being grossly mispredicted.
Like incompressibility, failure mechanics has been an active topic of research in the last 30 years,
with alternative explanations and consequent proposals being advocated. The proferred schemes go
from the introduction of localization limiters, regularized and non-local constitutive models to the
more recent phase-field simulations. In references [8, 9, 11, 25] mixed pressure-displacement u− p
finite element (FE) formulations, free from volumetric locking, were shown to tackle problems
involving isochoric J2 plasticity with strain softening and localization, obtaining non spuriously
mesh dependent results. In these works, deviatoric strains are calculated by differentiation of the
displacement field; hence, the rate of convergence for the angular distortions is the same as in the
irreducible formulation. More recently, Cervera et al. [12, 13, 14] introduced a mixed ε− u strain/
displacement FE formulation and have applied it to address problems of strain localization using
compressible and incompressible plasticity models [2, 10]. The objective of such formulation is to
achieve a discrete scheme with enhanced stress accuracy. The resulting FE formulation displays a
global rate of convergence on stresses higher than the corresponding irreducible formulation. Such
improvement of the convergence estimates also applies at local level. And this characteristic proves
to be crucial in strain localization problems involving softening materials.

In the previously referenced mixed FE element formulations, linear interpolation spaces were
used for all primary variables, displacements and pressure/strain. Three field formulations ε− u
− p have also been proposed for the incompressible limit [17, 7]. All these mixed schemes are
stabilized via the Variational Multi-Scale method (VMS) [21, 31, 32, 33, 41], and, specifically, the
Orthogonal Subgrid Scales method, in order to gain control of all the variables while circumventing
the restrictiveness of the inf-sup compatibility conditions on the choice of the interpolation spaces.
Similar mixed approaches have been proposed using alternative stabilization techniques, like SUPG
[4, 5, 29, 36] or FIC [41].

It is worth to emphasize that stabilization is a technical means that enforces stability of mixed
formulations when the selected interpolation spaces do not satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-

2



Brezzi condition (inf-sup condition). Selecting compatible interpolation spaces provides stable
results [45]. However, the LBB is very restrictive and it is not generally satisfied. Therefore, two
possibilities exist: (a) to design specific interpolations for any given situation, or (b) to choose the
interpolation spaces freely and use a stabilization technique that guarantees stability and consis-
tency.

This understood, the enhanced accuracy of the mixed ε− u strain/displacement FE formulation
derives from the consideration of the kinematic equation in weak form, rather than in strong form,
as in the irreducible formulation. Strains are interpolated independently of the displacements,
rather than obtained from local discrete differentiation. For the linear problem, this significant
enhancement of the discrete kinematics guarantees local convergence of the strain field in quasi-
singular situations. For non-linear problems, this local convergence can only be expected, not
guaranteed. However, numerical evidence on the performance of the mixed formulation in problems
with strain localization shows that the kinematical enhancement is crucial in achieving convergent
mesh independent results.

The mixed displacement-strain formulation involves a larger number of degrees of freedom
(dofs) per node than in the irreducible approach, which results in weightier systems of equations
to be solved. In reference [35], the authors proposed an explicit ε− u strain/displacement mixed
finite element formulation (MEX-FEM in the following) to address dynamic geometrically nonlinear
problems in solid mechanics. It was shown there that combining the mixed formulation with an
explicit time integration scheme yields a completely explicit mixed approach that is very cost
effective, because of two reasons. On the one hand, the nodal displacement and the nodal strains
can be solved for separately, in an staggered manner; on the other hand, only diagonal systems
of equations need to be solved. This procedure shows the feasibility of the mixed approach for
addressing other problems in solid mechanics.

Based on this, the objectives of the present work are three-fold: (i) to extend the applicabil-
ity of MEX-FEM into the quasi-incompressible elastic regime, (ii) to extend the applicability of
MEX-FEM into the compressible and quasi-incompressible plastic regime, (iii) to demonstrate that
an explicit mixed formulation can satisfactorily solve quasi-static physically nonlinear problems
involving strain localization.

Inelastic plastic flow is a directional phenomenon. Assuming associative plasticity, it occurs in
the direction normal to the yield surface. An additional objective of this work is to investigate
the performance of the proposed mixed formulation in strain localization situations to assess its
satisfactory performance under directional inelastic behavior, without spurious stress locking and
without the need of auxiliary discontinuity tracking procedures.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, the mixed approach is presented,
including the concept of subscales and the stabilization procedure. Specifically, a displacement
subscale is introduced to tackle quasi-incompressible situations. Relevant aspects of the numerical
implementation are recalled. Section 3 presents the extension of the formulation to the elasto-plastic
range. The Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager plasticity models, selected as target models, are
introduced. Constitutive integration, the return algorithm and some general aspects about the
orientation of the localization band are discussed. Section 4 presents selected numerical examples
involving unstructured and structured low order finite elements meshes (triangles in 2D and tetra-
hedra in 3D) with continuous linear strain and displacement fields to assess the generality and
robustness of the proposed formulation. Section 5 closes the paper with some conclusions.

2 Explicit mixed strain/displacement formulation

2.1 Mixed strong and weak forms

In solid mechanics, the strain field ε may be taken as an independent variable (in 3D, the symmetric
tensor ε has six components, {εxx, εyy, εzz, εxy, εyz, εxz}), additionally to the displacement fields u
(u = {ux, uy, uz}, in 3D).

In this case, the strong form of the problem, at continuous level, can be written as: find the
displacement field u, its time derivatives (velocity u̇ and acceleration ü) and the strain field ε,
given the body forces b, so that:

∇ · σ + b = ρü in Ω (1)
ε−∇su = 0 in Ω (2)

where Ω ⊂ Rndim is the volume occupied by the solid in the space of ndim dimensions, ρ is the ma-
terial density and σ is the stress tensor, assumed to be expressed in terms of the strains σ = σ(ε),
via a non-linear constitutive relationship of the type σ = C :ε, with C = C (ε) being the (se-
cant) nonlinear constitutive tensor; see Section 3 for the application to plasticity models. Eq. (1)
represents the balance of momentum and Eq. (2) is the kinematic equation.

Eqs. (1) and (2) must be satisfied for all times t ∈ [0, T ] of the time interval of interest.
Additionally, the problem is subjected to appropriate Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions,
applied respectively to the parts ∂Ωu and ∂Ωt of the boundary ∂Ω, so that ∂Ω = ∂Ωu ∪ ∂Ωt and
∂Ωu ∩ ∂Ωt = ∅. Also, the variables ε, u and the derivative u̇ are subjected to initial conditions at
t = t0, so that, ε|t=t0 = ε0 = ∇su0, u|t=t0 = u0 and u̇|t=t0 = v0.

Let ω ∈ V and γ ∈ T be the test functions for the displacement and strain fields, respectively,
V and T being the functional spaces for the admissible displacement and strain fields. Multiplying
Eqs. (1) and (2) by the respective test functions and integrating by parts Eq. (1), the weak form
of the problem reads:

�

Ω

∇sω : σ dΩ+
�

Ω

ω · ρü dΩ =
�

∂Ωt

ω · t dΓ +
�

Ω

ω · b dΩ ∀ω (3)
�

Ω

γ · ε dΩ =
�

Ω

γ · ∇su dΩ ∀γ (4)

where t = σ n are the tractions on the outward direction n in ∂Ωt.
To obtain the semi-discrete form of the problem, a discrete displacement field uh, its time

derivatives (u̇h and üh) and a discrete strain field εh are defined. The discrete counterpart of Eqs.
(3) and (4) is then:

�

Ω

∇sωh : σh dΩ+
�

Ω

ωh · ρüh dΩ =
�

∂Ωt

ωh · t dΓ +
�

Ω

ωh · b dΩ ∀ωh (5)
�

Ω

γh · εh dΩ =
�

Ω

γh · ∇suh dΩ ∀γh (6)

where now ωh ∈ Vh and γh ∈ Th are test functions belonging to the finite element spaces Vh
and Th, respectively. The Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi condition (inf-sup condition) imposes

4



severe restrictions on the choices of pairs of interpolation spaces that guarantee stability and,
therefore, unicity of the solution [1, 27]. For this reason, the solution spaces cannot be chosen
freely. Unfortunately, most of low order mixed finite elements, including the simple P1P1 element,
with equal order strain/displacement linear interpolation, do not satisfy the LBB condition. This
violation manifests in spurious oscillations in the both the displacement and pressure fields that
jeopardize the numerical solution. Conveniently, the restrictions posed by the LBB condition
may be circumvented by means of stabilization techniques to provide the necessary stability to
the discrete mixed variational form. In these stabilized finite element forms, some appropriately
constructed terms are added to Eqs. (5) and (6); these terms are residual-based and vanish upon
mesh refinement, so that the consistency of the formulation is not affected. More details are given
in the next Section.

Additionally, as Eqs. (5) and (6) are discrete in space but continuous in time, a time discretiza-
tion algorithm is required. In this work, an explicit central differences scheme is used.

2.2 Variational Multiscale Stabilization

The stabilization method used in this work belongs to the remarkably successful framework of the
Variational Multiscale method (VMS) of Hughes and collaborators [33]. The fundamental idea of
the method is to distinguish two scales or resolution levels, a coarse scale, at mesh level, that can
be solved by the finite element approximation and another, finer one, that cannot be captured by
the mesh resolution, and that is called subscale. Accordingly, the approximation of the continuous
strain and displacement fields must contain components from both the scale and the subscale:

ε = εh + �ε (7)
u = uh + �u (8)

where εh ∈ Th and uh ∈ Vh are fields defined in the coarse finite element scale and �ε ∈ �T and �u ∈ �V
are the corresponding subgrid scales. Subsequently, the velocities are approximated as u̇ = u̇h+ �̇u
and the accelerations as ü = üh + �̈u.

Some technical details may be omitted by considering that the subscale enhancements behave as
bubble functions, vanishing on the elements boundaries. They can be viewed as a “high frequency”
perturbation of the finite element field, which cannot be resolved in Vh [12, 21].

Introducing the test functions �ω ∈ �V and �γ ∈ �T in the corresponding subscale spaces, the
interpolation spaces are now extended to T ≃ Th⊕ �T and V ≃ Vh⊕ �V, respectively. Each particular
stabilized finite element method is characterized by its choice of the spaces �V and �T . The classical
Galerkin method is recovered for �V = �T = {0}.

Assuming that the subscale is small compared to the grid scale, the constitutive model is con-
sidered to be driven by the later. The non-linear secant constitutive tensor is taken as C = C(ε) ≃
C(εh) [12, 13], and the plastic strain rate as ε̇p = ε̇p(σ) ≃ ε̇p(σh), so that the stress tensor in Eq.
(47) can be written as:

σ(ε) = C(εh) : εh +C(εh) : �ε = σh + �σ (9)

Introducing the two-scale approximation (Eqs. (7), (8) and (9) and their counterparts for the
test functions) into Eqs. (3) and (4), each one of these unfold into two equations, one corresponding

5



to each scale. The equation of balance of momentum, Eq. (3), yields:

�

Ω

∇sωh : σh dΩ+
�

Ω

∇sωh : �σ dΩ+
�

Ω

ωh · ρ
�
üh + �̈u

�
dΩ =Fext(ωh) ∀ωh (10)

�

Ω

∇s�ω : σh dΩ+
�

Ω

∇s�ω : �σ dΩ+
�

Ω

�ω · ρ
�
üh + �̈u

�
dΩ =Fext(�ω) ∀�ω (11)

where the terms due to the external forces Fext(ω) are:

Fext(ω) =

�

∂Ω

ω · t dΓ +
�

Ω

ω · b dΩ (12)

Similarly, the kinematic equation, Eq. (4), yields:

�

Ω

γh · εh dΩ+
�

Ω

γh · �ε dΩ =
�

Ω

γh · ∇suh dΩ−
�

Ω

(∇ · γh) · �u dΩ ∀γh (13)
�

Ω

�γ · εh dΩ+
�

Ω

�γ · �ε dΩ =
�

Ω

�γ · ∇suh dΩ+
�

Ω

�γ · ∇s�u dΩ ∀�γ (14)

where integration by parts has been used in Eq. (13).
The part of the governing equations corresponding to the subscale, Eq. (11) for the balance of

momentum and Eq. (14) for kinematic compatibility, cannot be solved in the finite element space,
and so an approximation for the subscales is required. Grouping terms, these equations read:

�

Ω

�ω · (∇ · (C : �ε)) dΩ+
�

Ω

�ω · ρ �̈u dΩ =
�

Ω

�ω · ru,h dΩ (15)
�

Ω

�γ · �ε dΩ−
�

Ω

�γ · ∇s�u dΩ =
�

Ω

�γ · rε,h dΩ (16)

where the point-wise residuals corresponding to the finite element scale are introduced as:

ru,h = ∇ · σ + b− ρüh (17)
rε,h = ∇suh − εh (18)

This system of equations for the subscales can be written as:

P�V
�
∇ ·C : �ε + ρ�̈u

�
= P�V (ru,h) (19)

P�T (�ε−∇
s�u) = P�T (rε,h) (20)

where P�V (·) and P�T (·) are the L
2 projection operators onto the subscale spaces, �V and �T , respec-

tively, defined by the expressions:

�

Ω

�ω · P�V (·) dΩ =
�

Ω

�ω · (·) dΩ (21)
�

Ω

�γ · P�T (·) dΩ =
�

Ω

�γ · (·) dΩ (22)

The system (19)-(20) clearly relates the subscales with the projection of the discrete residuals cor-
responding to the finite element scale, and suggests constructing a residual-based approximation
for them. For this purpose, it is necessary to approximate the spatial and time differential opera-
tors that appear in the variational statement in discrete form. Regarding the spatial derivatives,
Fourier’s analysis of the problem for the subscales [21] shows that, within each element domain Ωe,
the following algrebraic approximations can be used for their respective norms:

(25)

where cε > 0 and cu > 0 are non-dimensional algorithmic constants, h is the element size, L0 is a
characteristic length of the problem and µ is the secant shear modulus; it has been assumed that
L0 >> h. Numerical evidence shows that the constants cε and cu are O(1) and can be chosen in
the range [0.1, 10.0].

Regarding the approximation of the time derivative �̈u, let us consider a uniform partition of
the time interval [0, T ] of size ∆t is considered, so that time tn = n∆t. Using a central difference
scheme, it is:

�̈u
n
≃ 1
∆t2

(�un+1 − 2�un + �un−1) (26)

Using the approximations (23)-(24) and (26) in Eqs. (19)-(20), the subscales at time n+ 1 are
calculated as:

(28)

For steady-state situations, when �̈u
n
= 0, the quasi-static approximation �u = τuP�V (ru,h) is

properly recovered.
Observe that the point-wise values of �ε and �u are not used, and thus Eqs. (27)-(28) need not

to be understood point-wise. This approximation for the subscales is substituted in the integral
terms in Eqs. (10) and (13), in order to mimic the stabilizing effect of the exact subscales. This is
why the stabilization method is termed variational multiscale method.

2.3 Orthogonal Subscale Stabilization

Is is clear from Eqs. (27) and (28) that there exist multiple possibilities to approximate the subscales,
as they can chosen in any space complementary to the finite element space. To fully define the
stabilization method and compute the subscales, the complementary spaces �V and �T , and the

7



corresponding projections Pε and Pu, must be selected. The simplest possible projection is the
identity I. The procedure so defined is called Algebraic Sub-Scales (ASGS) [20]. Residual based
stabilization techniques such as ASGS do not introduce any consistency error, as the exact solution
annuls the added terms, so that the stabilized model converges to the solution of the problem in
continuous format. Also, if designed properly, the convergence rate is not altered; that is, the
subscale terms are appropriately dependent on the mesh size.

Alternatively, Codina proposed to take the subscale spaces �V and �T orthogonal to the finite
element spaces Vh and Th. This is called theOrthogonal Sub-Scales (OSS) method [20, 21, 22]. In the
present case, this means that the strain and displacement spaces are approximated as T ≃ Th⊕T ⊥h
and V ≃ Vh⊕V⊥h , respectively. Constructing the subscales in the subspace orthogonal to the finite
element subspace has several advantages over the many other possibilities. The main one is that
it guarantees minimal numerical dissipation on the discrete solution, because it adds nothing to
those components of the residual already belonging to the FE subspace. This maximizes accuracy
for a given mesh. Additionally, in transient problems, the residual term corresponding to the
time derivative belongs to the finite element space, Ph(ρüh) = ρüh, and therefore, its orthogonal
projection is null. This means that the mass matrix remains unaltered by the stabilization method,
maintaining its structure and symmetry. In this work we will make use of this method.

Let the orthogonal projection operator be P⊥h (·) = (·)−Ph(·), where Ph(·) is the L2 projection
onto the finite element space, or least square fitting. Let us assume that the body forces b can
be described completely in Vh, so that P⊥h (b) = 0 [10, 17]. Using the orthogonal projection, the
subscales �ε and �u in Eqs. (27)-(28) become:

The residual in Eq. (17) may be split as ∇ · σh = ∇ph +∇ · sh, being sh the deviatoric stress
tensor and ph the mean stress. In quasi-incompressible situations, it has been found to be effective
to use only the mean stress gradient ∇ph in the approximation for the displacement subscale [10]:

This alternative has three advantages: (i) it reduces the computational stencil, (ii) it allows more
selective norms to be defined for stability control and (iii) it has proved advantageous in problems
involving singular or quasi-singular points. This variant of split-OSS belongs to the family of the
term-by-term stabilization methods; the introduced consistency error is of optimal order and the
final convergence rate of the scheme is not altered.

2.4 Explicit stabilized mixed form

To obtain the explicit stabilized form of the problem defined by the equations to be solved in the
finite element space, Eqs. (10) and (13), the former needs to be discretized in time. Doing this via an
explicit time advancing scheme is a well-known procedure for the irreducible formulation. Reference

8



[35] discusses the relative merits of doing this for the mixed formulation, that is, incorporating the
solution of the weak form of the geometric equation into the time marching scheme. The resulting
explicit mixed method is conditionally stable, but, compared with its irreducible counterpart: (i) it
shows enhanced strain and stress accuracy and (ii) it does not require a reduced critical time step.

On the one hand, the balance of momentum Eq. (10) is recalled at time tn as:
�

Ω

∇sωh : C(εnh) : [εnh + τε (∇sunh − ε̆nh)] dΩ+
�

Ω

ωh · ρünh dΩ = Fnext(ωh) ∀ωh (32)

where the stress and strain subgrid scales from Eqs. (9) and (29) and the orthogonality condition

Ω
ωh · �̈u n dΩ = 0 have been used. On the other hand, the geometric Eq. (13) is recalled at time

tn+1 as: �

Ω

γh · εn+1h dΩ =
�

Ω

γh · ∇sun+1h dΩ−
�

Ω

(∇ · γh) · �un+1 dΩ ∀γh (33)

where now the orthogonality condition

γh ·�ε dΩ = 0 has been used. From this, the strains εn+1h

are obtained as:

(34)

Substituting this into Eq. (32) and approximating ε̆nh ≃ εnh:
�

Ω

∇sωh : C(εnh) : [(1− τε)εnh + τε∇sunh] dΩ+
�

Ω

ωh · ρünh dΩ = Fnext(ωh) ∀ωh (35)

Now, grouping terms and introducing the stabilized strains ε

h

= (1− τε)εnh + τε∇
sunh, the first

term in Eq. (35) is identified as due to the internal forces:

Fnint(ωh) =

∇sωh : σn dΩ =

This allows writing the equation of dynamic equilibrium at time tn in the usual matrix/vector form:

MÜ
n
= F next − F nint (37)

whereUn is the vector of nodal displacements andM is the mass matrix, so that F nmass =MÜ
n
are

the inertial forces, and F next and F
n
int are the external and internal force vectors derived from their

variational counterparts, respectively.
Introducing the central finite difference scheme to discretize the second time derivative as:

Ü
n

∆t2
(Un+1 − 2Un +Un−1) (38)

the nodal displacements are obtained as:

Un+1 =
�
2Un −Un−1

	
+∆t2M−1(F next − F nint) (39)

This completes the definition of the explicit time marching procedure to solve the stabilized
mixed strain/displacement problem. For each time step tn+1:

9



1. Evaluate the internal forces in previous time step F nint using Eq. (36).

2. Evaluate nodal displacements Un+1 using Eq. (39).

3. Evaluate the displacement subscale �un+1 using Eq. (30).

4. Evaluate strains εn+1
h

using Eq. (34).

5. Go to next step.

The procedure is analogous to the one used for the standard irreducible formulation, apart from
the additional steps 3 and 4. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in any FE code. Furthermore,
the additional steps only require operations at element and node level that can be performed in
parallel.

The scheme requires the solution of two systems of equations: the one in step 2 to obtain Un+1

and another one in step 4 to perform the projection in Eq. (34). Both procedures are inexpensive,
as the corresponding system matrices are constructed as diagonal.

2.5 Damping

Viscous forces, that is, forces which are proportional to the velocities, are often introduced in
computational solid mechanics. The main reason for this is to model the physical dissipative
mechanisms that damps the dynamic structural response in truly transient situations. In some
quasi-static cases, algorithmic artificial damping is applied to induce a pseudo-transient response
to reach a steady-state solution. Also, numerical damping is often used in computational schemes
to filter out spurious high frequencies that may pollute the numerical solution.

In the finite element grid scale, these forces are added to the equation of dynamic equilibrium
at time tn, Eq. (37), so that:

MÜn +DU̇n = F next − F nint (40)
where F nvisc =DU̇

n
are the viscous forces, D being the damping matrix.

Making U̇
n
= (Un −Un−1)/∆t, the nodal displacements at tn+1 are obtained as:

Un+1 =M−1
�
[2M −∆tD]Un − [M −∆tD]Un−1 +∆t2(F next − F nint)

�
(41)

Mass- and stiffness-proportional damping, normally referred to as Rayleigh’s damping, is com-
monly used in linear and nonlinear solid dynamic analysis, because of its computational benefits.
In Rayleigh’s damping, the damping matrix is assumed to be proportional to the mass and stiffness
matrices:

D = αM + βK (42)

where α and β are damping coefficients. In order to preserve the efficiency of the explicit scheme,
Rayleigh’s damping is introduced in the form:

U
n+1 =

�
(2− α∆t)Un − (1− α∆t)Un−1 +∆t2M−1(F next − F nint − βKU̇

n
)
�

(43)

where the viscous force term βKU̇
n

can be evaluated element-by-element, without assembling a
global stiffness matrix.

In the variational multiscale approach, mass proportional damping is also considered in the
displacement subscale; using the time derivative �̇u

n
= (�un − �un−1)/∆t, leads to a modified Eq.

2.6 Computational implementation

Explicit time integration is effective if the mass matrix M in Eq. (39) is diagonal [19]. In this
case, the computation of the nodal displacements in step 2 of the explicit scheme is trivial. The
same applies to the projection matrix that appears to perform step 4. This is a mass-like matrix
that may be constructed as diagonal. In this work, a closed Gauss-Lobatto quadrature and mass
proportional damping are used to ensure that all the matrices computed are diagonal.

Consider a P1P1 4-noded tetrahedal element with the same linear interpolation functions for
strains and displacements. In the mixed formulation, strains are linear, and a 4-point quadrature
rule, sampling at the element nodes is necessary to evaluate the internal forces. Therefore, the
same close quadrature with sampling at the nodes is used for all integrals over the element domain
Ωe.

The test functions ωh in the displacements space and γh in the strains space coincide with the
interpolation functions, conventionally written in matrix form as Nκ = [N

Displacements and strains are interpolated inside each element from the nodal values as:

being N iu =diag{Ni,Ni, Ni} the 3× 3 diagonal submatrix for the displacement interpolation func-

onal submatrix for the strain interpolation function, Σi = {εixx,h,εiyy,h, εizz,h,εixy,h,εixz,h,εiyz,h} the
nodal strains, all at node i .

Note also that the tensor ∇sωh appearing, for instance, in Eq. (36), is the discrete symmetric
gradient operator, usually noted as Bu in matrix form, with Bu = [B1B2B3B4], where each
submatrix Bi is:

Bi =

3 Plasticity models

3.1 Plasticity constitutive relation

In small strain plasticity, the total strain ε can be split into its elastic εe and plastic εp components

ε = εe + εp (45)

so that the stress can be written as:

σ = C0 : (ε− εp) = C0 : εe (46)

where C0 is the elastic isotropic constitutive tensor. The elasto-plastic problem is fully defined by
specifying flow rules of the type ε̇p = ε̇p(σ) for the plastic strain. The plastic strain is integrated
in time using return mapping algorithms [46].

Alternatively, the stress can be expressed in secant form as [10]:

σ =

�
C0 −

C0 : εp ⊗C0 : εp
ε : C0 : εp

�
: ε = C(ε) : ε (47)

where C = C(ε) is the secant constitutive tensor. This secant form of the constitutive equation,
not frequent in plasticity, is formally introduced to show that standard plasticity fits in the rather
general mixed strain-displacement framework described in Section 2. Observe that it is not used
in the explicit algorithm. Note also that the secant constitutive tensor in Eq. (47) has all the
expected symmetry properties.

3.2 Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager plasticity models

The Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criterion, and associated plasticity model, is used to describe the failure
of frictional materials and geomaterials in general. The behavior of these materials is characterized
by the dependence of the effective cohesion on the pressure. The plastic strains are the result of the
relative sliding and friction between particles. According to the MC criterion, plastic flow occurs
when a certain combination of shear stress τ and normal stress σn reaches a critical value:

|τ | = c− σn tanφ (48)

being c ≥ 0 the cohesion and 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2 the internal friction angle. For φ = 0 the MC model
reduces to Tresca’s model. Strain localization occurs if cohesion decreases as plastic strain grows.
The MC criterion is often written as:

Φ(τ, σn, c(εp), φ) = |τ | − c(εp) + σn tanφ = 0 (49)

where εp is the equivalent plastic strain, a scalar measure of the plastic straining. The MC criterion
can also be expressed in terms of the stress invariants or, more frequently, as six planes in the Haigh-
Westergaard space of principal stresses, where they form the characteristic hexagonal pyramid of
the MC model. One of such planes is given by:

Φ1 (σ1, σ3, c(εp), φ) = (σ1 − σ3) + (σ1 + σ3) sinφ− 2c(εp) cosφ = 0 (50)

12



(a) (b)

Figure 1: Mohr-Coulomb model (a) in 3D stress space (b) in plane stress.

where σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3 are the principal stresses. Figure 1 depicts the MC pyramid in the HW space.
Note that this is a multisurface criterion with the apex located on the hydrostatic axis, at

√
3c cotφ

from the origin.
The Drucker-Prager (DP) criterion was proposed as a smoothed version of the MC criterion.

It is also considered as an extension of the von Mises model in which the pressure dependence is
considered. In this model, plastic flow occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress
tensor J2 =

1
2
s : s and the hydrostatic pressure reach a critical combination:

Φ(σ, c(εp), φ) =
�
J2(σ) + ηp− ςc(εp) = 0 (51)

The DP criterion, Figure 2, appears in the HW space as a cone whose axis coincides with the
hydrostatic axis. Note that for φ = 0 the DP model reduces to von Mises incompressible model.
The parameters η and ς are usually chosen to approximate the MC criterion in different ways. In

(a) (b)

plane strain situations, to predict the same limit loads as with MC, η and ς are taken as [26]:

η =
3 tanφ�

9 + 12 tan2 φ
and ς =

3�
9 + 12 tan2 φ

(52)

3.3 Return mapping, multisurface plasticity and softening

At each time step, the constitutive model must be integrated to update the value of the plastic
strains. To this end, implicit algorithms to ensure that the stress stays in the yield surface during
plastic flow are often used. These are the so-called return mapping algorithms. In multisurface
associate plasticity, Koiter’s rule is used to define the plastic flow and the equivalent plastic strain
rate [46]:

ε̇p =
nact

k=1

λ̇k
∂Φk
∂σ

=
nact

k=1

λ̇kmk (53)

ε̇p = −
nact

k=1

λ̇k
∂Φk
∂c

(54)

where λ̇k are the plastic consistency parameters and nact is the number of active surfaces. The
problem consists on determining εp, λk and the active surfaces J := Φk∀k ∈ {1, 2..nact}. Also,
the plastic consistency parameters must fulfill the Kuhn-Tucker conditions extended to multiple
surfaces plasticity:

λ̇k ≥ 0 , λ̇kΦk (σ, c(εp)) ≤ 0 and λ̇kΦ̇k (σ, c(εp)) = 0 (55)
details on the procedures to integrate the MC and DP plasticity models are given in reference [26].

Furthermore, the energy dissipated during the formation of a shear band is related to the mode
II fracture energy Gf , defined per unit area. This must be related to the plastic workWp, defined per
unit volume, dissipated during the plastic flow. Assuming that in the finite element discretization,
strain localization occurs in a ban of maximum resolution, one element thick, h:

Wp =
Gf
h

(56)

The softening law for cohesion can be defined in different ways. In this work, exponential softening
is considered:

c = c0 exp

�
−2Hs
c0

εp

�
0 < εp <∞ (57)

With these softening law for cohesion, the plastic work done from the onset of plasticity (t = 0,
c = c0 and εp = 0) to full decohesion (t =∞, c = 0 and εp �= 0) is:

Wp =
� t=∞

t=0

Ẇp dt =
� t=∞

t=0

σ : ε̇p dt =
c20
2Hs

(58)

Equating (56) and (58), the softening parameter Hs depends on the material properties and the
size of the finite element discretization:

Hs =
c2
0
h

2Gf
(59)

3.4 Orientation of the localization band

Strain localization in geomaterials reveals as shear bands, narrow bands of intense straining bounded
by surfaces where strain (weak) discontinuities occur.

Several authors [3, 6, 16, 34, 37, 42, 43, 44, 48] have analytical and geometrical solutions for the
orientation of discontinuity S bands (see Fig. 3) in elasto-plastic materials using different strategies.
All of them base their solutions on the so-called localization condition, as it is a necessary condition
for the appearance of weak discontinuities and, subsequently, strain localization.

Differently, Cervera et al. [11, 15, 50] propose an alternative methodology to find analytical
solutions for the band orientation. This procedure states the conditions for boundedness of stresses
and full decohesion, which combined, are more stringent necessary conditions for the formation
of the shear band. According to this, the band orientation in an associated plasticity model does
not depend on the elastic constants (such as the Poisson’s ratio), but only on the plastic flow,
determined by the yield criterion and the stress state. Table 1 shows analytical values of the
localization angle of locale θloc for the MC and DP in plane stress and plane strain situations.
Cervera et al. [10] have verified these results numerically for J2 plasticity and the DP model using
an implicit mixed strain/displacement formulation.

4 Numerical Examples

In this Section, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed explicit stabilized mixed strain-
displacement formulation (MEX-FEM) are demonstrated by solving several benchmark tests. The
different problems involve compressible and quasi-incompressible elasticity in dynamic and quasi-
static conditions and perfect and softening plasticity with strain localization. They are also solved
in 2D and 3D.

Simulations are performed with an enhanced version of the finite element program KRATOS
[23, 24], developed at the International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).
Pre and post-processing is done with GiD, also developed at CIMNE [28]. The reference solutions
for the 2D and 3D Cook’s membrane have been obtained with fine structured meshes of 4-noded
quadrilaterals (40,166 nodes, 39,750 elements) and 8-noded hexahedra (142,191 nodes, 132,000
elements) with constant pressure and implicit HHT time integration.

4.1 Cook’s membrane. Compressible and quasi-incompressible elasticity

The proposed MEX-FEM formulation is first tested numerically on Cook’s membrane, with the
geometry shown in Figure 4. The problem is analyzed in 2D, under plane strain assumptions.
Four finite element meshes are used, with progressive level of refinement, see Figure 5. Both com-
pressible and quasi-incompressible cases are considered with elastic properties: Young’s modulus
E = 200MPa and Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.30 and ν = 0.499. Material density is ρ = 10 kg/m3.

Figure 4: Cook’s membrane. Geometry (units in mm)

Firstly, the transient dynamic analysis of the problem is addressed. In this case, the load F at
the free end of the short cantilever is applied instantly at t = 0, and it remains constant in time.
For the integration in time, the time step is selected so that conditional stability is warranted [35].
The OSS method is used for the stabilization of the mixed problem, with algorithmic constants
cu = 1.0, cε = 1.0 and L0 = 50 mm. In 2D, the size of the element is computed as h = (4/π ·A)

1

2 ,
A being the area of the element. The displacement subscale �u is computed using Eq. (44). Mass
and stiffness proportional damping with α∆t = 0.1 and β = 10−7 is used to filter out spurious high
frequencies; this damping does not emerge in the low frequency response.

Figure 6 compares the evolution of the vertical displacement at point A (top right corner) and
the mean stress at point B (bottom mid point), for the compressible case, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3,
using both the irreducible and the MEX-FEM formulation. As the mean-stress is continuous for
the mixed P1P1 element, but discontinuous for the P1 irreducible element, a continuous field is
obtained for the later for comparison, so that ph = Ph(p). Satisfactory results are obtained for the
displacements in all cases (top row); the rate of convergence for the mean stress is noticeably lower
in the irreducible case and very similar to that of the displacements for the mixed form.

Figure 7: Cook’s membrane in 2D. Results for irreducible and mixed formulations. ν = 0.499

Figure 7 shows corresponding results for the quasi-incompressible case, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.499.
Here, the advantage of the proposed mixed formulation is evident. The irreducible formulation,
on the one hand, grossly underestimates the vertical displacements, even for rather fine meshes;
the phase error is also unacceptable. On the other hand, the mean stress field is highly unstable.
Results obtained with the present mixed formulation are remarkably better, regarding amplitude
and phase, both in the displacement and stress fields.

Next, the stationary problem is solved using a pseudo-transient analysis with over-damping to
achieve a steady-state solution. The relative rate of convergence of the different formulations is
shown in Figures 8 and 9, for the compressible and quasi-incompressible cases, respectively. Results
are also shown for the MEX-FEM formulation without displacement subscale, �u = 0, as originally
presented in reference [35].

For the ν = 0.3 case, all the formulations converge satisfactorily to the correct values (1.84318 mm
for the displacement and 1.63233MPa for the mean stress) at the expected rate, that of the mixed
formulations higher for the mean stress field. However, for the ν = 0.499 case, only the present
mixed formulation converges satisfactorily to the correct values (1.55448 mm for the displacement
and 1.87245MPa for the mean stress). Furthermore, the irreducible formulation and the mixed
one without the displacement subscale produce erratic results for the mean stress.

Finally, Figure 10 shows a contour fill of the mean stress field obtained on mesh D for the case
ν = 0.499. Only the proposed MEX-FEM formulation is able to eliminate the pressure instability,
showing the betterment provided by the displacement subscale in quasi-incompressible situations.

4.2 Cook’s membrane. Quasi-incompressible elasticity in 3D

In this Section, the Cook membrane problem in Figure 5 is analyzed in 3D (thickness 10 mm) for
quasi-incompressible elastic properties, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.499. Again, four finite element meshes
are used, with progressive level of refinement, see Figure 11. In the tridimensional case, the size of
the element is taken as h = (6/π · V )

1

3 , being V the element volume. Time integration, numerical
damping and stabilization parameters are selected as for the 2D case.

Figure 13: Cook’s membrane in 3D. Convergence curves for ν = 0.499.

Results for the tridimensional dynamic analysis are shown in 12. Again, the irreducible P1
element shows an extremely poor performance due to volumetric locking. The computed displace-
ments are underestimated, even in relatively fine meshes. Phase error is also severe. Mean stress is
also unstable. Contrarily, the MEX-FEM formulation shows satisfactory results both in terms of
displacements and mean stress.

Next, the problem is solved using a pseudo-transient analysis with over-damping to achieve
a steady-state solution. The relative rate of convergence of the different formulations for the
stationary problem is shown in Figure 13. Again, the MEX-FEM with displacement subscale is the
only one capable of converging to the correct values (1.99793 mm for the vertical displacement and
1.25125MPa for the mean stress).

Finally, Figure 14 shows a contour fill of the pressure for mesh D using three different formula-
tions. Again, only the MEX-FEM formulation with displacement subscale is able to eliminate the
pressure instability.

4.3 Prandtl’s punch test. Incompressible perfect plasticity

This 2D example in plane strain is often used to assess the computation of failure mechanisms and
failure loads in plasticity models. Figure 15 shows the geometry and the mesh used in the present
analysis. Because of symmetry, only half of the domain (the right half) is considered. Dimensions
are: L = 5 m and B = 1 m. The MEX-FEM formulation with orthogonal subscale stabilization
described in Section 2 is used, with algorithmic constants cu = 1.0, cε = 1.0 and L0 = 5 m employed
for the stabilization parameters in Eq. (25). The domain is discretized with an unstructured mesh
of 2438 nodes and 4731 linear elements, both for the irreducible (P1), and the MEX-FEM (P1P1)
formulations. The problem is also analyzed with quadratic irreducible elements (P2). In all cases a
constant velocity of 10−3 m/s is imposed in the indicated area. The quasi-static problem is solved
using mass proportional damping, with α∆t = 0.1.

Material properties are: density ρ = 104 Kg/m3, Young’s modulus E = 107 KPa, Poisson’s
ratio ν = 0.48, initial cohesion c0 = 490 KPa and friction angle φ = 20

o. Both the perfectly plastic
models of Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager are used; for the latter, parameters η and ς chosen
as indicated in Eq. (52). With these values, the analytical solution for the quasi-static problem is
Plim/c0 = 14.8, where Plim is the total applied force to impose the velocity.

Figure 16 shows a contour fill of the equivalent plastic strain obtained with the MC model;
the DP model produces very similar results. The collapse mechanism obtained using the proposed
MEX-FEM formulation is very well defined. It coincides with the analytical solution and it is
independent from the orientation of the mesh. Contrariwise, the solution obtained with the linear
irreducible elements is strongly dependent on the mesh bias and it goes associated to severe stress-
locking and mean stress oscillations. Using quadratic irreducible elements slightly improves the
solution, but the stress oscillations are not fully eliminated.

Figure 17 shows the force-displacement curves for the different FE formulations and the two
plasticity models considered. Note that MEX-FEM captures satisfactorily the peak load, with
values of Plim/c0 = 15.16 for the MC model and Plim/c0 = 15.22 for the DP model, both in
close agreement with the analytical value for the perfectly quasi-static problem. For the linear
FI − P1 element, the volumetric locking is evident, and the peak load can not be identified. For
the quadratic FI − P2 element, the limit load is Plim/c0 = 15.56, somewhat overestimated.

4.4 Perforated strip under tension. Strain localization in plane strain and stress

This 2D example consists in a simply perforated strip subjected to uniform tension, by applying
uniform normal tractions at the free ends of the strip. The objectives of the benchmark are three-
fold: 1) to determine numerically the localization angle θloc for varying friction angles φ, for the
MC and DP models, 2) to investigate the effect of the Poisson’s ratio in the localization angle and
3) to compare the results obtained numerically with the analytical solutions proposed in Table 1.

Dimensions are l = 40 m, b = 20 m and d = 2 m. Thickness is 1 m. Material properties are:
Young’s modulus E = 10 MPa , Poisson’s ratio ν = {0, 0.15, 0.30}, initial cohesion c0 = 104Pa,
friction angle φ = {0o, 15o, 30o, 45o, 60o}.

Given the symmetry of the problem, only one quarter of the domain (top-right) is considered.
The domain is discretized with 3758 nodes and 7274 elements. Figure 18 shows the geometry of
the problem and the computational mesh. The MEX-FEM formulation with orthogonal subscale
stabilization described in Section 2 is used, with algorithmic constants cu = 1.0, cε = 1.0 and
L0 = 10 m employed for the stabilization parameters in Eq. (25). The problem is analyzed both
in plane strain and plane stress conditions.

The plane strain case is considered first. The results from the analyses are presented in Table
2. The ability of the MEX-FEM formulation to capture the correct direction for the localization
band, both for the MC and the DP models is remarkably demonstrated, in close agreement with
the analytical predictions.

Figure 19 shows the calculated localization bands for different friction angles φ, using the MC
model, and represented as a contour fill of the equivalent plastic strain. The collapse mechanisms
are completely independent of the mesh used, the same in all cases. For the DP model, similar
results are obtained, see Table 2.

Table 3: Analytical and numerical localization angles in plane strain for different Poisson’s ratios

Table 3 compares the numerical results obtained in plane strain for two different values of
Poisson’s ratio. It can be seen that the localization angle depends only on the plastic flow, as
predicted analytically.

The plane stress case is now considered. Table 4 compares the localization angles obtained with
the DP model in plane stress. Again, the agreement with the analytical predictions is remarkable,
independently of mesh bias. Figure 20 shows some of the obtained fields of equivalent plastic strain.
Note that for the DP model, the localization angle is substantially different in plane stress and plane
strain.

The MC model in plane stress is now considered. For plane stress, the pure tension case in
the MC model corresponds to one of the lines where two of the planes defining the yield criterion

intersect, see Figure 1. Therefore, two alternative solutions exist, with the plastic flow being normal
to plane A − C or A − B, respectively. In order to obtain one or the other solution, the applied
state of stress is perturbed by lateral normal stress of 1 KPa, applied either in compression tx < 0
or in tension tx > 0 . For tx > 0, strain localizes in a horizontal band, independent from the
friction angle, as it would occur for a Rankine model; however, for tx < 0, localization depends

4.5 Perforated thin cylinder under tension and torsion. Strain localization in
3D

The last problem to be studied is a perforated thin cylinder subjected to two different actions:
tension and torsion along its longitudinal axis. The dimensions of the cylinder are: length h = 1.95
m, external radius r = 0.50 m and thickness t = 0.05 m; the cylinder has a small square perforation
in its midplane where stresses concentrate and one or more plastic strain localization helicoidal
bands are initiated. For this geometry of the problem and for the actions considered, the stress
state is plane; therefore, the localization angles are those in Table 1 ([11, 15, 50]). Because of
symmetry, only the top half of the cylinder needs to be discretized. Geometry and the structured
FE mesh used, with 15357 nodes and 59880 tetrahedral MEX-FEM P1P1 elements, are shown in
Figure 23.

The material properties are: density ρ = 100 Kg/m3, Young’s modulus E = 102 KPa, Poisson’s
ratio ν = 0.30, initial cohesion c0 = 4 KPa and fracture energy Gf = 5 N/m. Tension and torsion
on the cylinder are induced by imposed displacements at the top plane at a velocity of 10−3m/s.

Firstly, uniform longitudinal tension is studied. A von Mises plastic model is selected as yield
criterion (Drucker-Prager with friction angle φ = 0o ). Figure 24 shows three different views of
the shear bands formed. The solution consists of two symmetrical helicoidal bands that start at
the perforation and progress towards the free end of the cylinder ±45o with the horizontal plane,
which is the direction of the minor principal stress ([11, 15, 50]). The numerical solution coincides
exactly with the analytical prediction.

Secondly, uniform longitudinal torsion is studied. In this case, the Mohr-Coulomb model is
used with a friction angle φ = 45o. For this loading, the stress state in the walls of the cylinder
is of pure shear, with principal stresses of the same value but opposite signs acting at ±45o with
the horizontal plane. According to the analytical results in Table 1 ([11, 15, 50]), shear band must
form at ±22.5o with the direction of minor principal stress, that is, at 22.5o and 67.5o with the
horizontal plane. Both alternative solutions are shown in Figures 25 and 26, respectively. In order
to obtain one and the other, the torsional problem is slightly perturbed with a small longitudinal
tension or compression, respectively.

Both for the cases of longitudinal tension and torsion, the analytical solutions are reproduced
numerically with no spurious mesh bias. Therefore, the ability of the proposed formulation to
address the problem of strain localization in elasto-plastic 3D problems is assessed. It is noteworthy
that no auxiliary tracking techniques are necessary.

5 Conclusions

This work proposes an explicit mixed strain-displacement finite element formulation (MEX-FEM),
applicable to dynamic and quasi-static problems in computational solid mechanics involving quasi-
incompressibility and strain localization. The formulation uses equal order interpolations and, in
particular, linear/linear P1P1 elements are demonstrated (triangles in 2D and tetrahedra in 3D).
The LBB inf-sup condition on the mixed problem is effectively circumvented using the variational
multiscale method, selecting the strain and displacement subscales in the space orthogonal to the

finite element interpolating spaces, respectively.
This provides a robust formulation which shows enhanced accuracy in the strain and stress

fields when compared to the irreducible formulation and the ability to address quasi-incompressible
problems when compared to previous versions on the mixed formulation that do not incorporate
the displacement subscale. Additionally, an explicit implementation of the formulation, that does
not require the solution of coupled full systems of equations, greatly simplifies its implementation
and application.

The presented benchmark problems in 2D and 3D prove that the MEX-FEM formulation: (i)
can be extended to the quasi-incompressible elastic regime, (ii) can solve problems in the com-
pressible and quasi-incompressible plastic regime, (iii) can satisfactorily solve quasi-static material
physically problems involving strain localization, (iv) performs satisfactorily with directional in-
elastic behavior, without spurious stress locking and without the need of auxiliary discontinuity
tracking procedures.
