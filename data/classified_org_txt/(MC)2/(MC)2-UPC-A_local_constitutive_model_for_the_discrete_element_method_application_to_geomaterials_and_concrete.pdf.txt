Abstract This paper presents a local constitutive model for modelling the linear and non linear behavior of
soft and hard cohesive materials with the discrete element method (DEM). We present the results obtained in
the analysis with the DEM of cylindrical samples of cement, concrete and shale rock materials under a uniaxial
compressive strength (UCS) test, different triaxial tests, a uniaxial strain compaction (USC) test and a brazilian
tensile strength (BTS) test. DEM results compare well with the experimental values in all cases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Extensive research work on the discrete element method (DEM) has been carried out in the last decades since
the first ideas were presented by Cundall and [11]. Much of the research efforts have focused on the development
of adequate DEM models for accurately reproducing the correct behaviour of non cohesive and cohesive granular
assemblies [1, 6, 8, 11, 20, 24, 29, 42, 45–47], as well as of solid materials [13, 14, 16–18, 22, 23, 28, 31, 32, 34–
36, 42, 43]. In recent years the DEM has also been effectively applied to the study of multifracture and failure of
geomaterials (soils and rocks), concrete, masonry and ceramic materials, among others.

The analysis of solids with the DEM poses a number of difficulties for adequate reproducing the correct
constitutive behaviour of the material under linear (elastic) and non linear conditions.

Within the analysis of solids with the DEM the material is typically represented as a collection of rigid
particles (spheres in three dimensions (3D) and discs in two dimensions (2D)) interacting among themselves at
the contact interfaces in the normal and tangential directions. Material deformation is assumed to be concentrated
at the contact points. Appropriate contact laws are defined in order to obtain the desired macroscopic material
properties. The contact law can be seen as the formulation of the material model of the underlying continuum
at the microscopic level. For frictional cohesive material the contact law takes into account the cohesive bonds
between rigid particles. Cohesive bonds can be broken, thus allowing to simulate fracture of the material and its
propagation.

Fig. 1: Model of the contact interface in the DEM

A challenge in the failure analysis of solid materials, such as cement, shale rock and concrete, with the DEM
is the definition of the limit strengths in the normal and shear directions at the contact interfaces, and the
characterization of the non linear relationship between forces and displacements at these interfaces beyond the
onset of fracture, accounting for frictional effects, damage and plasticity.

In this work we present a local constitutive model for failure analysis of solid materials typical in geomechanics
and concrete applications with the DEM. The model is validated in the analysis of cement, concrete and shale
rock samples for several laboratory strength tests. The tests considered include the uniaxial compression strength
(UCS) test, triaxial compressive strength tests, the uniaxial strain compaction (USC) test and the brazilian tensile
strength (BTS) test. DEM results compare well with experimental data provided by Weatherford for the cement
and shale rock samples [19, 33] and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) for the concrete samples [37].

2 CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR THE DEM

Standard constitutive models in the DEM are typically characterized by the following parameters:

Local parameters
– Normal and shear stiffness parameters Kn and Ks.
– Normal and shear strength parameters Fn and Fs.
– Coulomb friction coefficient µ.
– Local damping coefficient Cn.

Global parameters
– Global damping coefficient for the translational motion, αt.
– Global damping coefficient for the rotational motion, αn.

Figure 1 shows an scheme of some DEM parameters for a 2D model.
The challenge in DEM models for analysis of solids is finding an objective and accurate relationship between

the DEM parameters and the standard constitutive parameters of a continuum mechanics model (hereafter called
“continuum parameters”): the Young modulus E, the Poisson ratio ν and the tension and shear failure stresses

σ
f
t and τ

f , respectively.
Two different approaches can be followed for determining the DEM constitutive parameters for a cohesive

material, namely the global approach and the local approach. In the global approach uniform global DEM properties
are assumed for each contact interface in the whole discrete element assembly. The values of the global DEM
parameters can be found via different procedures. Some authors haver derived analytical relationships between
continuum and global DEM parameters [24, 25]. Others have used numerical experiments for determining the
relationships between DEM and continuum parameters expressed in dimensionless form [14, 17, 18]. This method
has been used by the authors in previous works [21–23, 31, 34–36]. Other procedures are based on relating the
global DEM and continuum parameters via laboratory tests using inverse analysis techniques [29].

The local approach used in this work assumes that the DEM parameters depend on the local properties of
the interacting particles, namely their radii and the continuum parameters at each interaction point. Different
alternatives for defining the DEM parameters via a “local approach” have been reported in recent years [13, 14,
16, 31, 32, 42, 43]. A comparative study of several global and local approaches for estimating the DEM constitutive
parameters is presented in [36].

In this work we present a new procedure for defining the DEM parameters for a cohesive material in the
framework of the local approach. In the next section we describe how the local elastic parameters can be found.
Then we define appropriate local failure criteria at the contact interface using an elasto-damage model for the

normal tensile stress and the shear stress, and an elasto-plastic model for the normal compressive stress. The
accuracy of the local DEM constitutive model is verified in the analysis of laboratory strength tests for different
cohesive materials.

The DEM model presented here can be considered as an extension of that proposed by Donzé and co-workers
[13, 16, 38, 43]. Among the distinct features of our model we note the inclusion of the effect of the size of
the interacting spheres in the normal and shear parameters, the introduction of a parameter in the constitutive
law accounting for the number of contacts and the packaging of particles, the definition of the failure criteria,
the estimation of the limit compressive stress at the contact interface, the effect of damage and plasticity in the
evolution of the normal and shear parameters and the definition of the material parameters in terms of the uniaxial
stress-strain curve obtained from strength tests.

Clearly, the local DEM constitutive model presented in this work is also applicable to standard non-cohesive
granular material, as a particular case of the more general expressions for the cohesive case. In this sense, the model
is able to simulate the frictional behaviour of the particulate material that forms once the bonds are broken.

3 BASIC EQUATIONS

3.1 Equations of motion

The translational and rotational motion of rigid spherical or cylindrical particles is described by means of the
standard equations of rigid body dynamics. For the i-th particle we have (Figure 2)

miüi = Fi , (1)

Iiω̇i = Ti , (2)

where ui is the particle centroid displacement in a fixed (inertial) coordinate frame X, ωi – the angular velocity,
m – the particle mass, Ii – the moment of inertia, Fi – the resultant force, and Ti – the resultant moment about
the central axes. Vectors Fi and Ti are sums of: (i) all forces and moments applied to the i-th particle due to
external loads, Fexti and T

ij (Figure 3),
j = 1, · · · , nci , where n

c
i is the number of particles being in contact with the i-th particle, (iii) forces and moments

where rcij is the vector connecting the centroid of the i-th particle with the contact point c at the interface between
particles i and j (Figure 3).

The form of the rotational equation (2) holds for spheres and cylinders (in 2D) and is simplified with respect
to a general form for an arbitrary rigid body with the rotational inertial properties represented by a second order
tensor. In the general case it is more convenient to describe the rotational motion with respect to a co-rotational
frame x which is embedded at each element, since in this frame the tensor of inertia is constant.

3.2 Integration of the equations of motion

Equations (1) and (2) are integrated in time using a standard central difference scheme [31, 48]. The time integration
operator for the translational motion at the n-th time step is as follows:

üni =
Fni

The vector of incremental rotation ∆θ = [∆θx, ∆θy, ∆θz]
T is calculated for the ith particle as

∆θi = ω
n+1/2
i ∆t (10)

Knowledge of the incremental rotation suffices to update the tangential contact forces. It is also possible to track
the rotational position of particles, if necessary. Then the rotation matrices between the moving frames embedded

in the particles and the fixed global frame must be updated incrementally using an adequate multiplicative scheme
[23, 31, 48].

Explicit integration in time yields high computational efficiency and it enables the solution of large models.
The disadvantage of the explicit integration scheme is its conditional numerical stability imposing the limitation
on the time step ∆t [48], i.e.

∆t ≤ ∆tcr (11)

where ∆tcr is a critical time step determined by the highest natural frequency of the system ωmax as

∆tcr =
2

ωmax
(12)

If damping exists, the critical time increment is given by

∆tcr =
2

ωmax

(√
1 + ξ2 − ξ

)
(13)

where ξ is the fraction of the critical damping corresponding to the highest frequency ωmax. Exact calculation
of the highest frequency ωmax requires the solution of the eigenvalue problem defined for the whole system of
connected rigid particles. In an approximate solution procedure, an eigenvalue problem can be defined separately
for every rigid particle using the linearized equations of motion

miäi + kiai = 0 (14)

where
mi = {mi,mi,mi, Ii, Ii, Ii}T , ai = {(ux)i, (uy)i, (uz)i, (θx)i , (θy)i , (θz)i}T (15)

and ki is the stiffness matrix accounting for the contributions from all the interface constraints that are active for
the i-th particle.

4 FRICTIONAL CONTACT CONDITIONS

4.1 Contact interface

Let us assume that an individual particle is connected to the adjacent ones by appropriate relationships at the
contact interfaces. These relationships define either a perfectly bond or a frictional sliding situation at the interface.

Particles are assumed to be spherical and can have very different sizes. Each particle i is characterized by the
sphere radius ri. We will assume that particles i and j are in contact at a point c located at a distance (1 + β)ri
or (1 + β)rj from the centers of particles i and j, respectively (Figure 4) where β is a positive number (typically)
0 ≤ β ≤ 0.20. We define the interaction domain between the two particles that share the contact point c as a
cylinder of radius equal to the radius of the smaller of the two particles in contact. The circular section at point c
of radius rc is the contact interface between particles i and j.

This definition of the contact interface and the interaction domain is motivated by the fact that the two
interacting particles can have very different radius for an arbitrary distribution of the particle sizes. The contact
interface is thus limited by the size of the smaller of the two particles in contact.

4.2 Interaction range

The overall behaviour of a material can be reproduced by associating a simple constitutive law to each contact
interface. The interaction between spherical (in 3D) or circular (2D) particles i and j with radius ri and rj ,
respectively is defined within an interaction range. This range allows for a certain gap or an overlapping between
the particles. Then two particles will interact if

1− β ≤
dij

ri + rj
≤ 1 + β (16)

where dij is the distance between the centroids of particles i and j and β is the interaction range parameter (Figures
3 and 4). This choice is made so that the DEM can simulate materials other than simple granular materials, in

particular those which involve a matrix, as it is found for instance in concrete, cement and rock. A value of β > 0
is chosen in order to model the effect of this matrix that may glue two aggregates which are not themselves in
contact. In this manner the model can handle the presence of gaps and overlappings generated by most of the
sphere meshers. Simply, the contact search is extended using a value of β > 0 and the equilibrium position of the
contact point is then set for its initial configuration (which is not always a tangential contact of particles). This
works inwards for particle inclusions or outwards for gaps. For the problems solved in this work we have taken
β = 0.10.

From Eq.(16) we deduce

dij = (1± β)(ri + rj) (17)

where the plus and minus sign accounts for the gap and overlapping between the two particles, respectively.

4.3 Contact search algorithm

Changing contact pairs of elements during the analysis are automatically detected. The simple approach to identify
interaction pairs by checking every particle against every other one would be very inefficient, as the computational
time is proportional to n2, where n is the number of elements. In our formulation the search is performed using
a grid-based algorithm. In this case the computation time of the contact search is proportional to n lnn, which
allows us to solve large frictional contact systems involving many particles [23].

4.4 Decomposition of the contact force

Once contact between a pair of particles has been detected, the forces occurring at the contact point are calculated.
The interaction between the two interacting particles can be represented by the contact forces Fij and Fji, which
satisfy the following relation:

Fij = −Fji (18a)

Fig. 5: Decomposition of the contact force into its normal and tangential components

Fig. 6: Forces and stresses acting on a contact interface section Aij . Definition of normal and shear directions

We decompose Fij into its normal and shear components, Fijn and F
ij
s , respectively (Figure 5)

Fij = Fijn + F
ij
s = Fnn

ij + Fijs (18b)

where nij is the unit vector normal to the contact interface between particles i and j and Fn is the modulus of
the normal force at the interface. Eq.(18b) implies that the normal force lies along the line connecting the centers
of the two particles in contact and directed outwards from particle i (Figure 5).

The shear force Fijs along the shear direction (Figure 6) can be written as

Fijs = Fs1s1 + Fs2s2 (19a)

where Fs1 and Fs2 are the shear force components along the shear directions s1 and s2, and s1 and s2 are unit
vectors in these directions. Vector s1 is taken in an arbitrary direction orthogonal to the normal vector. Then
s2 = n

ij × s1.
The shear force modulus Fs is obtained as

F ijs = |F
ij
s | = (F

+ F 2s2)
1/2 (19b)

The relationship between the contact forces Fn, Fs1 and Fs2 and the particle displacements are obtained using
the local constitutive model described in the next section.

4.5 Definition of the contact law

In this work we have assumed a proportionality between the normal force at each contact interfaces and the
relative displacement and the relative velocity of the contact point. As for the shear force, this has been assumed
to be proportional to the relative sliding motion at the contact point. The proportionality coefficients have been

estimated starting from the one-dimensional stress-strain relationship for the cylindrical contact domain of Figure
4. This approach has been preferred versus the contact laws proposed by Hertz [15] and Mindlin [27] for modelling
the contact interaction between two spheres in the normal and tangential directions, respectively. These laws have
been used to model the contact force in granular material with the DEM [4, 46]. For the solids material considered
in this work, the existence of a matrix between grains (modelled via a gap distance, Eq.(16)) prevents in most
cases the direct contact between particles, which justifies the more “diffusive” contact model chosen in this work.

A comparison of different contact has shown that simple models in the DEM contact models such as that
presented here lead to equivalent and, sometimes even better, results than more sophisticated models [12].

5 LOCAL DEFINITION OF DEM ELASTIC CONSTITUTIVE PARAMETERS

5.1 Normal force parameters

The normal force Fn at the contact interface between particles i and j is obtained as

F ijn = σnĀ
ij (20)

where σn is the normal stress at the contact interface and Ā
ij is the effective area at the interface computed as

Āij = αijA
ij with Aij = πr2c (21)

Recall that rc is the radius of the smaller of the two particles interacting at the interface ij (Figure 4).
In Eq.(21) αij is a parameter that accounts for the fact that the number of contacts and the packaging of

particles are not optimal. Clearly, αij is a local parameter for the ij interface. In this work, however, we have
considered the case of spherical particles only and used a global definition of αij as

αij = α = 40
P

Nc
(22)

where Nc and P are the average number of contacts per sphere and the average porosity for the whole particle
assembly. Eq.(22) has been deduced by defining the optimal values for the number of contacts per sphere and for
the global porosity equal to 10 and 25%, respectively. Clearly α ' 1 for quasi-optimal packaging distributions, as
it is the case for the particle meshes using in the examples solved in this work.

The normal stress σn is related to the normal strain between the interacting spheres, εn, by a visco-elastic law
as

σn = Eεn + cε̇n (23)

where E is the Young modulus of the solid material.
We note that the Young modulus is assumed to be an intrinsic property of the material. As such it is typically

characterized from axial tests on cylindrical samples. Thus, the Young modulus obtained from the experimental
axial stress-strain relationship is used for defining the local normal stress-strain relationship at a macroscopic level
(23) at the contact interfaces. The same applies to the definition of the Poisson’s ratio of the material used for
defining the local shear constitutive relationship in Section 5.2.

The normal strain and the normal strain rate are defined as

εn =
un
dij

, ε̇n =
u̇n
dij

(24)

where dij is given by Eq.(17).
Substituting Eq.(24) into (23) gives

σn =
1

dij
[Eun + cu̇n] (25)

In Eqs.(24) and (25), c is a local damping coefficient per unit length and un and u̇n are the normal (relative)
displacement and the normal (relative) velocity at the contact point defined as

un = (xj − xi) · nij − dij , u̇n = (u̇j − u̇i) · nij (26)

where xi and xj are the position vectors of the centroids of particles i and j. Note that un and u̇n express the
relative (incremental) motion between the centroids of the interacting particles.

The damping coefficient c is taken as a fraction ξ of the critical damping c̄ per unit length for the system of
two rigid spherical bodies with masses mi and mj connected by a spring of stiffness Kn [23, 31], i.e.

c =

with 0 < ξ ≤ 1 and mij is the reduced mass of the contact,

(28)

In our work we have taken ξ = 0.9.
From Eqs.(20) and (25) we deduce the relationship between the normal force and normal relative motion at

the interface between particles i and j as

F ijn =
Āij

dij
(Eun + cu̇n) = Knun + Cnu̇n (29)

Substituting Eqs.(21) and (27) into (29) we find the expression of the normal stiffness and normal viscous
(damping) coefficients at the contact interface as

Kn =

E Cn =

√
mijKn (30)

Eq.(29) is assumed to hold in the elastic regime for both the normal tensile force Fnt and the normal compressive
force Fnc .

5.2 Shear force parameters

A similar approach is followed for obtaining the relationship between the shear forces and the relative tangential
displacements at each contact interface.

The shear forces in the s1 and s2 directions (Figure 6) are given by

Fs1 = τ1Ā
ij , Fs2 = τ2Ā

ij (31)

where τ1 and τ2 are the shear stresses at the contact interface. These stresses are linearly related to the shear
strains γ1 and γ2 at the interface by

τ1 = Gγ1 , τ2 = Gγ2 (32)

where G is the shear modulus.
A simple definition of the shear strains is

γ1 =
us1
dij

, γ2 =
us2
dij

(33)

where us1 and us2 are the components in the s1 and s2 directions of the relative tangential displacement vector
at the contact point given by (Figure 6)

uijs = [us1 , us2 ]
T = uij − (uij · nij)nij (34a)

with
uij =

(
∆ui + (ωωωωωωωωωωωωωωi × rci)∆t

)
−
(
∆uj + (ωωωωωωωωωωωωωωj × rcj )∆t

)
(34b)

where ∆ui and ∆uj are the displacement increments of the centroids of particles i and j, respectively (Eq.(7))
and rci and rcj are the vectors connecting the particle centers with the contact point (Figure 5).

Substituting Eqs.(32) and (33) into (31) we find

Fs1 = Ks1us1 and Fs2 = Ks2us2 (35)

with

Ks1 = Ks2 = Ks =

2(1 + ν)
(36)



10 E. Oñate, F. Zárate, J. Miquel, M. Santasusana, M.A. Celigueta, F. Arrufat, R. Gandikota, K. Valiullin, L. Ring

where ν is the Poisson ratio.
From Eqs.(35) we can obtain a relationship between the modulus of the shear force and the modulus of the

shear displacement vector as
Fs = Ksus (37)

with
Fs = |Fijs | =

]1/2

, us = |uijs | =
[

2 + (us2)

(38)

The sign of Fsk (k = 1, 2) in Eqs.(35) depends on the sign of the velocity component usk , while in Eq.(37) only
the modulus of vectors Fijs and u

ij
s are involved.

For convenience the upper indices i, j are omitted hereonwards in the expression of the normal and shear force
vectors Fijn and F

ij
s at a contact interface.

6 GLOBAL BACKGROUND DAMPING FORCE

A quasi-static state of equilibrium for the assembly of particles can be achieved by application of an adequate
global damping to all particles. This damping adds to the local one introduced at the contact interface (Section
5.1). We have considered the following non-viscous type global damping terms

F

t|Fexti + F

u̇i
|u̇i|

(39)

T
damp
i = −α

r|Ti|

(40)

The definition of the translational and rotational damping parameters αt and αr is a topic of research. A
practical alternative is to define αt and αr as a fraction of the stiffness parameters Kn and Ks, respectively. In
our work we have taken αt = αr = 0.1. Alternative a viscous type damping can be used, as described in [23, 31].

7 ELASTO-DAMAGE MODEL FOR TENSION AND SHEAR FORCES

7.1 Normal and shear failure

In this model, cohesive bonds at a contact interface are assumed to start breaking when the interface strength is
exceeded in the normal direction by the tensile contact force, or in the tangential direction by the shear force. The
uncoupled failure (decohesion) criterion for the normal and tangential directions at the contact interface between
particles i and j is written as

Fnt ≥ Fnt , Fs ≥ Fs (41)

where Fnt and Fs are the interface strengths for pure tension and shear-compression conditions, respectively, Fnt
is the normal tensile force and Fs is the modulus of the shear force vector defined in Eq.(38).

The interface strengths are defined as

Fnt = σ
f
t Ā

ij , Fs = τf Āij + µ1|Fnc | (42)

where σ
f
t and τ

f are the tensile and shear failure stresses, respectively (also called tensile and shear strengths), Fnc
is the compressive normal force at the contact interface and µ1 = tanφ1 is a (static) friction parameter, where φ1 is
an internal friction angle. These values are assumed to be an intrinsic property of the material and are determined
experimentally. In our work σ

f
t is taken as the tensile strength of the material measured in a bending-tensile (BT)

test (i.e. σ
f
t = (σ

f
t )BT ). The value of σ

f
t can also be obtained from the failure stresses in a Brazilian Tensile

Strength (BTS) test using the relationship between the tensile strength in BTS and BT tests. For the examples

presented in this paper we have accepted that σtf = (σ
f
t )BT = 1.60(σ

f
t )BTS [2, 5].

In absence of values from specific tensile strength tests the tensile strength σ
f
t can also be estimated from the

maximum compressive stress, (σfnc)UCS, in a uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) test in a cylindrical sample. A
typical relationship for concrete, used in this work, is

σ
f
t = 0.464

[
(σfnc)UCS

]2/3
(43)



A local constitutive model for the discrete element method. Application to geomaterials and concrete 11

There is a big discrepancy in the literature for the value of the shear strength τf for frictional cohesive materials.
In our work we have estimated the value of τf as a percentage of the maximum compressive stress in an UCS test,
(σfnc)UCS , as

τf = β(σfnc)UCS (44)

where β is a parameter that is calibrated in numerical experiments via UCS and BTS tests. In our numerical
experiments for cement, concrete and shale rock materials the value of β used has ranged from 0.4 < β < 0.55.
The corresponding value of τf is in agreement with the experimental results of Talbot [41] and Anderson et al.
[3] for estimating the shear strength of cement and concrete materials more than are century ago, as well as with
more recent experimental data for concrete and rocks [9, 10, 39, 40, 44].

Following tension failure, the constitutive behavior in the shear direction is governed by the standard Coulomb
law

Fs = µ2|Fnc |
us
|us|

with µ2 = tanφ2 (45)

where µ2 is a dynamic Coulomb friction coefficient and φ2 is the post-failure internal friction angle. Both µ2 and
φ2 are determined from experimental tests.

Figure 7a shows the graphical representation of the failure criterium described by Eqs.(41), (42) and (45). This
criterium assumes that the tension and shear forces contribute to the failure of the contact interface in a decoupled
manner. On the other hand, shear failure under normal compressive forces follows a failure line that is a function
of the shear failure stress, the compression force and the internal friction angle.

Indeed, a coupled failure model in the tension-shear zone can also be used, as shown in Figure 7b. For the
numerical tests presented in the paper the uncoupled model has been used.

Figure 8 shows the evolution of the normal tension force Fnt and the shear force Fs at a contact interface until
failure in terms of the relative normal and tangential displacements. The effect of damage in the two constitutive
laws is also shown in the figure. The method for introducing damage in the constitutive equations is explained in
the next section.

7.2 Damage evolution law

Elastic damage under tensile and shear conditions has been taken into account in this work by assuming a linear
softening behaviour defined by the softening moduli Hn and Ht introduced into the force-displacement relationships
in the normal (tensile) and shear directions, respectively (Figure 8).

measure of the loss of mechanical strength at each contact interface. For the undamaged state dn = 0 and ds = 0,
while for a damaged state 0 < dn ≤ 1 and 0 < ds ≤ 1.

Damage effects are assumed to start when the strength failure conditions (41) are satisfied. The evolution of
the damage parameters from the value zero to one can be defined in a number of ways using fracture mechanics
arguments. A key issue is that the area under the line defining the force (relative) displacement relationship in the
damaged region (the shadowed area in Figure 8) equals the specific fracture energy of the material [26, 30, 31].

8 ELASTO-PLASTIC MODEL FOR COMPRESSION FORCES

The compressive stress-strain behaviour in the normal direction at the contact interface for frictional cohesive
materials, such as cement, rock and concrete, is typically governed by an initial elastic law followed by a non-linear
constitutive equation that varies for each material. The compressive normal stress increases under linear elastic
conditions until it reaches the limit normal compressive stress σlnc (also called yield stress). This is defined as the
axial stress level where the experimental curve relating the axial stress and the axial strain starts to deviate from
the linear elastic behaviour. After this point the material is assumed to yield under elastic-plastic conditions.

The elasto-plastic relationships in the normal compressive direction are defined as

Loading path

dFnc = KTndun (52a)

Unloading path
dFnc = Kn0dun (52b)

In Eqs.(52) dFnc and dun are respectively the increment of the normal compressive force and the normal
(relative) displacement, Kn0 is the initial (elastic) compressive stiffness for a value of E = E0 (Figure 10), and
KTn is the tangent compressive stiffness given by

KTn =
ET
E0

Kn0 (53)

where ET is the slope of the normal stress-strain curve in the elastoplastic branch (i.e. KT = E1, E2, E3 in Figure
10).

Plasticity effects in the normal compressive direction also affect the evolution of the tangential forces at the
interface, as the interface shear strength is related to the normal compression force by Eq.(42).

Figure 10 shows the diagram relating the compressive axial stress and the compressive axial strain used for
modelling the elasto-plastic constitutive behaviour at the contact interfaces. The form of each diagram is typically
obtained from experimental tests on cylindrical samples with the adjustment explained in the next section.

The diagram in Figure 10 will be used for modelling with the DEM the tests in cement, concrete and shale
rock material in this work.

9 LIMIT COMPRESSIVE STRESS AT THE CONTACT INTERFACE. EXPERIMENTAL
ADJUSTMENT

The limit compressive stress at the contact interface is obtained by correcting the experimental value of the limit
compressive stress obtained in a UCS test. The correction is needed for taking into account the micro-macro
relationship that relates the limit normal stress at the contact interfaces with the limit compressive stress obtained
from experimental tests.

Figure 11 shows the average values of the ratio r =
σlnc
σla

at all the contact interfaces in terms of the angle that

the normal vector to the interface forms with the horizontal axis for different triaxial tests on cement samples.
In the expression of r, σlnc is the limit normal compressive stress at the contact interface and σ

l
a is the limit

compressive stress obtained in a UCS test. The results displayed in Figures 14 show that the values of r range
form 0.55–0.65 for UCS and triaxial tests.

The conclusion of this study is that the limit normal compressive stress at the contact interface, σlnc , is a
proportion of the actual limit compressive stress in a experimental test. In our work we have computed σlnc as
σlnc = 0.6.(σ

l
nc

)UCS , where (σ
l
nc

)UCS is the yield stress obtained in a UCS test.

10 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

The DEM model presented in the previous sections has been implemented in the DEMPACK code (www.cimne.com/
dempack), based on routines from the open-source object-oriented software platform KRATOS (www.cimne.com/
kratos) and the pre-postprocessing system GiD (www.gidhome.com). DEMPACK is a fully parallelized DEM code.
Table 1 shows the computer times and speed-ups for the analysis of a UCS test with a DEM mesh of 70000 spheres
and 1000 time steps using different processors in a Intel Xeon ES-2670 machine (2×8 = cores) using OpenMP and
MPI parallel computing strategies. Typically, the MPI strategy provided a better speed up in all cases. Note that
the problem was solved in some 56 seconds using 16 processors. Indeed, this speed can be improved by enhancing
the parallel computing features of the code.

10.1 DEM analysis of laboratory tests on cement samples

10.1.1 UCS and triaxial tests on cement samples

The experimental procedure for the triaxial tests on cement samples studied in this work is as follows:

Fig. 12: Uniaxial strain compaction test in cement sample [19]. Normal total compressive stress-axial strain rela-
tionship

1. A right cylindrical plug is cut from the sample core and its ends ground parallel each other within 0.001 inch.
Physical dimensions and weight of the specimen are recorded. The dimensions of the cylindrical samples are 1
inch diameter and 2 inches height. The specimen is tested under saturated condition with water.

2. The specimen is then placed between two endcaps and a heat-shrink jacket is placed over the specimen.
3. Axial strain and radial strain devices are mounted in the endcaps and on the lateral surface of the specimen,

respectively.
4. The specimen assembly is placed into the pressure vessel and the pressure vessel is filled with hydraulic oil.
5. Confining pressure is increased to the desired hydrostatic testing pressure.
6. Specimen assembly is brought into the contact with a loading piston that allows application of axial load.
7. Increase axial load at a constant rate until the specimen fails or axial strain reaches a desired amount of strain

while confining pressure is held constant.
8. Reduce axial stress to the initial hydrostatic condition after sample fails or reaches a desired axial strain.
9. Reduce confining pressure to zero and disassemble sample.

The simulation of a triaxial test with the DEM reproduces the experiment as follows.

a) The confining pressure is applied up to the desired hydrostatic testing pressure.
b) A prescribed axial motion is applied at the top of the specimen until this fail, or the axial compressive strain

strain reaches a desired amount of strain while confining pressure is held constant.

For the UCS test the process starts by step (b) above described with zero confinement pressure.
We note that the goal of this study was to reproduce with the DEM model presented the structural behaviour

of the sample during the axial compression phase. For this purpose an average Young modulus (deduced from the
uniaxial strain compaction (USC) test) was chosen for modelling the the hydrostatic compaction of the sample
during the application of the confining pressure. A more detailed study of the non linear behaviour of the cement
sample under an hydrostatic load will be presented in a subsequent work.

Figure 12 shows the normal stress-strain relationship for a cement material as deduced from the USC test
presented in [19]. The curve shows an initial elastic branch and a (elasto-plastic) hardening branch.

Figure 13 shows the so-called “differential stress” computed as the difference between the applied axial stress
and the confinement pressure during the USC test for the same cement material [19]. The curve shows the initial
linear elastic part, a limit axial stress of around 10 Mpa and the subsequent non linear branch. The non linear
region has a flat part which indicates the compaction of the cement material for that stress level. This is followed
by a hardening branch which evidences the recovery of the material stiffness for high compaction values.

For completeness, Figure 14 shows the evolution of confinement pressure during the USC test. We note that
the curve in Figure 13 is the difference between the curves of Figures 12 and 14.

The stress in the curve in Figure 13 coincides with the effective stress only if we accept that the water pressure
in the pores is the same as the external pressure required to enforce the uniaxial strain conditions during the test.

In our work we have used the stress-strain curve obtained in the USC test as the basis for computing the
normal compressive force at the contact interfaces (σa) for the cement material examples. Note that for saturated
conditions this curve already accounts for the effect of water pressure at the pores.

Table 4: DEM constitutive parameters for triaxial tests on cement samples

Table 3 shows the DEM constitutive parameters for the UCS, USC and BTS tests corresponding to the values
defined in Figure 10. Table 4 lists the DEM constitutive parameters for triaxial tests.

The confining pressure is directly applied to the spheres that lay on the surface of the specimen. A normal
force is applied to each surface particle in the radial direction. The magnitude of the force has been approximated
in this work as Fni = πr

2
i pc where ri is the particle radius and pc is the confining pressure. A more accurate

procedure for transferring the confining pressure to the spheres at the boundary of the specimen using the areas
of the Voronoi polygon created by the centroids of the spheres is presented in [7].

A small confining pressure of 70 psi was applied for the analysis of the UCS test. This pressure reproduces the
effect of the heat-shrink jacket on the lateral deformation of the sample.

Figures 15 and 16 show DEM results for the UCS and triaxial tests for a discretization of 42000 spheres.

Figure 15 shows DEM results of the applied axial versus the axial strain in the cement specimen for the UCS
test. Figures 16 show DEM results for triaxial tests in the cement samples for confining pressures of 500, 1000,
2000 and 4000 psi using again 42000 spheres. Good correlation between the DEM results and the experimental
values [19] is obtained in all cases.

Figure 17 shows the deformation of the sample at the failure point for the UCS test where the typical cracking
pattern can be seen. A similar set of results is shown in Figure 18 for the triaxial test under a confining pressure
of 500 psi and different deformation levels.

10.1.2 Uniaxial strain compaction (USC) test on cement sample

For the USC test the radial strain is constrained in the sample while a piston presses the sample from the top.
The DEM parameters are those given in Tables 2 and 3.

Again, excellent agreement between DEM and experimental results is obtained using 16000 spheres (Figure
19).

10.1.3 Brasilian tensile strength (BTS) test on cement sample

The BTS test was carried out for a sample of 1.487in diameter and 0.863in thickness. The density of the material
was 1.70g/cm3. The experimental value of the maximum load in the BTS test was 847 lb which corresponds to a

value of (σ
f
t )BTS = 420 psi ≈2.9 MPa. Hence, σ

f
t = 1.6(σ

f
t )BTS = 4.8 Mpa (Section 7.1).

The DEM parameters used are given in Tables 2 and 3.

The DEM analysis was carried out using a discretization of 16000 spheres. The stress-displacement curve
obtained with the DEM is displayed in Figure 20. The maximum tensile strength computed is 3.0 MPa. The
agreement with the experimental value of 2.9MPa is within 3.5% of relative error.

Figure 21 shows the x-displacement field on the sample once it has broken.

10.2 DEM analysis of laboratory tests on concrete samples

The experimental tests were carried out at the laboratories of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in
Barcelona, Spain. Details of the test are given in [37]. The concrete used in the experimental study was designed to
have a characteristic compressive strength of between 32.8 and 38 MPa at 28 days. Standard cylindrical specimens
(of 150 mm diameter and 300 mm height) were cast in metal molds and demolded after 24 hours for storage in a
fog room.

The triaxial tests were prepared with a 3-mm-thick butyl sleeve placed around the cylinder and an impermeable
neoprene sleeve fitted over it. Before placing the sleeves, two pairs of strain gages were glued on the surface of the

specimen at mid-height. Steel loading platens were placed at the flat ends of the specimen and the sleeves were
tightened over them with metal scraps to avoid the ingress of oil.

The tests were performed using a servo-hydraulic testing machine with a compressive load capacity of 4.5 MN
and a pressure capacity of 140 MPa. The axial load from the testing machine is transmitted to the specimen by
a piston that passes through the top of the cell. Several levels of confining pressure ranging from 1.5 MPa to 60
MPa were used in order to study the brittle-ductile transition of the response. First the prescribed hydrostatic
pressure was applied in the cell, and then the axial compressive load was increased at a constant displacement
rate of 0.0006 mm/s.

Two specimens were tested at each confining pressure, and all tests were performed at ages of more than 50
days to minimize the effect of aging response. In addition to the triaxial tests, uniaxial compression tests were also
performed.

Concrete samples were tested in dry conditions. For our computations the limit compressive normal stress was
estimated as the stress level of the axial stress-deformation curve where elasto-plastic behaviour initiates in the
UCS test [37] (Figure 22) and taking into account the correction mentioned in Section 9. This gives σlnc = 15 Mpa.

On the other hand, the value of σ
f
t was estimated using Eq.(43) for a value of (σ

f
nc

)UCS = 37 MPa. This gives

σ
f
t ' 5 MPa. As for τf we have taken τf = 0.45(σfnf )UCS ' 16 MPa.

The DEM constitutive parameters for the analysis of the concrete samples are shown in Table 5. Figures 22
and 23 respectively show DEM results for the UCS and triaxial tests for confining pressures of 4.5, 9.0 and 60
MPa using a discretization of 13000 spheres. Results for the BTS test are shown in Figure 24. Good agreement
with the experimental results [37] was found in all cases.

The effect of plasticity for different unloading-reloading paths is accurately predicted with the DEM using just
4000 spheres.

10.3 UCS and BTS tests on shale rock material

We have simulated with the DEM code a UCS test and a BTS test on a shale rock material corresponding to a
Middle Brown gaseous shale in Devonian formation from Lincoln County, West Virginia. The essential material
parameters for the DEM simulations were taken from [33].

The simulations were carried out in a cylindrical sample of dimensions 150× 300 mm. The material properties
used for the DEM analysis are listed in Table 6. The value of τf = 25 MPa was obtained using Eq.(44) with
β = 0.5 and (σfnf )UCS = 50 MPa as reported in [33].

The curve in Figure 26 shows the axial stress-axial strain curve for the UCS test. A maximum compressive stress
of 48 MPa was obtained using a discretization of 37000 spheres. This yields a 4% error versus the experimental
value of 50 MPa [33].

The curve in Figure 27 shows the tensile stress - versus time for the BTS test obtained with the DEM using
27000 spheres. A failure tensile stress of σ

f
t = 5.4 MPa was obtained. This gives a 8% error versus the experimental

value of σ
f
t = 5 MPa.

11 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have presented a local constitutive model for the DEM. The model governs the linear and non linear rela-
tionships between the normal and tangential forces and the corresponding relative displacements at the contact
interfaces between discrete particles. The good behaviour of the model has been verified in its application to the

compare well with experimental data for the same tests.

The results obtained in this work show that the DEM model presented yields an accurate and reliable numerical
method for linear and nonlinear analysis of geomaterials and concrete under mechanical loading.

Further validation of the DEM model presented is still needed in order to asses its convergence features for the
non linear analysis of cohesive material in terms of the number and size distribution of the spheres.
