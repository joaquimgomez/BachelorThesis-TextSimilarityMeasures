ABSTRACT (150 to 250 words) 
 

The damping modification factors are utilized to alter the design spectral ordinates for constructions 

whose damping differs significantly from 5%, this being the level that is routinely considered by most 

codes. Such factors are habitually evaluated after suites of historical inputs representing the local 

seismicity. However, such records may not be readily available, due either to moderate seismicity or to 

limited seismological network; in such cases, representative artificial accelerograms might be used 

instead. This paper proposes a methodology for establishing damping modification factors after 

artificial inputs generated to match the 5% design spectra; this approach can be used for countries, 

regions or cities. The proposed methodology is based on performing dynamic analyses on 

underdamped and overdamped SDOF linear systems by using the aforementioned selected 

accelerograms. Although previous studies have highlighted the differences among factors generated 

after natural and artificial inputs, it has been observed that such discrepancies are mainly due to the 

longest significant (Trifunac) duration of the artificial accelerograms. Therefore, the artificial inputs 

are generated as their duration fits those of the available local strong motion records. An application to 

Colombia is presented; the results are compared with those for some available Colombian records. The 

sensitivity of the calculated factors to the soil type, period and seismic zone is investigated; matching 

expressions are provided. Such expressions are compared with the prescriptions of major design codes 

and with other studies. The suitability of the proposed formulation is further verified in an example on 

an isolated hospital building.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

A considerable number of seismic regulations merely provide design spectra corresponding to 5% 

damping. This damping level can be adequate for most of highly-damaged ordinary buildings and for 

some bridges, but the behavior of numerous other constructions is better described with significantly 

different damping ratios. Relevant examples of lower damping are: modern high-tech high-rise steel 

buildings, towers, masts, chimneys, racking systems, most of bridges (mainly the steel ones), steel 

warehouses, steel tanks, silos, arch and gravity dams, nuclear power plants, industrial facilities and 

buildings, pipelines, underground structures in rock or stiff soil, higher vibration modes of buildings 

with base isolation, and virtually all the undamaged constructions (i.e. assessment of damage 

limitation state in performance-based seismic engineering), among other cases. Regarding higher 

damping, there is also a considerable number of situations: old masonry buildings, timber 

constructions, most historic buildings, short bridges founded on soft soil, embankments, earth dams, 

underground structures in soft soil, buildings or bridges with base isolation, and buildings equipped 

with additional dampers, among other cases. Also, the substitute structure concept [Gulkan, Sozen 

1974; Shibata, Sozen 1976], the Direct Displacement-based Design approach [Priestley 2003] and the 

Capacity Spectrum Method [ATC-40 1996], require the consideration of high damping over long 

period ranges. In this wide range of cases, considerable variations of the damping ratio are observed, 

ranging approximately between 0.5% and 30%, or higher. Using 5% damping spectra for constructions 

with different damping ratios can lead to important errors. If the damping ratio is less than 5%, the 

error lies on the unsafe side. In the opposite situation, the error is on the safe side; nonetheless, in base 

isolated constructions and in buildings with energy dissipators, the higher damping cannot be ignored,

given that is an essential part of the design. To sum up, it is strongly necessary to have seismic design 

spectra corresponding to a wide range of damping ratios. 

 

Numerous seismic regulations provide criteria to modify the 5% damping spectral ordinates in order to 

match other damping levels; such criteria are commonly expressed in terms of damping modification 

factors intended to multiply the spectral ordinates. Some codes [EN-1998 2004; BSL 2009; GB 50011 

2010; NCH 2745 2013] propose expressions or tables for modification factors to be considered for any 

other damping ratios. Conversely, the American regulations [ASCE 7-10 2010; FEMA P-1050 2016] 

provide modification factors that are intended only for buildings with base isolation or additional 

dampers; therefore, such coefficients can be solely employed for damping ratios higher than 5%. 

These correction coefficients have been derived [Ramírez et al. 2001; Ramírez et al. 2002] after 

seismic inputs recorded in the USA; the study [Sáez et al. 2012] for Chile [NCh2745 2013] has shown 

significant discrepancies with the American regulations [Piscal, López Almansa 2016; Piscal A. 

2018]. Although these discrepancies can be partly explained by the varying assumptions, they rely 

mainly on the particularities of the seismicity of each country. These considerations show that the 

criteria for modifying the 5% design spectrum derived for a specific country cannot be extrapolated to 

other areas. Consequently, both this paragraph and the previous one highlight that there is a strong 

need for developing damping modification factors in countries where they are not currently available. 

 

The damping modification factors are normally derived after strong historical seismic records that 

characterize the local seismicity. However, in numerous occasions this approach is unfeasible, given 

that the number of such records that are readily available is insufficient; this usually occurs when the 

seismicity is moderate (or medium) and the seismological network is limited. For such cases, two 

types of approaches have been proposed: using representative artificial accelerograms to compensate 

the scarcity of actual inputs, and retrieving real accelerograms from a database and modifying them to 

match the target spectrum. The second approach seems adequate for particular studies (i.e. for a given 

structure); conversely, in any general study, the spectral ordinates should be modified for the whole 

range of periods, this being rather unfeasible. In the framework of the first approach, this paper 

proposes a methodology for establishing damping modification factors (for countries, regions or cities) 

after artificial seismic inputs. 

 

The proposed methodology starts by generating artificial accelerograms that are the fitted to the 5% 

damped code design spectra. Then, dynamic analyses on SDOF linear systems using such inputs are 

carried out. Finally, for a given damping ratio, the damping modification factor is defined as the ratio 

between the individual displacement spectral ordinates corresponding to such damping ratio and to 

5%. For the sake of further reliability, the obtained factors are compared with those derived after the 

available local historical accelerograms. Perhaps the main objection to this approach is that previous 

researches [Bommer et al. 2005; Stafford et al. 2008; Hatzigeorgiou 2010] have underlined the 

differences among factors generated after natural and artificial inputs. However, such discrepancies 

are mainly due to the usual longest significant (Trifunac [Trifunac, Brady 1975]) duration of the 

artificial accelerograms. Therefore, in the proposed methodology, the artificial inputs are generated 

caring that their duration approximates those of the available local records. In any case, even if the 

consideration of artificial inputs may introduce some errors, they will be significantly smaller than 

using damping modification factors derived for foreign seismic conditions. 

 

An example of application of the proposed strategy to Colombia is presented. In such application, the 

country is divided into ten seismic zones according to the current design code [NSR-10 2010], and the 

five most common soil types (A, B, C, D and E) are considered. Given the rather moderate seismicity 

of Colombia and the limitations and recentness of the seismological network, the available natural 

severe inputs are scarce. On the other hand, there is not enough information for selecting international 

records representing the Colombian hazard, such as moment magnitude and hypocentral distance. As 

well, as discussed in the previous paragraph, it is not possible to find records that can be scaled to the 

design spectra for the full range of periods. Therefore, for each zone and soil type, groups of seven 

artificial accelerograms fitting the design spectra for 5% damping are generated. The results obtained 

with these artificial inputs are compared with those for some available historical accelerograms

recorded in Colombia. The sensitivity of the calculated modification factors to the soil type, period 

and seismic zone is investigated, and matching expressions are generated; such equations are intended 

to be incorporated into the Colombian regulations. These expressions are compared with previous 

researches and with the prescriptions of major worldwide design codes; a reasonable fit is observed. 

Finally, a verification example on a hospital building with seismic isolation and located in Cali 

(Colombia) is presented and discussed. This example further endorses the proposed approach, since 

their results are satisfactorily compared with those using the historical records that were employed in 

the seismic microzonation of Cali. 

 

2 DAMPING MODIFICATION FACTORS 
 

2.1 Concept of design spectrum 
 

The design spectra, although routinely considered for structures described with MDOF models, are 

derived for linear SDOF systems. The horizontal axis represents the system natural period; the vertical 

axis displays either displacement, energy (in terms of equivalent velocity) or acceleration. For a given 

location, the code design spectra are smoothed envelopes of the individual spectra corresponding to a 

representative suite of accelerograms. The linear equation of motion of a SDOF system under seismic 

excitation can be written as: 

 

𝑚 �̈� + 𝑐 �̇� + 𝑘 𝑥 = −𝑚 �̈�g (1) 

 

In equation (1), m, c and k are mass, damping and stiffness coefficients, xg is the input soil 

displacement, and x is the output relative displacement, being linked to the absolute displacement (y) 

by the kinematic relation x = y  xg. The system is mainly characterized by its undamped natural 

frequency ( = √
𝑘

𝑚
) and damping ratio ( =

𝑐

2 √𝑘 𝑚
). The solution of equation (1) is

. The 

following three response spectra are defined: 

 

𝑆d(, 𝑇) = |𝑥(, 𝑇)|max 𝑆v(, 𝑇) = |�̇�(, 𝑇)|max 𝑆a(, 𝑇) = |�̈�(, 𝑇)|max (5) 
 

Sd, Sv and Sa, are termed as relative displacement, relative velocity, and absolute acceleration response 

spectra, respectively. By neglecting the difference between the integrals with sinus and cosinus and 

assuming that  is small, in equation (3) |�̇�|max ≈  ω |𝑥|max. Analogously, in equation (4) |�̈�|max ≈

 ω2 |𝑥|max. Thus, the pseudo-velocity (PSv) and pseudo-acceleration (PSa) response spectra are 
proposed as: 

 

𝑃𝑆v(, 𝑇) = ω 𝑆d(, 𝑇) 𝑃𝑆a(, 𝑇) = ω
2 𝑆d(, 𝑇) (6) 

 

In force-based design, PSa is the most meaningful, since provides the equivalent static forces that 

generate the same maximum relative displacement than the accelerogram; thus, reports on structural 

damage. The design codes contain a smoothed envelope of the corresponding individual spectra, 

commonly termed as “response acceleration design spectrum”, despite being actually a pseudo-



4 

 

acceleration spectrum. Sa represents the maximum absolute acceleration, thus reporting on non-

structural damage. In displacement-based design [Priestly et al. 2007], displacement spectra (Sd) are 

considered. These considerations hold even if  is not small. Indeed, if  is high, the only relevant 

change is that PSa and Sa might differ significantly. 

 

For multi-story base isolated buildings, [Kelly 1999] shows that excessive additional damping reduces 

the displacement at the isolation layer, but at the expense of increasing floor accelerations and 

interstory drifts in the superstructure. This consideration further emphasizes the need of considering 

not only Sd, but also Sa. Noticeably, this circumstance cannot be completely derived after the spectra, 

since they merely correspond to SDOF systems. 

 

2.2 State-of-the-art of research on damping modification factors 
 

A considerable number of studies on the derivation of damping modification factors have been 

published; only the researches that have most influenced this work are reported herein [Lin, Chang 

2003, 2004; Atkinson, Pierre 2004; Lin et al. 2005; Bommer, Mendis 2005; Cameron, Green 2007; 

Stafford et al. 2008; Casarotti et al. 2009; Cardone et al. 2009; Hatzigeorgiou 2010; Hao et al. 2011; 

Sheikh et al. 2013; Rezeian et al. 2014; Bradley 2015; Mollaioli et al. 2014; Mavroeidis 2015; 

Benahmed et al. 2016; Pu et al. 2016; Palermo et al. 2016]. These works examine the influence of a 

number of issues: fundamental period of the construction, input duration, distance from the site to the 

hypocenter, magnitude of the earthquake, soil type, forward-directivity effect (near-fault), among 

others. The following general remarks spring from these studies: 

 

 Period. For zero period, the stiffness is infinite; therefore, the relative displacement (x) is null, and 
the absolute acceleration (�̈�) equals the one of the ground. Since both verifications hold for any 

damping value, it is obvious that the damping modification factors for Sd and Sa are equal to 1 for 

T = 0. At the other end of the spectrum, if T approaches infinite while the damping ratio is 

maintained constant, the stiffness (k) and damping (c) coefficients approach zero; therefore, the 

system becomes totally uncoupled from the ground, thus, the relative displacement equals minus 

the one of the ground, and the absolute acceleration is null. Given that both verifications hold 

regardless of damping, the damping modification factors for Sd and Sa, also tend to 1 when T tends 

to infinity. In the short periods range, the damping modification factors become rather extreme, 

that is, greater/smaller for damping ratios smaller/greater than 5%. Then, for periods ranging 

approximately between 0.25 s and 1 s, both factors tend to stabilize. Finally, for longer periods, 

the damping effect decreases slowly but consistently; as discussed previously, the damping 

modification factors approach one as the period tends to infinity.  

 Input duration. Differences among response spectra for different damping levels should be 
greatest for long-lasting excitations, since have more time to develop stationary response, and, 

thus, fully undergo the damping effect. In other words, the longer the input, the more complete the 

damping effect. Therefore, the damping modification factors should be significantly more extreme 

for prolonged accelerograms. [Stafford et al. 2008] shows that the Trifunac duration [Trifunac, 

Brady 1975] is better correlated to such factors than the number of cycles. 

 Hypocentral distance. For a given earthquake, apart from local effects, the duration of the inputs 
grows with the distance between the location and the hypocenter. Thus, as concluded in the 

previous paragraph, the damping effect increases consistently as that distance grows; hence, the 

damping modification factor tends to be more extreme.  

 Earthquake magnitude. Given that events with higher moment magnitude tend to generate 
records lasting longer, the damping effect is expected to increase accordingly, as concluded when 

discussing the influence of the input duration. However, this trend is well-established only for 

periods greater than approximately 0.5 s; for shorter periods this tendency can be inverted. 

 Soil type. Regarding the influence of soil type, two opposite trends collide: in rock and stiff soil 
the soil damping is rather low and, therefore, the role of the structural damping is more relevant, 

but the inputs tend to be shorter. In softer soils, the opposite happens. As a result, the balance is 

unclear.  



 C.M. Piscal A.,  F. López-Almansa 5 

 

  

 Near-fault effects. For pulse-like records, the damping modification factor is, in general, slightly 
closer to 1 (i.e. less extreme) than for ordinary inputs. This circumstance can be explained by the 

short duration of such inputs and, more specifically, by the shorter duration of the pulses, being 

their most destructive part. However, this trend can be inverted for periods close to the pulse 

period, given that the paramount importance of damping in the response peak. 

 

These remarks highlight the need of considering the influence of period, input duration (and indirectly, 

hypocentral distance and earthquake magnitude), soil type and near-fault effects in the derivation of 

damping modification factors for any area.  

 

2.3  Existing methodologies for determining damping modification factors for a given area 
 

All the proposed methodologies are based on calculating, through time-history analyses, the effects of 

damping on the maximum displacement response of SDOF systems subjected to recorded 

accelerograms or, less frequently, to artificial ones. Then, the damping modification factor is defined 

as the ratio between the spectral ordinates (either PSa or Sd) for the considered value of damping and 

for 5% damping (Sd(,T) / Sd(0.05,T)). A number of papers [Lin et al. 2005; Cardone et al. 2009; 

Casarotti et al. 2009; Sheikh et al. 2013] describe comprehensibly the state-of-the-art, including the 

earliest studies; in view of that, this subsection discusses only the latest researches.  

 

 Sáez et al. 2012. Among other contributions, this study proposes, for Chile, an empirical 
expression of damping reduction factor for different spectral ordinates. This equation is similar to 

the one proposed in [Lin, Chang 2004], being dependent on period and damping ratio. This 

expression has been derived after linear dynamic analyses on SDOF systems under 28 scaled 

Chilean seismic records; these inputs are grouped into hard, intermediate and soft soil. The used 

scaling procedure is described in [Kottke, Rathje 2008]. The influence of the earthquake type 

(inter-plate and intra-plate), soil type, and duration of motion is discussed. The obtained factor has 

been proposed for implementation in the Chilean design code [NCh2745 2013]. 

 Anbazhagan et al. 2016. This work proposes, for the Himalayan Region, damping reduction 
factors for pseudo-acceleration spectra obtained after local inputs. The main output is an empirical 

equation for the damping reduction factor in terms of period, moment magnitude, hypocentral 

distance, and site classification. The authors state that, although the influence of the input duration 

is significant, it is indirectly represented by the other considered parameters. 

 Mendo, Fernandez-Dávila 2017. Among other contributions, this study proposes a slight 
modification, for Peru, of the empirical expression of damping reduction factor originally 

proposed for Chile [Sáez et al. 2012; NCh 2745 2013]. This expression depends on period and 

damping ratio, and has been derived after linear dynamic analyses on SDOF systems under 14 

two-component Peruvian seismic records; these inputs are grouped into rock and intermediate soil. 

The obtained factors are in between those of [ASCE 7-10 2010] and [NCh2745 2013]. 

 

3 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING DAMPING MODIFICATION 
FACTORS 

 

The proposed methodology is based on [Sáez et al. 2012]. That research provides damping 

modification factors for Chilean buildings equipped with energy dissipators; in this work, such 

approach is extended to any construction with damping ratios differing from 5%. As well, a 

methodology to compensate the lack of sufficient seismic information is designed. 

 

This work considers two modification factors (termed as Ba and Bd) intended to multiply the 

corresponding 5% damping design spectrum; Ba and Bd are generated from acceleration and 

displacement (or pseudo-acceleration) response spectra, respectively:  

 

𝐵a(, 𝑇) =
𝑆a(, 𝑇)

𝑆a(0.05, 𝑇)
 𝐵d(, 𝑇) =

𝑆d(, 𝑇)

𝑆d(0.05, 𝑇)
=

𝑃𝑆a(, 𝑇)

𝑃𝑆a(0.05, 𝑇)
 (7)

After the discussion in subsection  2.1, it follows that Ba factor is meant to be used for Sa spectra, thus 

reporting on non-structural damage. Noticeably, such spectra are not readily available in the design 

codes; moreover, equation (4) shows that, for high damping ratios and short periods, differences 

between Sa and PSa can be considerable. Regarding Bd factor, is meant for both Sd and PSa spectra, thus 

reporting on structural damage. Concerning Bv factor (derived after velocity spectra), it is not 

considered highly meaningful, since Sv does not represent adequately neither input nor hysteretic 

energy spectra in terms of equivalent velocity [Benavent Climent et al. 2002, 2010; López Almansa et 

al. 2013]. 

 

The most recent studies for determining damping modification factors for a given country or region 

have been carried out for Taiwan [Lin 2007], Chile [Sáez et al. 2012], the Himalayan region 

[Anbazhagan et al. 2016] and Perú [Mendo, Fernandez-Dávila 2017]. Some of these investigations 

have been conducted after scaled accelerograms obtained from locally-recorded actual ground 

motions. Although this strategy is considered basically correct, it requires a wide set of registers that 

represent the actual seismicity; if locally-recorded accelerograms are to be used, it is limited to zones 

with high seismicity (to ensure a sufficient number of strong ground motions), with deeply-studied 

tectonic mechanisms, and holding a dense, long-standing and reliable seismological network. In 

developing countries or in areas with moderate or medium seismicity, these conditions are not 

commonly fulfilled; this work investigates whether the lack of available historical accelerograms can 

be partly compensated with artificial inputs that are generated to fit the code design spectra. The 

proposed approach consists in deriving the damping modification factors after a combination of 

natural and artificial accelerograms. If the artificial inputs are generated for all the design spectra that 

correspond to each soil type and seismic zone that are specified in the code, they will easily become 

more numerous and representative than the available historical accelerograms; therefore, the proposed 

strategy consists in deriving initially the damping modification factors after the artificial 

accelerograms, and then comparing with the recorded ones for further verification and refining. 

 

This strategy releases, to some extent, the need of taking into consideration the magnitude of the 

earthquake and the hypocentral distance, since these issues are implicitly incorporated in the design 

spectra for each seismic zone the country is divided in. Conversely, the research [Stafford et al. 2008] 

has pointed out that the differences between the numbers of cycles of recorded and artificial 

accelerograms might lead to significant discrepancies among the damping modification factors derived 

after them; therefore, the generation of duration-compatible artificial inputs needs to be seriously taken 

this consideration.  

 

Noticeably, the proposed strategy is considered particularly suitable for determination of damping 

modification factors for relatively small and highly populated urban areas where microzonation studies 

have been carried out, given that typically only few records are readily available.  

 

4 STUDY FOR COLOMBIA 
 

4.1 General description 
 

Given the aforementioned scarcity of seismic records in Colombia, the study is mainly based on 

artificial inputs. Initially, fifty groups of seven artificial accelerograms are generated; each group 

corresponds to a given seismic zone in Colombia (ten zones, [NSR-10 2010]) and a given soil type 

(five types, A through E, [NSR-10 2010]). The inputs are created to match the 5% damping design 

response acceleration spectra for the corresponding seismic zone and soil type. For each accelerogram, 

linear dynamic analyses are conducted on SDOF systems; their natural period (T) and damping ratio 

() range between 0.01 and 4 s, and 0.005 (0.5%) and 0.5 (50%), respectively. In each case (for a 

given seismic zone, soil type, and damping ratio) the seven obtained pairs of individual Sd and Sa 

spectra are averaged. Then, the modification factors Bd and Ba are defined as indicated in equation (7). 

The obtained results are compared with the most relevant available accelerograms recorded in 

Colombia.  

 



 C.M. Piscal A.,  F. López-Almansa 7 

 

  

Nineteen values of damping ratio ranging between 0.005 and 0.5 are considered: 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 

0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04, 0.045, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45 and 0.5. Regarding 

the period, 3990 values are taken, ranging from 0.01 and 4 s. Therefore, for the artificial inputs, the 

number of conducted dynamic analyses is: 10 (zones)  5 (soil types)  7 (accelerograms)  19 

(damping ratios)  3990 (natural periods) = 26,533,500. As well, additional analyses are performed to 

provide sounder basis for the derived conclusions; among them, calculations for damping ratios in the 

range between 0.5 and 0.8. 

 

In each dynamic analysis, the solution of equation (1) is obtained as indicated in equations (2) through 

(4); the involved Duhamel integrals are solved numerically by assuming linear interpolation of 

acceleration. For systems with natural period longer than 0.04 s, the time step is 0.01 s; for systems 

with shorter periods, the time step is selected as T / 4. 

 

4.2 Design spectra for Colombia 
 

As discussed in the previous subsection, the Colombian code [NSR-10 2010] divides the country in 

ten seismic zones, being numbered as 1 (lowest seismicity) through 10 (highest seismicity). Regarding 

the soil classification, it follows basically the American regulation [ASCE 7-10 2010]; six categories 

are considered, ranging from A (hard rock, average shear wave velocity higher or equal than 1500 

m/s) through F. Given that soil type F routinely requires particular studies, and that no design spectra 

are provided in the code, only types A through E (average shear wave velocity lower than 180 m/s) are 

considered in this study. Fifty design spectra are generated, corresponding to the ten seismic zones and 

the five major soil types. 

 

The seismic zones are classified with respect to the parameter Aa, which represents the design PGA 

(spectral ordinate zero-period) in soil type A [NSR-10 2010]. The site seismicity is also characterized 

by the parameter Av, which affects the medium and long period ranges of the spectrum; noticeably, the 

divisions of the country in seismic zones according to both parameters are not always coincident. Each 

zone is represented by a city having maximum values of Aa and Av. Table 1 describes the main 

characteristics of the considered zones. Table 1 highlights the extreme discrepancies among the zones, 

ranging from low seismicity in zone 1 to high one in zone 10. 

 

The spectra are generated by assuming that the importance 

(I) and response modification (R) factors are equal to one. 

The obtained spectral ordinates are intended to multiply the 

building seismic weight to provide the base shear force; such 

ordinates are termed Sa in the Colombian code, although they 

actually correspond to PSa (pseudo-acceleration spectra). 

Each spectrum is composed of three branches: constant 

acceleration (short periods), constant velocity (intermediate 

periods) and constant displacement (long periods); the 

boundaries between these intervals are termed TC and TL, 

respectively. Table 2 displays the values of TC and TL for 

each zone and soil type.

Figure 1 displays the pseudo-acceleration design spectra for each seismic zone and soil type. Figure 

1.a through Figure 1.e contain sets of ten spectra (for each zone) corresponding to soils A through E, 

respectively. For the sake of further comparison, Figure 1.f presents, for zone 10, five spectra 

corresponding to each soil type, respectively. Figure 1.f shows that the softest soil (type E) does not 

always hold the highest spectral ordinates for the whole range of periods. Noticeably, the Colombian 

design spectra contain also an inclined initial branch; such segment is not included here, given that it is 

only intended for spectral analyses for the higher modes.

Figure 1. Design spectra in the Colombian design code [NSR-10 2010] 

 

The plots from Figure 1.a through Figure 1.e show that, for each soil type, the spectra for the ten zones 

are approximately homothetic, namely vertically scaled with the Aa coefficient (Table 1). Therefore, 

given that the artificial inputs are generated to fit these spectra, the inputs for the ten zones that 

correspond to a given soil type will be also approximately homothetic; therefore, since the damping 



 C.M. Piscal A.,  F. López-Almansa 9 

 

  

modification factors are obtained after linear analyses, no big differences among the ten zones are to 

be expected.  

 

4.3 Artificial seismic inputs 
 

As discussed in section  1, fifty groups of artificial accelerograms are created; each group has seven 

accelerograms. These groups correspond to the ten seismic zones in Colombia (110) and the five soil 

types (AE) that have been considered. The number of accelerograms inside each group has been set 

as seven, as indicated by [ASCE 7-10 2010; ASCE 7-16 2016] for base-isolated buildings. The 

accelerograms are created to match the 5% damping acceleration design response spectrum by using 

the SeismoArtif software [Seismosoft 2016]. The inputs are generated for 20 s duration, as their Trifunac 

duration [Trifunac, Brady 1975] matches those of the available local records (section  5). The variation of 
amplitude vs. time responds to the random function described in [Saragoni, Hart 1973], by selecting that the 

maximum amplitude corresponds to 4 s and the final instant amplitude is 5% of the maximum one. The 

choice of the function in [Saragoni, Hart 1973] is based on its superior capacity to reproduce the behavior 

of actual inputs; the parameters are selected by accounting for the aforementioned high sensitivity of the 

damping modification factor to the input duration. The quadratic error and coefficient of variation 

(averaged for the 350 accelerograms) are 8.70% and 0.0997, respectively; the discretization period is 

0.01 s. Figure 2.a displays an example of a sample accelerogram whose response spectrum fits the design 

spectrum of the Colombian code [Piscal A. 2018]; Figure 2.b presents comparison among such design 

spectrum and those of the seven corresponding artificial accelerograms (one of them is displayed in Figure 

2.a).

Figure 2.b highlights the great similarity between the target code design spectrum and the individual 

response spectra of the generated artificial accelerograms. 

 

4.4 Obtained results 
 

Figure 3 displays sample spectra for factors Bd (Figure 3.a) and Ba (Figure 3.b); the selected case 

corresponds to Zone 7, soil type A and damping 30%. Each figure presents seven plots of Bd or Ba vs. 

period corresponding to seven individual accelerograms, and their average spectrum; noticeably, 

apparently, only 6 individual spectra can be observed because two of them are almost coincident. 

Figure 3 shows that the dispersion of the seven spectra that correspond to the same design spectrum 

(i.e. same seismic zone and soil type) is rather moderate.

The observation of the results averaged for each group (of seven accelerograms) shows little influence 

of the seismic zone (subsection  4.2) [Piscal A. 2018], this being coherent with the complexity of the 

tectonics of Colombia; therefore, the values of Bd and Ba are averaged for the ten zones. Thus, Figure 4 

displays plots of factors Bd vs. period for each soil type and some representative values of the damping 

ratio (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30); Figure 4.a through Figure 4.e contain plots of 

Bd for the soil types A through E, respectively. The observation of these plots shows also little 

influence of the soil type. Hence, Figure 4.f presents plots of Bd averaged for all the soil types. Figure 

5 displays similar plots of the factor Ba.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show regular behavior, with results fitting basically the previous studies 

(subsection  2.2). Noticeably, for short periods and low damping, the dispersion is high. 

 

4.5 Derived expressions for Bd and Ba factors 
 

This subsection describes the genesis of the recommended fitting expressions for Bd and Ba factors. 

These relations are derived to match the plots in Figure 4.f and Figure 5.f, respectively. The starting 

points are the criteria provided for Bd and Ba in [Lin, Chang 2004]. For Bd, this work considers the 

expression 𝐵d = 1 −
𝑎 𝑇𝑏 

(𝑇+1)𝑐
, where the coefficient a contains the influence of damping and 

 𝑇𝑏 

(𝑇+1)𝑐
 

represents the effect of period; the selected values and expressions are b = 0.3, c = 0.65 and a = 1.3033 

+ 0.436 ln . For Ba, 𝐵a = 𝑑 + 𝑒 𝑇; for T > 0.2 s, d = 0.342 
0.354

 and e = 0.0186 + 0.368 (  1) / 



 C.M. Piscal A.,  F. López-Almansa 13 

 

  

10.644 
2
, and for T < 0.2 s, a linear interpolation starting from Ba = 1 for T = 0 s (subsection  2.2), is 

suggested. The investigation [Lin, Chang 2004] refers only to damping ratios greater than 5%; 

conversely, the spectra in Figure 4.f and Figure 5.f include also damping ratios smaller than 5%. The 

derivation of the matching expressions is described next for both cases. 

 

Damping ratio higher than 5%. For Bd, the same expression proposed in [Lin, Chang 2004] (𝐵d =

1 −
𝑎 𝑇𝑏 

(𝑇+1)𝑐
) is considered. The process starts by selecting the values of the coefficients a, b and c that 

better fit the spectra in Figure 4.f for damping ratio 30%; this operation is performed by nonlinear 

regression using the damped least-squares (Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm implemented in Gnuplot 

[Williams, Kelley 2011]. For damping ratios 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 25%, 20%, 15% and 10%, the 

values of coefficients b and c are kept constant, while a is obtained with the same algorithm. For Ba, a 

trilinear fit is suggested; the coefficients of each linear segment (𝐵a = 𝑑 + 𝑒 𝑇) are determined by 
linear regression. Table 3 displays the obtained values of the coefficients a, b and c (Bd) and d and e 

(Ba).

Damping ratio lower than 5%. For both Bd and Ba, the same expression proposed in [Lin, Chang 

2004] for Bd (𝐵d = 1 −
𝑎 𝑇𝑏 

(𝑇+1)𝑐
) is considered. For Bd, the process starts by selecting the values of the 

coefficients a, b and c that better fit the spectra in Figure 4.f for damping ratio 4%; this operation is 

performed by nonlinear regression using the damped least-squares (Levenberg-Marquardt) algorithm 

implemented in Gnuplot [Williams, Kelley 2011]. For damping ratios 5%, 3%, 2.5%, 2%, 1.5%, 1% 

and 0.5% the coefficient b remains constant, while a and c are obtained with the same algorithm. For 

Ba, the process is analogous, although none coefficient remains constant for any damping ratio. Table 

4 displays the obtained values of the coefficients a, b and c.

5 COMPARISON WITH ACTUAL COLOMBIAN ACCELEROGRAMS 
 

5.1 Initial considerations 

 

This section presents a comparison among the results obtained in the previous section (after artificial 

accelerograms) with results derived from some available Colombian natural inputs. 

 

5.2 Recorded inputs in Colombia 
 

A number of historical accelerograms recorded in Colombia have been selected; the selection criteria 

are: local magnitude greater or equal than 6.0, and epicentral distance less than 210 km. This 

information has been retrieved from the Colombian Seismological National Network [RSNC 2017]; 

noticeably, the soil type is taken from [Benavent-Climent et al. 2010]. The time step is 0.005 s. For the 

baseline correction, a constant polynomial is used; then, a 4
th
 order Butterworth filter with a bandpass 

configuration (0.1-20 Hz) is employed. Given that most of the available relevant records correspond to 

the zone 5, this study is constrained to that area. Table 6 displays the main characteristics of the 

selected historical records. The hypocentral distance corresponds to the straight separation between the 

hypocenter and the recording station. IA is the Arias Intensity [Arias 1970] given by 𝐼A =
π

2 g
∫ �̈�g

2 𝑑𝑡, 

where �̈�g is the input ground acceleration; IA is an estimator of the input severity. The Trifunac 

duration is defined as the time elapsed between the 5% and the 95% of the Arias Intensity [Trifunac, 

Brady 1975]. The Housner intensity [Housner 1952] is defined as the area enclosed, between 0.1 and 

2.5 s, by the 5% damping elastic pseudo-spectral velocity spectrum.

For the sake of comparison with the historical inputs in Table 6, Table 7 displays the average 

parameters of the suites of seven artificial inputs (subsection  4.3) that correspond to the same seismic 

zone and soil type. Table 7 shows that the available historical records are significantly less severe than 

the corresponding artificial ones, except for the four strongest records of the Armenia earthquake 

(Table 6, Córdoba 1999/01/25 event). Regarding the Trifunac duration [Trifunac, Brady 1975], Table 

6 shows that, for such four inputs, it is equal to 11.06, 9.54, 14.32 and 10.13 s; comparison with the 

values in Table 7 shows a rather satisfactory agreement.

5.3 Comparison between spectra from artificial and natural accelerograms 
 

Figure 7 displays comparisons among 30%-damped Bd spectra obtained after natural and artificial 

inputs. Figure 7.a, Figure 7.b and Figure 7.c correspond to soil A, C and D, respectively; each Figure 

contains three types of plots: those corresponding to the strongest components of the individual 

records listed in Table 6, their average, and the average of the spectra derived after the artificial inputs 

that belong to the same seismic zone, damping level (30%) and soil type. Figure 7.d presents a similar 

comparison referring to the average spectra for soils A, C and D. Figure 7.d. also contains three types 

of plots: individual for all the records in Table 6, their average, and the corresponding fitted expression 

that is displayed in Table 3.

Figure 7. Comparison between Bd spectra for artificial and historical accelerograms in zone 5 for damping 30% 

 

The plots from Figure 7 show a reasonably satisfactory agreement between the spectra generated from 

recorded and artificial inputs, given the extreme scarcity and high dispersion exhibited by the Bd 

spectra for the historical accelerograms. Noticeably, to assess the relevance of the observed 



18 

 

discrepancies between the spectra generated after both types of accelerograms, it should be kept on 

mind that the available historical inputs are too scarce to be considered representative of the actual 

seismicity of Colombia. 

 

6 COMPARISON WITH FACTORS DEFINED IN CODES AND IN THE LITERATURE  
 

This section compares the main output of this study (i.e. the matching expression for the Bd that is 

factor presented in Table 3) with previous proposals, either from reported studies or from design 

codes. Figure 8 displays a comparison among the expression derived in this study for Bd, and the 

results of previous researches [Lin 2004; Sáez 2012] and of the codes of Chile [NCh 2745 2013], 

Japan [BSLEO 2009], USA [ASCE 7/10 2010], Europe [EN-1998 2005] and China [GB50011 2010]. 

Figure 8.a, Figure 8.b, Figure 8.c, and Figure 8.d present Bd spectra for 30%, 20% 10% and 2% 

damping ratio, respectively.

Figure 8. Comparison among Bd code spectra with the results of this and previous studies 

 

The plots from Figure 8 show that the results of this study fit reasonably well those of the previous 

researches [Lin 2004; Sáez 2012]. Regarding the design codes, the derived expression lies within their 

range; noticeably, the analyzed codes show an important scattering.  

 

The current Colombian design code [NSR-10 2010] does not contain any criteria to modify the 5%-

damped spectra; for seismic isolation, the USA regulations [ASCE 7/10 2010] are used instead. Figure 

8 shows relevant disagreements between that criterion and the results of this study. Such differences 

can be due to the fact that the US accelerograms have shorter duration and are rather pulse-like [Sáez 

et al. 2012]. In any case, for the ranges of periods and damping ratios of interest in seismic isolation 

(period between 2.5 and 3.5 s, and damping ratio between 20% and 30%), Figure 8.a and Figure 8.b 

show that the discrepancies are significantly smaller. 

 

It is worth noting that the Japanese, European and Chinese codes do not allow further reduction of the 

spectral ordinates for damping ratios higher than 30%; analogously, in the USA and Chilean 

regulations, such bound is 50%. This study corroborates this strategy, since, for damping ratios

exceeding approximately 50%, Ba factor can be greater than 1, thus generating an increase of the 

absolute accelerations [Piscal A. 2018]. 

 

7 VERIFICATION EXAMPLE 
 

This section discusses an application example on a 4-story RC base-isolated hospital building located 

in Cali (Colombia) [Piscal, López Almansa 2016]. This study aims to verify the accuracy of the 

proposed approach by comparing the maximum design displacement of the isolation layer (DD) 

determined with three different approaches: (i) equivalent lateral forces method [ASCE 7-10 2010], 

(ii) the same method, although considering the derived Bd factor instead, (iii) nonlinear time-history 

analysis using 7 actual records that had been utilized in the microzonation of Cali [Decreto 158 2014]. 

A more extended description of this study is available in [Piscal A. 2018]. 

 

The building is the 4-story “Clínica Confandi”, being the first base-isolated hospital in Colombia. It 

has a RC framed structure. The plan is rectangular, with sides 50.4 and 17 m, and the seismic weight is 

35021 kN. The foundation soil belongs to zone 4D according to the Cali microzonation [Decreto 158 

2014], being equivalent to soil D [NSR-10 2010]. A deeper description of this building can be found 

in [Piscal, López Almansa 2016]. 

 

The isolation layer consists of 32 bearings; two types of isolator units are employed: natural rubber 

bearings (NRB) and lead-rubber bearings (LRB). Three isolation solutions have been investigated; 

they differ in the characteristics of the isolators and the target values of the fundamental period and the 

damping ratio of the isolated building. Table 8 displays the main features of the three analyzed 

solutions.

, where T 

is the fundamental period of the isolated building in the direction under consideration, Sa is the spectral 

ordinate corresponding to this period, and B is the reduction factor due to damping. Sa is determined 

after the corresponding design spectra in the Cali microzonation [Decreto 158 2014], and B = 1.40, 

1.49 and 1.70 for solutions 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In the second approach, 1 / B is represented by the 

derived coefficient Bd (Table 3 and Table 5); Bd = 0.662, 0.658 and 0.543 for solutions 1, 2 and 3, 

respectively. 

 

In the third (time-history) approach, seven historical accelerograms that were considered in the Cali 

microzonation [Decreto 158 2014] have been selected. Such inputs were recorded in rock; thus, they 

have been scaled [Kottke, Rathje 2008] to correspond to soil D and to match the aforementioned 

design spectrum for Cali. This scaling follows the guidelines of the Colombian regulation [NSR-10 

2010]. 

 

Table 9 displays the maximum displacements in the isolation layer corresponding to the three analyzed 

isolation solutions (Table 8) and the three aforementioned analysis approaches.

Table 9 shows that the proposed formulation (third column) provides better agreement with the 

allegedly more exact dynamic results (last column) than the formulation contained in the American 

regulations [ASCE 7-10 2010] (second column). This can be read as a verification of a better 

suitability of the proposed formulation to the particular Colombian conditions. 

 

8 CONCLUSIONS 
 

This study proposes a strategy to derive damping modification factors after linear dynamic analyses by 

using artificial inputs that are generated to match the 5%-damped code design response spectra of the 

area under consideration. Given the sensitivity of such modification factors to the significant 

(Trifunac) duration, the considered artificial inputs are generated caring that this duration does not 

exceed significantly the one of the available local records. This approach is intended for any country, 

region or city where a sufficient number of representative seismic records is not readily accessible. 

The derived expressions are aimed to modify 5%-damped displacement (or pseudo-acceleration) and 

acceleration response spectra according to the actual value of the damping ratio of the analyzed 

construction; values both higher and smaller than 5% are considered. 

 

The obtained expressions depend on the period; conversely, the influence of the soil type and the site 

seismicity is less relevant, being neglected in this study. The proposed modification factor for 

acceleration response spectra is greater than one for long periods and damping ratios higher than 

approximately 50%; this circumstance corroborates that, in buildings with base isolation, overdamping 

can lead to serious nonstructural damage. 

 

An application example of the proposed strategy to Colombia is presented; expressions for scaling 

displacement and acceleration spectra are obtained. Such expressions match reasonably well those of 

the most relevant previous studies. The derived expressions are compared with other major seismic 

regulations, being concluded that lie within their range; noticeably, such codes show important 

scattering. The results obtained with these artificial inputs are compared with those for some available 

historical accelerograms recorded in Colombia; the agreement is rather satisfactory, accounting that 

such actual inputs are too scarce to represent the actual seismicity. Concerning seismic isolation, the 

current Colombian code refers to the USA regulations; although there are relevant discrepancies with 

the results of this study, the differences are only moderate for the ranges of period and damping of 

interest. The suitability of the proposed formulation to the Colombian situation is further analyzed in a 

verification example of a base-isolated hospital building; comparison with results derived after time-

history analyses using actual inputs shows better agreement than using the US regulations. 

 

The satisfactory performance of the derived expressions shows that artificial accelerograms can be a 

convenient option to estimate the damping modification factor in countries without enough actual 

seismic records, like Colombia.
