Abstract

Aiming for the modeling of localized failure in quasi-brittle solids, this paper addresses a thermodynamically

consistent plastic-damage framework and the corresponding strain localization analysis. A unified elastoplastic dam-

age model is first presented based on two alternative kinematic decompositions assuming infinitesimal deformations,

with the evolution laws of involved internal variables characterized by a dissipative flow tensor. For the strong (or

regularized) discontinuity to form in such inelastic quasi-brittle solids and to evolve eventually into a fully softened

one, a novel strain localization analysis is then suggested. A kinematic constraint more demanding than the classical

discontinuous bifurcation condition is derived by accounting for the traction continuity and the loading/unloading

states consistent with the kinematics of a strong (or regularized) discontinuity. More specifically, the strain jumps

characterized by Maxwell’s kinematic condition have to be completely inelastic (energy dissipative). Reproduction of

this kinematics implies vanishing of the aforesaid dissipative flow tensorial components in the directions orthogonal

to the discontinuity orientation. This property allows naturally developing a localized plastic-damage model for the

discontinuity (band), with its orientation and the traction-based failure criterion consistently determined a posteriori

from the given stress-based counterpart. The general results are then particularized to the 2D conditions of plane stress

and plane strain. It is found that in the case of plane stress, strain localization into a strong (or regularized) disconti-

nuity can occur at the onset of strain softening. Contrariwise, owing to an extra kinematic constraint, in the condition

of plane strain some continuous inelastic deformations and substantial re-orientation of principal strain directions in

general have to take place in the softening regime prior to strain localization. The classical Rankine, Mohr-Coulomb,

von Mises (J2) and Drucker-Prager criteria are analyzed as illustrative examples. In particular, both the closed-form

solutions for the discontinuity angles validated by numerical simulations and the corresponding traction-based failure

criteria are obtained.

1. Introduction

The onset of macroscopic failure in solids and structures is often signified by highly localized deformations (i.e.,

strain localization) within bands of small (or even fracture surfaces of negligible) width compared to the length scale of

the structure in consideration. Typical examples of the manifestation of strain localization include cracks in concrete,

joints in rocks, shear bands in soils, dislocations and slip lines in metals, etc., owing to the overall softening responses

of these solids. It is of utmost significance to resolve strain localization and the resulting localized failure while

evaluating the residual capacity and preventing the potential catastrophic collapse of structures.

Ever since the pioneering work of Ngo and Scordelis (1967) and Rashid (1968) a large number of different ap-

proaches have been developed for the modeling of localized failure in quasi-brittle solids. These approaches range

from the classical discrete and smeared crack models (Rots, 1988), to the more advanced strong discontinuity ap-

proaches (Hansbo and Hansbo, 2004; Oliver, 1996; Simó et al., 1993; Wells and Sluys, 2001; Wu et al., 2015; Wu

and Li, 2015). Restricting the focus to the continuum context, existing formulations can be classified into stress-

based (generalized) continuum models or traction-based nonlinear fracture models. In the stress-based family the

strain/displacement discontinuities upon strain localization are smoothed or smeared. Accordingly, the overall non-

linear behavior of the weakened solid can be described by tensorial constitutive relations in terms of stress versus

strain equipped with internal variables. Plasticity (Chaboche, 2008; Chen, 1994) and damage mechanics (Krajci-

novic, 2003; Lemaitre, 1996) or their combination (Armero and Oller, 2000; Ibrahimbegovic, 2009; Ju, 1989; Ortiz,

1985; Voyiadjis and Dorgan, 2007; Voyiadjis and Kattan, 1992; Wu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2010) are frequently em-

ployed to develop appropriate inelastic constitutive laws; see Abu Al-Rub and Darabi (2012); Ibrahimbegovic et al.

(2008) and the references therein. To guarantee objectivity of the energy dissipation during the failure process, the

softening regime is in general regularized by introducing the fracture energy and an appropriately identified length

scale (Bažant and Oh, 1983). Comparatively, in the traction-based approaches strain/displacement jumps are explic-

itly accounted for by embedding the discontinuities into a solid matrix along preferred orientations. It is in general

assumed that energy dissipation is localized into the discontinuities while the bulk remains elastic, between which the

traction continuity condition is imposed. Depending on the recoverable/irreversible properties of the discontinuities,

vectorial traction-based cohesive zone models of either plastic (Carol et al., 1997), damage (Armero, 1999; Jirásek and

Zimmermann, 2001) or combined plastic-damage (Wu, 2011; Wu and Xu, 2011) type can be established. Similarly,

the softening law for the discontinuities is also characterized by the fracture energy.

In the traction-based modeling of localized failure in solids, a crucial step is to determine the discontinuity orien-

tation consistently and fix it appropriately, if required. This is a non-trivial task for a new or propagating discontinuity

whose orientation is not pre-defined or known a priori. For strain or weak discontinuities, the discontinuous bifurca-

tion analysis, pioneered by Hill (1958, 1962), Thomas (1961) and Rice (Borré and Maier, 1989; Rice and Rudnicki,

1980; Rudnicki and Rice, 1975), nowadays becomes the standard tool. Based on the assumption of linear comparison

solid (inelastic loading state in both the bulk and localization band) and the traction continuity condition, necessary

conditions for the discontinuous bifurcation were identified and the orientation of shear bands can be determined for

plastic materials; see the monograph (Lubarda, 2002) and the articles (Jirásek and Rolshoven, 2009; Runesson et al.,

1991; Svedberg and Runesson, 1997; Voyiadjis et al., 2005; Vrech and Etse, 2005) among many others. Recently,

Sánchez et al. (2008) and Huespe et al. (2009, 2012) successfully applied this strategy to the modeling of ductile

fracture in presence of the stress triaxiality (Besson et al., 2003; Remmers et al., 2013).

For strong (displacement) discontinuities, similar arguments were also followed. For instance, Simó et al. (1993)

and Oliver (1996) suggested using the discontinuous bifurcation condition together with null softening modulus to de-

termine the discontinuity orientation. However, its application to quasi-brittle solids might be questionable, since the

actual deformation states upon strain localization, i.e., inelastic loading inside the discontinuity (band) and unloading

elastically outside it, are inconsistent with the assumption of linear comparison solids. Consequently, except for some

particular cases (e.g., the Rankine and plane strain von Mises models), the strong discontinuity condition (Oliver et

al., 1998; Oliver et al, 1999; Oliver, 2000) cannot be satisfied in general cases (Oliver et al, 1999). Some kinematic

mismatches are observed (Oliver et al., 2006, 2012) due to mis-prediction of the discontinuity orientation, inevitably

resulting in stress locking (Cervera et al., 2012; Mosler, 2005). This fact partially explains the overwhelming popu-

larity of the maximum tensile stress criterion or linear fracture mechanics based ones (Dumstorff and Meschke, 2007)

in the numerical modeling of localized failure in brittle and quasi-brittle solids (Wu et al., 2015; Wu and Li, 2015).

Provided the discontinuity orientation is determined, a cohesive zone model is generally introduced to characterize

the discontinuity, resulting in either the strong/regularized or embedded/smeared discontinuity models; see Cervera

and Wu (2015) for the conformity between these traction-based approaches. However, on the one hand, it is difficult

to identify the traction-based failure criterion and involved parameters from available experimental data. On the other

hand, the questions whether and when the traction-based cohesive zone model should be introduced cannot be easily

identified. Therefore, it would be rather advantageous, if the traction-based failure criterion is derived consistently

from a stress-based one and the right instant for introducing the cohesive zone model can be also identified. In this

aspect, Oliver and coworkers (Oliver et al., 1998; Oliver et al, 1999; Oliver, 2000; Oliver et al., 2002, 2006) made great

contributions and derived cohesive zone models by projecting inelastic material laws onto the discontinuity. However,

only the classical isotropic damage model (Oliver, 2000; Oliver et al., 2002, 2006), the Rankine and plane strain von

Mises plasticity models (Oliver et al., 1998; Oliver et al, 1999) are considered. More general material constitutive

laws cannot be sufficiently accounted for as declared in Oliver et al (1999): “Obtaining such explicit forms of the

discrete constitutive equations is not so straight-forward for other families of elastoplastic models”.

Noticing the above facts, Cervera et al. (2012) proposed directly using the strong discontinuity condition (Oliver

et al., 1998; Oliver et al, 1999; Oliver, 2000) to determine the discontinuity orientation, so that the stress locking-

free property can be guaranteed for a fully softened discontinuity. The discontinuity orientation for von Mises (J2)

plasticity model so obtained were validated by numerical simulations in the cases of plane stress and plane strain.

Recently, the authors (Wu and Cervera, 2013, 2014a,b, 2015) successfully extended this method to a stress-based

plastic-damage model with general failure criteria. Not only the discontinuity orientation but also the traction-based

cohesive zone model are determined consistently from a given stress-based inelastic material model. Furthermore, the

bi-directional connections and in particular, the equivalence conditions, between two complementary methodologies

for the modeling of localized failure in quasi-brittle solids, i.e., traction-based discontinuities localized in an elastic

bulk and strain localization of a stress-based inelastic softening solid, have also been established. However, all

our previous work assumes implicitly or explicitly that only relative rigid body motions occur at both sides of the

discontinuity (band) upon strain localization. This restrictive kinematics implies continuous bulk strains across the

discontinuity (Wu, 2011). Though the discontinuous bulk strains seldom dominate strain localization in quasi-brittle

solids (Oliver et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2015), the resulting stress continuity might be too restrictive in some cases.

Moreover, the aforementioned analyses were mainly intended for the plane stress condition, and the exceptional cases

which preclude occurrence of a strong (or regularized) discontinuity were not considered.

The aim of this paper is to make further contributions to the above topics. The novelties are threefold: (i) The

Maxwell’s kinematic condition for guaranteeing the occurrence of a strong discontinuity is derived from the trac-

tion continuity condition together with the consistent loading/unloading deformation states upon strain localization

in quasi-brittle solids; in particular, the assumption of continuous stresses across the discontinuity is disregarded;

(ii) Closed-form results in both plane stress and plane strain conditions, coincident with those given by numerical

simulations (Cervera et al., 2015), are obtained, and the consequences of an additional out-of-plane constraint in

the latter case are identified; (iii) The aforesaid exceptional case in which the strong discontinuity is precluded for a

given stress-based failure criterion is solved by introducing necessary modifications based on the equivalence between

traction- and stress-based approaches established before (Wu and Cervera, 2015). For simplicity only infinitesimal

deformations are considered and the possible extension to the finite deformation setting is to be explored later.

This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, a unified elastoplastic damage framework is presented

in Section 2 based on the irreversible thermodynamics with internal variables. Section 3 addresses the Maxwell’s

kinematic constraint upon strain localization in quasi-brittle solids and its application to the above elastoplastic dam-

age model. Closed-form results in 2D conditions of plane stress and plane strain are given in Section 4, together with

several classical failure criteria analyzed as illustrative examples. The most relevant conclusions are drawn in Section

5. For the sake of completeness, three appendices are attached to close this paper.

Notation. Compact tensor notation is used in this paper as far as possible. As a general rule, scalars are denoted

by italic light-face Greek or Latin letters (e.g. a or �); vectors and second-order tensors are signified by italic boldface

minuscule and majuscule letters like a and A, respectively. Fourth-order tensors are identified by blackboard-bold

majuscule characters (e.g. A). Symbols I and I represent the second-order and symmetric fourth-order identity

tensors, respectively. Superscripts ‘T’ and ‘sym’ indicate the transposition and symmetrization operations, respectively.

The inner products with single and double contractions are denoted by ‘�’ and ‘:’, respectively. The dyadic product

2. A unified elastoplastic damage framework

Coupled plastic-damage models have been widely adopted to describe stiffness degradation and plastic strains of

materials; see Armero and Oller (2000); Ibrahimbegovic et al. (2008); Ju (1989); Ortiz (1985); Voyiadjis and Kattan

(1992); Zhu et al. (2010) among many others and the large volume of references in the texts (Ibrahimbegovic, 2009;

Krajcinovic, 2003). In this section a unified elastoplastic damage framework (Meschke et al., 1998; Wu and Xu,

2011) is presented based on the irreversible thermodynamics with internal variables (Horstemeyer and Bammann,

2010). Both stress- and traction-based elastoplastic damage models can be developed within this framework.

2.1. Stress–strain relations

Confining the discussion to a purely mechanical theory, the second law of thermodynamics (local form) requires

that for any admissible deformation process, the energy dissipation rate PD has to be non-negative, i.e.,

PD WD � W P� � P � 0 (2.1)

where � and � denote the second-order stress and strain tensors, respectively; P./ represents the rate with respect to

the (pseudo-) time;  is the Helmholtz free energy density function of the material, which is an important concept for

deriving a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model (Lemaitre, 1996).

As usual in the case of isothermal and infinitesimal deformations, it is assumed that the Helmholtz free energy

density function  admits an uncoupled form (Armero and Oller, 2000; Ju, 1989). To account for both stiffness

degradation and irreversible deformations, the free energy density function  is postulated as

 D  ed.� � �p;E/C �.�/ (2.2)

where the stored energy function  ed.� � �p;E/ characterizes the elastic and damage responses of the solid in terms

of the recoverable strain tensor � � �p and the variable stiffness tensor E, with �p being the irreversible plastic strain

tensor; the potential function �.�/ models the inelastic (damage and plastic) responses in terms of a generic internal

variable �. For the material with linear unloading/reloading responses, the stored strain energy density function

 ed.�; �/ is expressed as a quadratic form, i.e.,

 ed D

�
� � �

(2.3)

Note that the stiffness tensor E (or, equivalently, the compliance C D E�1), the plastic strain tensor �p and the

strain-like variable � are all internal variables. Therefore, their evolution laws have to be postulated.

Substitution of the definitions (2.2) and (2.3) into the energy dissipation inequality (2.1) yields

As will be clear later from Eq. (2.13), the dissipative strain tensor rate P�dis, closely related to the energy dissipation rate

PD , does not correspond to an actual “strain”; it is only defined in rate form when the involved dissipative mechanisms,

i.e., damage evolution and plastic flows, are active.

As shown in Fig. 2, the strain tensor � and the rate P� can also be rewritten as the same kinematic decomposition

for the elastic stiffness E0 and compliance C0 of the material, respectively. In the above constitutive relations, the

elastic and inelastic strains .�e; �in/ are expressed as

�e D C0 W � ; �in D �d C �p D Cd W � C �p (2.10)

where the damage strain tensor �d WD Cd W � represents the recoverable inelastic strain, with Cd WD C � C0 being

the fourth-order damage compliance which is of identical evolution law as the total one C, i.e., PCd D PC.

Either of the above two alternative kinematics can be employed to develop elastoplastic damage models. The

equivalence between the resulting models has been proved recently in Cervera and Wu (2015); Wu and Cervera

(2015).

Remark 2.1 Similarly to the kinematic decomposition (2.8), the stored strain energy density (equal in magnitude to

the complementary energy density for the material with linear unloading/reloading behavior)  ed defined in Eq. (2.3)

where q0� q WD �@�=@� denotes the stress-like internal variable conjugate to the strain-like one �, with q0 being the

initial value of the residual material strength q.�/, i.e., q0 WD q.� D 0/.

Let us consider a rate-independent softening solid characterized by the failure criterion F.� ; q/ � 0, where the
loading function F.� ; q/ is a convex, smooth and differentiable homogeneous function of degree M � 1

function F.� ; q/ can be employed in the modeling of localized failure in solids.

Accordingly, the postulate of maximum energy dissipation gives the following associated evolution laws (Meschke

et al., 1998; Wu and Xu, 2011)

� satisfies the classical Kuhn-Tucker loading/unloading conditions

� � 0; F.� ; q/ � 0; �F.� ; q/ D 0 (2.16)

Note that the convex loading function (2.14) and the associated evolution laws (2.15) automatically guarantees the

energy dissipation inequality (2.13) for any softening law q.�/; see Wu and Cervera (2014b).

As a single failure criterion is employed in this work to characterize the inelastic behavior, it is impossible to

derive the evolution laws for both thecompliance C and the plastic strain �p with no extra assumption. Though other

alternatives can be considered, the simplest strategy to overcome this difficulty is to differentiate the damage and

plastic contributions to the dissipative strain rate P�dis with a model parameter � 2 Œ0; 1�. This results in the following

The cases � D 0 and � D 1 correspond to the classical plasticity model (Chen, 1994) and the elastic damage (degra-

dation) model (Carol et al., 1994; Wu and Xu, 2013), respectively. For the intermediate parameter � 2 .0; 1/, both the

material compliance C (or the damage one Cd) and the plastic strain �p are internal variables, resulting in a combined

plastic-damage model.

When the material is unloading, i.e., F.� ; q/ < 0, it follows that � D 0; for the loading case, � > 0 is solved
from the consistency condition PF.� ; q/ D 0, i.e.,

PF D � W P� � �h �H � h D � W E W

or, equivalently,

� D
� W E W P�

� W E W �C h �H � h
D

� W P�

h �H � h
(2.20)

for the softening modulus H WD @q=@� < 0. Therefore, the rate constitutive relations are given by

P� D Etan W P�; P� D Ctan W P� (2.21)

where the material tangents Etan and Ctan for the loading state (i.e., � > 0) are expressed as

Ctan D C C

(2.22b)

both being symmetric due to the associated evolution laws considered.

2.3. Fracture energy

For the above elastoplastic-damage model the external energy density supplied to the solid during the failure

process, or the so-called specific fracture energy (i.e., energy dissipation per unit volume) gf, can be evaluated as (Wu

and Cervera, 2014b, 2015)

b
(2.23)

where Gf is the fracture energy (i.e., energy dissipation per unit surface area), assumed as a material property; b is

a regularization width (see the discussion in next section) where the energy dissipation is lumped. Therefore, the

softening law q.�/ has to be regularized with respect to the regularization band width b in such a way that the energy

dissipation during the whole failure process does not depend on it.

The above regularization procedure was advocated in the crack band theory (Bažant and Oh, 1983). It is equivalent

to the cohesive (fictitious) crack model (Barenblatt, 1959; Dugdale, 1960; Hillerborg et al., 1976). In this latter context,

behavior of the material, e.g., the damage compliance Cd, the plastic strain �p and the inelastic strain �in, etc., are all

inversely proportional to the band width b. �

3. Strain localization analysis

In this section, strain localization in an inelastic solid characterized by the above elastoplastic damage model is

analyzed. Compared to the classical discontinuous bifurcation analysis (Hill, 1958, 1962; Rice and Rudnicki, 1980;

Rudnicki and Rice, 1975; Runesson et al., 1991; Thomas, 1961), the traction continuity and stress boundedness are

guaranteed (Cervera et al., 2012; Wu and Cervera, 2013, 2014a) by reproducing the Maxwell’s discontinuity kine-

matics. More specifically, upon strain localization the dissipative flow tensor characterizing the inelastic evolution

laws evolves into a particular structure in terms of a dissipative flow vector and the discontinuity orientation. Accord-

ingly, the tensorial flow components in the directions orthogonal to the discontinuity orientation have to vanish so

that the consistent loading/unloading deformation states upon strain localization are correctly represented and a fully

stress-free discontinuity (band) can eventually form. This property allows developing a traction-based plastic-damage

model for the discontinuity (band). Both the orientation and the traction-based failure criterion can be determined a

posteriori from the given stress-based counterpart.

3.1. Discontinuity kinematics

Let us consider the domain ˝ � Rndim .ndim D 1; 2; 3/ shown in Fig. 3. It is occupied by a solid with reference

position vector x 2 Rndim . The boundary is denoted by � � Rndim�1, with an external unit normal vector n�.

Deformations of the solid are characterized by the displacement field u W ˝ ! Rndim and the infinitesimal strain

field � WD rsymu, with r.�/ being the spatial gradient operator. The solid is subjected to a distributed body force

b
�
W ˝ ! Rndim per unit volume. Surface tractions t� W �t ! Rndim and displacements u� W �u ! Rndim are imposed

on the disjoint and complementary parts �t � � and �u � � of the boundary � , respectively.

At the early stage of the deformation process, the standard kinematics of a continuum medium apply. In particular,

both the displacement and strain fields are continuous and regular (bounded). Upon satisfaction of a specific criterion,

strain localization occurs, inevitably inducing strain/displacement jumps. To approximate these jumps, a strong (or

regularized) discontinuity may be introduced. In either case, the standard kinematics no longer applies.

Displacement jumps can be described by a strong discontinuity. As depicted in Fig. 4(a), the interface S splits the
solid ˝ into two parts ˝C and ˝�, located “ahead of” and “behind” S, respectively, in such a way that ˝C [˝� [

S D ˝. The discontinuity orientation is characterized by a unit normal vector n, pointing from ˝� to ˝C and fixed
along time (i.e., Pn D 0). The strong discontinuity S causes displacement jumpsw WD u.x 2 ˝C\S/�u.x 2 ˝�\S/
across it. In this case, the displacement field u.x/ is expressed as

u.x/ D u�.x/CHS .x/ Ou.x/; Ou.x/ WD u
C.x/ � u�.x/ (3.1a)

so that the strain field �.x/ is given by

�.x/ WD rsymu.x/ D rsymu�.x/CHS .x/ r
sym
Ou.x/C

�
w� n

�sym
ıS .x/ (3.1b)

where u�.x/ and uC.x/ denote the displacement fields in the parts ˝� and ˝C, respectively, with the former also

representing the continuous displacement field in the solid ˝; Ou.x/ W ˝ ! Rndim signifies the relative displacement

field of one part˝C with respect to the other one˝�, satisfying the property Ou.x 2 S/ D w; HS .x/ is the Heaviside
function defined at the interface S, i.e., HS .x/ D 0 if x 2 ˝� [ S and HS .x/ D 1 otherwise; ıS .x/ denotes the
Dirac-delta at the discontinuity S.

The unbounded strain field (3.1b) resulting from the discontinuous displacement field (3.1a) can be regularized

over a discontinuity band B of finite width b. Note that the width b is not a physical length but a regularization parame-
ter which can be made as small as desired. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the regularized discontinuity (or discontinuity band)

B is delimited by two surfaces SC and S� parallel to the discontinuity S, i.e., ˝C [˝� [ B D ˝. In this case, the
displacement field u.x/ is continuous, with an apparent displacement jumpw WD u.x 2 ˝C\SC/�u.x 2 ˝�\S�/
across the discontinuity band B. Accordingly, the C0-continuous displacement field u.x/ is expressed as (Wu et al.,
2015; Wu and Li, 2015)

u.x/ D u�.x/CHB.x/ Ou.x/ (3.2a)

�B.x/ D 1 if x 2 B and �B.x/ D 0 otherwise.

“behind” the surface S�, respectively. Furthermore, once the discontinuity (band) forms, the strain �S WD �.x 2 S/ at

the discontinuity (band) always exhibits a jump with respect to the strain �C

inversely proportional to b for a regularized discontinuity (or unbounded for a strong one).

In summary, the strong discontinuity S induces a discontinuous displacement field u.x/ and a singular (un-
bounded) strain field �.x/; see Fig. 5(a). Contrariwise, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the kinematic of a regularized dis-

continuity is characterized by a continuous displacement field u.x/ and a regular (bounded) strain field �.x/.

Remark 3.1 As the discontinuity band width b tends to zero, it follows that

That is, the strong discontinuity can be regarded as the limit of a regularized one, with a vanishing band width b ! 0.

Reciprocally, a discontinuity band can be regarded as the convenient regularization of a strong discontinuity. �

Remark 3.2 In our previous work (Cervera and Wu, 2015; Wu and Cervera, 2014b, 2015), it is assumed that the

relative displacement field Ou.x/ is induced only by relative rigid body motions (e.g. translations and rotations) of

one part ˝C with respect to the other one ˝� (Wu, 2011). That is, its contribution to the strain field vanishes, i.e.,

r
sym
Ou.x/ D 0 and �C

S
. Accordingly, the strains at both sides of the discontinuity are continuous, though the

relative displacement field Ou.x/ is not necessarily constant. This restrictive assumption is disregarded in this work. �

3.2. Strain localization of softening solids

For strain localization to occur in a softening solid and to evolve eventually into a fully softened discontinuity at

the final stage of the deformation process, material points inside the discontinuity (band) undergo inelastic loading

while those outside it unload elastically (Cervera et al., 2012; Oliver et al, 1999). That is, all the energy dissipative

mechanisms (i.e., damage evolution and plastic flows of interest) are restricted to the discontinuity (band) during the

subsequent failure process and do not develop in the bulk. Owing to this fact, though the continuous inelastic strains

prior to strain localization can be included as in Remark 3.3, they are neglected for the sake of simplicity and only

linear elastic bulk materials are considered in this work.

Upon strain localization, the following traction continuity condition has also to be fulfilled in addition to the

classical equilibrium equations

cannot be guaranteed). On the other hand, the remaining two terms are both inversely proportional to the bandwidth

b for the regularized discontinuity (or even singular for the strong one); see Remark 2.2 and Eq. (3.4). Therefore, the

kinematic relation (3.12) holds if and only if the elastic item is canceled, leading to

That is, upon strain localization in softening solids, traction continuity along with stress boundedness requires that the

strain jump, defined as the difference in the strain fields between the interior/exterior points of the discontinuity

(band) and characterized by Maxwell’s compatibility condition, has to be completely inelastic.

Remark 3.3 Inelastic deformations prior to strain localization caused by, e.g., damage and plasticity, can also be

incorporated. In this context, the above problem can be regarded as inelastic discontinuities localized in an equivalent

elastic medium with a damaged stiffness and some irreversible plastic strains, say xE and N�p, respectively, which are

both frozen once strain localization occurs; see Fig. 6. Namely, one only needs to replace the linear elasticity tensor

E0 by the fixed damaged bulk one xE, and subtract the fixed bulk plastic strain N�p from the total one, while all the other

procedures remain unchanged. �

Remark 3.4 Note that the above novel strain localization, and in particular, the kinematic constraint (3.13), can also

be written in rate form, but no additional insight in the problem is gained.

3.3. Application to the elastoplastic damage model

a system of nonlinear equations so that the discontinuity angles �cr can be solved. �

3.4. Traction-based failure criterion

It follows from the constraints (3.19) that, upon strain localization the failure criterion F.� ; q/ � 0 does not
depend on the stress components .�mm; �pp; �mp/, but is only a function of the tractions t D

on the discontinuity (band). Accordingly, provided the characteristic angles �cr satisfying the kinematic constraint

(3.16) or (3.19) exist, it is always possible to derive a traction-based failure criterion consistent with the given stress-

based counterpart F.� ; q/ � 0.
Let us consider the following stress-based failure function

F.� ; q/ WD yF .I; q/ � 0 (3.23)

with the dissipative flow tensor � given by

� D y� WD

represents the second invariant of the deviatoric stress s WD � � 1

tr.� /I , respectively.

Accordingly, the relation (3.16) becomes

�
 � n

�sym
D �; � D y� WD

@ yF

@�
(3.25)

In this case, the orientation n.�cr/ cannot be assumed arbitrarily. But rather, it has to be determined from the kinematic

constraints (3.19) for the given stress-based dissipative flow tensor � D y�. On the one hand, as the set of equations

is nonlinear, the solution may not exist at all. If and only if the discontinuity orientation n.�cr/ and the associated

dissipative flow vector  satisfying the kinematic constraint (3.25) exist for the given dissipative flow tensor y�, can

the strong (or regularized) discontinuity forms upon strain localization, and vice versa. On the other hand, provided

the solution exists, it depends only on the given failure criterion and the stress state, but not on the elastic properties

(i.e., Poisson’s ratio �0).

Once the discontinuity orientation n.�cr/ is so determined, the corresponding dissipative flow vector  can be

obtained from Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18). The projected traction-based failure criterion f .t; q/ � 0 is then determined as

f .t; q/ WD yF .� ; q/ D

where the following identity

� W � D  �

�
D  � t (3.27)

between the dissipative flow tensor � and the localized counterpart  has been considered.

Remark 3.6 An alternative strategy is to introduce explicitly the traction-based failure criterion yf .t; q/ � 0, not

necessarily coincident with the projected one (3.26), in an ad hoc manner. In such approaches (Cervera and Wu, 2015),

it is assumed a priori that the strong (or regularized) discontinuity can always form once strain localization occurs.

Accordingly, the discontinuity orientation cannot be determined uniquely from the kinematic constraints (3.19) for

the given traction-based failure criterion yf .t; q/ � 0, unless extra auxiliary conditions are introduced. In our previous

work (Cervera and Wu, 2015), the classical Mohr’s maximization postulate (Mohr, 1900) is adopted; see Appendix A

for its relations to the kinematic constraints (3.19). The bi-directional connections and in particular, the equivalence

conditions between these two strategies are referred to in Wu and Cervera (2014b, 2015). �

Therefore, provided the kinematic constraint resulting from the traction continuity along with stress bounded-

ness is fulfilled, consistent traction-based constitutive laws for the discontinuity (band) naturally emerge from the

strain localization analysis of stress-based models with regularized softening regime.

Remark 3.7 For the damage compliance tensor Cd in Eq. (3.28)2, the (complementary) damage free energy density

Remark 3.8 In the above localized plastic-damage model, the strain-like internal variable � is employed in the

softening law q.�/. Accordingly, the resulting localized constitutive laws are expressed in terms of the traction t and

the inelastic deformation vector e. Recalling the relations (2.25), the equivalent localized model in terms of tractions

t versus displacement jumps w can also be developed. The details are omitted here. �

4. Plane stress and plane strain cases

In this section let us consider strain localization of a 2D softening solid ˝ � R2 in plane stress and plane

strain shown in Fig. 8. The in-plane principal stresses are denoted by �1 and �2 (�1 � �2), respectively, while

the third one �3 is orthogonal to that plane. In such 2D cases the discontinuity orientation can be characterized by

the inclination angle (counterclockwise) � 2 Œ��=2; �=2� between the normal vector n and the principal vector v1

of the stress tensor. The tangential vectors m and p of the discontinuity S are located on and perpendicular to the
plane of interest, respectively. The task is to derive explicitly the discontinuity angle � cr and the traction-based failure

criterion f .t; q/ � 0 from the given stress-based one yF .� ; q/ � 0. Several classical failure criteria, i.e., Rankine,

Mohr-Coulomb, von Mises and Drucker-Prager models, are considered; see Wu and Cervera (2014b) for more general

examples.

17



4.1. Discontinuity angle

For a given stress-based failure criterion yF .� ; q/ � 0, the discontinuity angle � cr can be determined explicitly

through the projection relation (3.25) or more specifically, through the kinematic constraints (3.19), i.e.,

y�mm.�
cr/ D 0; y�pp.�

cr/ D 0 (4.1)

Note that in 2D cases the other constraint y�mp.� cr/ D 0 is automatically satisfied.

It follows from the Mohr’s circle and the constraint y�mm.� cr/ D 0 that (Wu and Cervera, 2014b, 2015)

sin2 � cr D �
y�2

y�1 � y�2
; cos2 � cr D

y�1

y�1 � y�2
(4.2)

where y�1 and y�2 (assuming y�1 � y�2 as usual) denote the principal values of the dissipative flow tensor �. Note

that the above results apply upon the conditions y�1 � 0 and y�2 � 0; see Appendix B for the exceptional cases.

Obviously, the discontinuity angle � cr depends on the ratio y�2= y�1 or the stress state upon strain localization.

In particular, the states of plane stress and plane strain have to be discriminated regarding the remaining condition,

y�pp D 0.

4.1.1. Plane stress

In the case of plane stress, the component �pp D �3 D 0 vanishes so that it is not necessary to consider the

vanishing dissipative flow component y�pp D y�3 D 0. Therefore, once the initial failure surface is reached, i.e.,

yF .� ; q0/ D 0, the strong (or regularized) discontinuity forms at the same instant, with the orientation determined

from Eqs. (4.2).

4.1.2. Plane strain

In the case of plane strain (i.e. �3 D 0), on the one hand, the elastic out-of-plane stress �3 is given by

�3 D �0
�
�1 C �2

�
(4.3)

On the other hand, for the homogeneous loading function yF .� ; q/ of degree M � 2, the condition y�pp D 0 gives

y�pp D y�3 D 0 H) �3 D �1
�
�1 C �2

�
C �2q (4.4)

where �1 and �2 are related to the model parameters involved in the specified stress-based failure criterion OF .� ; q/ �

0; see the examples presented later. As the in-plane principal values y�1 and y�2 depend on the out-of-plane stress

�3 ¤ 0, the discontinuity angle � cr, still determined from Eq. (4.2), is affected by this extra plane strain localization

condition.

The out-of-plane stress (4.4), necessary for plane strain localization, is in general different from the elastic value

(4.3). Furthermore, the initial limit surface yF .� ; q0/ D 0 will be reached earlier with the elastic out-of-plane stress

(4.3) than with the localized one (4.4). Accordingly, except for very particular cases, strain localization cannot occur

18



at the onset of softening. Rather, some (continuous) inelastic deformations and substantial rotation of the principal

strain directions have to occur at the beginning of the softening regime, until the plane strain localization condition

(4.4) is fulfilled. From that moment on, the (continuous) inelastic deformations in the bulk material are frozen (un-

loading), and the discontinuous inelastic deformations within the discontinuity (band) continue growing due to strain

localization. That is, the bulk material is considered as linear elastic after strain localization occurs, however, with

degraded (unloading) stiffness and plastic deformations corresponding to those at the time when strain localization

is initiated. The above delayed strain localization in the plane strain condition, similarly to the transited continuous-

discontinuous failure (Jirásek and Zimmermann, 2001) illustrated in Fig. 9, was numerically observed in Cervera et

al. (2012) for von Mises (J2) model. As shown in Section 4.6, it also occurs for other failure criteria like the classical

Drucker-Prager model.

Remark 4.1 In the case of plane stress, the discontinuity angle � cr determined from Eqs. (4.2) coincides with

that obtained from the classical discontinuous bifurcation analysis (Runesson et al., 1991) for the material model

with associated evolution laws. Comparatively, in the plane strain state the discontinuous bifurcation analysis gives

(Runesson et al., 1991)

sin2 � cr D �
y�2 C �0 y�3

y�1 � y�2
; cos2 � cr D

y�1 C �0 y�3

y�1 � y�2
(4.5)

The above results coincide with Eqs. (4.2) if �0 D 0 or y�3 D 0. The later condition, y�3 D 0, necessary for the

strong or regularized discontinuity to form and to develop eventually into a fully softened one, is not accounted for

in the classical discontinuous bifurcation analysis. An exception is the so-called zero-extension line theory for Mohr-

Coulomb materials; see Ottosen and Runesson (1991); Roscoe (1970) for the details. Therefore, the results derived

from Maxwell’s compatibility condition are consistent with, but more demanding than, the classical ones. �

4.2. Traction-based failure criterion

With the discontinuity angle � cr determined from Eq. (4.2), the normal and tangential components .n; m/ of the

dissipative flow vector  are given by

n D y�nn.�
cr/ D

�
y�1 � y�2

In accordance with Eq. (3.26), the stress-based failure criterion yF .� ; q/ � 0 is projected to the orientation n.� cr/,

leading to the following traction-based counterpart

cases are also dealt with in Appendix B.

Therefore, provided strain localization occurs, the tractions .tn; tm/ do maximize the projected traction-based failure

4.3. Example: Rankine criterion

The Rankine criterion, widely adopted for the modeling of tensile failure in quasi-brittle materials, is expressed in

terms of the major principal stress �1 D v1 � � � v1 > 0 as

yF .� ; q/ D h�1i � q DH .�1/ �1 � q � 0 (4.10)

where the Macaulay brackets h�i is defined as hxi D max.x; 0/.

In both plane stress and plane strain conditions, it follows from Eq. (4.2) that

sin2 � cr D 0 H) � cr D 0 (4.11)

As expected, only a mode I discontinuity (in the context of fracture mechanics) can be initiated. Furthermore, with

the discontinuity angle (4.11), the traction-based failure criterion (4.7) becomes

f .t; q/ D htni � q � 0 (4.12)

where the relation �1 D n � � � n D tn has been considered for mode-I failure.

The above results coincide with those obtained from Mohr’s maximization postulate.

In the case of plane strain, the extra constraint y�3 D 0 cannot be satisfied in Regions 1 and 3; only in Region 2

(i.e., �1 � �3 � �2) can strain localization occur, with the same discontinuity angle (4.15).

For the discontinuity angle (4.15), in Region 2 (�1 � �3 � �2) the traction-based failure criterion (4.6) reads

Region 2 (�1 � �3 � �2), the discontinuity angle is then � cr D �=4 so that

As can be seen, in the condition of plane strain the discontinuity angle is fixed as � cr D 45ı independently of the

As depicted in Fig. 11, only for the particular case �0 D 0:5 or �2 D ��1, can strain localization occur at the onset

of strain softening. For all other cases, the elastic limit surface (4.28) will be reached first and strain softening occurs

accompanied with (continuous) inelastic deformations. Only when sufficient re-orientation of the principal strain

directions is completed and the plane strain localization condition (4.25) is fulfilled, strain localization sets in motion

and a strong (regularized) discontinuity forms. �

Remark 4.7 For the parameter ˛ 2 Œ1=2; 1/, the Drucker-Prager failure criterion (4.30) defines an open surface in

the principle �1 � �2 space. Accordingly, there exists a limit value for the discontinuity angle � cr. For the parabolic

That is, in the case of plane strain, the material characterized by the Drucker-Prager model localizes into a Mohr-

Prager and Mohr-Coulomb models give identical limit load for perfectly-plastic materials in the case of plane strain.

Furthermore, upon satisfaction of these plane strain matching conditions, both models produce identical energy dissi-

pation (Chen, 1994).

5. Conclusions

Aiming for the modeling of localized failure in quasi-brittle solids, this paper presents a unified elastoplastic-

damage framework based on the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. Both concepts of degradation strain rate

and damage strain are incorporated to develop an elastoplastic damage model, with evolution laws for the involved

internal variables characterized by a dissipative flow tensor. To explore its use in the modeling of strong or regularized

discontinuities, a novel strain localization analysis is proposed to prognosticate their occurrence based on continuity

of tractions on and across the discontinuity (band). The resulting kinematic localization condition is in general more

demanding than the classical discontinuous bifurcation one. The kinematic constraint, on the one hand, is sufficient to

guarantee the traction continuity and stress boundedness; on the other hand, it is necessary to reproduce the consistent

loading/unloading deformation states upon strain localization in quasi-brittle solids and to guarantee formation of a

fully softened discontinuity.

For such strain localization to occur with a strong (or regularized) discontinuity, it is necessary that Maxwell’s

kinematics of the discontinuity (band) be reproduced in an appropriate manner. Regarding the elastoplastic damage

model considered in this work, the components of the dissipative flow tensor in the directions orthogonal to the discon-

tinuity orientation have to vanish upon strain localization. Satisfaction of this kinematic constraint allows developing

a localized plastic-damage model for the inelastic discontinuity (band), with both its orientation and the correspond-

ing traction-based failure criterion determined consistently from the given stress-based counterpart. The projected

discontinuity approach so derived avoids introducing the cohesive zone model in an ad hoc manner. In particular, the

27



involved model parameters can be calibrated from available macroscopic material test data as demonstrated in our

previous work (Cervera and Wu, 2015; Wu and Cervera, 2015). Furthermore, the right instant for the occurrence of

strong (or regularized) discontinuities and the introduction of localized models can also be identified.

The aforementioned general results are particularized to 2D conditions of plane stress and plane strain. The dis-

continuity orientation and the corresponding traction-based failure criterion are obtained in closed-form for a given

stress-based counterpart. Finally, the Rankine, Mohr-Coulomb, von Mises (J2) and Drucker-Prager criteria are ana-

lyzed as illustrative examples, with the analytical discontinuity angles coincident with those obtained from numerical

simulations. It is found that in the case of plane stress, strain localization with a strong (regularized) discontinuity can

occur at the onset of strain softening. Contrariwise, owing to the extra out-of-plane kinematic constraint, in the condi-

tion of plane strain some continuous inelastic deformations and substantial re-orientation of principal strain directions

have to take place prior to strain localization.

So far only homogeneous materials with a single discontinuity have been considered. In heterogeneous materials

like reinforced concrete or other composites, multiple discontinuities may be initiated, possibly with branching. In

such complex situations, orientation and spacing of the discontinuities are affected strongly by the reinforcing phases.

It would be instructive to investigate the application and extension of the current method to more challenging issues.

where the identity vi �

relations (3.18), the stationarity condition (A.2) becomes (Wu and Cervera, 2015)

As the failure function yf .t; q/ � 0 depends only on the tractions t WD
˚
�nn; �nm; �np

	T
, the condition (A.4) is

fulfilled for arbitrary values of the remaining stress components .�mm; �mp; �pp/, i.e.,

�mm.y�

cr

cr

The above relations correspond exactly to the kinematic constraints (3.19).

If the solution to Eqs. (A.5) does not exist, the discontinuity angles y�

should be determined from another set of

solution to Eqs. (A.4)

Contrariwise, if the solution to the kinematic constraints (3.19) does not exist for the stress-based material model,

strain localization into a strong (regularized) discontinuity cannot occur. In this exceptional situation, the given stress-

based failure criterion can be modified based on the solution to Eq. (A.6) so that both families of approaches are

completely equivalent as shown in Wu and Cervera (2014b, 2015); see Appendix B for the 2D cases.

Appendix B. Exceptional 2D cases

For 2D cases in which y�2 > 0 or y�1 < 0, the discontinuity angle � cr cannot be determined from Eq. (4.2). It

implies that strain localization into a strong (regularized) discontinuity cannot occur for the given stress-based failure

criterion yF .� ; q/ � 0.

In this exceptional situation, some necessary modifications should be made in such a way that strain localization

into a strong (regularized) discontinuity may still occur in the stress-based inelastic solid and the resulting projected

discontinuity approach is completely equivalent to a traction-based strong/regularized one. That is, the discontinuity

angle is given from the solution to Eqs. (A.6), i.e.,

sin.2� cr/ D 0 H) � cr D

8̂<̂
:
0 y�1 > y�2 > 0

�=2 y�2 < y�1 < 0

(B.1)

which corresponds to the limit values y�2 D 0 and y�1 D 0 in Eq. (4.2), respectively.

As depicted in Figs. 10(a) and 12, this strategy introduces tension- and compression-extensions into the original

stress-based failure criterion yF .� ; q/ � 0. Similarly, the projected traction-based failure function f .t; q/ is given by

where the tangential traction is removed from the failure criterion (4.7). With the above modifications, the stress- and

traction-based models are completely equivalent to each other as shown in Wu and Cervera (2014b, 2015).
