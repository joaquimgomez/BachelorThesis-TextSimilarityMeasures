Abstract

The aim of this work is to propose a monotonicity-preserving method for discontinuous Galerkin (dG)
approximations of convection-diffusion problems. To do so, a novel definition of discrete maximum
principle (DMP) is proposed using the discrete variational setting of the problem, and we show that
the fulfilment of this DMP implies that the minimum/maximum (depending on the sign of the forcing
term) is on the boundary for multidimensional problems. Then, an artificial viscosity (AV) technique is
designed for convection-dominant problems that satisfies the above mentioned DMP. The noncomplete
stabilized interior penalty dG method is proved to fulfil the DMP property for the one-dimensional
linear case when adding such AV with certain parameters. The benchmarks for the constant values to
satisfy the DMP are calculated and tested in the numerical experiments section. Finally, the method is
applied to different test problems in one and two dimensions to show its performance.

Keywords: discontinuous Galerkin, stabilized finite elements, shock capturing, nonlinear stabilization,
convection-diffusion, convection-dominated flows

1. Introduction

It is well known that the operator L associated to an elliptic problem such as the convection-diffusion
problem enjoys the maximum property, meaning that the maximum (resp., minimum) of the solution to
the problem Lu = f is achieved on the boundary of the domain if the source term, f , is negative (resp.,
positive). In particular, this property ensures that the solution of the problem will not show oscillations.
It is well known that the solution of a convection-dominated problem may present sharp layers that may
induce spurious oscillations in the discrete approximation of the solution. We are interested in finding a
method that ensures a similar maximum property at the discrete discontinuous level in order to obtain
a method that gives oscillation free solutions.

When the problem is discretized, this maximum property may be inherited by what is called discrete
maximum principle (DMP). Several definitions of the DMP have been proposed in the literature for
continuous discrete approximations (see [13, 16, 27, 7, 26]). Some of them are equivalent while some
others are weaker or stronger. There is also a lot of literature about the conditions on the mesh for the
Poisson problem to enjoy the DMP [16, 29, 17, 25] as well as discrete methods specially implemented
to fulfil such property. Methods have been designed for linear finite differences [9] and continuous linear
finite elements [8, 13, 23, 5, 7, 6]. These methods are implicit in sense, and usually based on the addition of
AV to the problem at hand; they are traditionally called shock (or discontinuity)-capturing techniques,
even though we favour the notation nonlinear stabilization. Some approaches to prove a DMP using
piecewise higher order polynomials have been done [24, 25, 20, 29, 28, 31, 32] but only the Poisson
problem has been proved to enjoy the DMP and only on certain one-dimensional (1D) meshes [29] and
on very restrictive quadratic and cubic two dimensional meshes [22, 16]. When it comes to discontinuous
methods, most of the shock capturing techniques are based on the concept of slope limiter, proposed
by Cockburn and Shu for conservation laws [11, 10] and latter adapted to the convection-dominated
convection-diffusion problem [12]. The same strategy can be applied to finite volume methods (see

[33, 34, 35]). Again, these methods consist in a postprocess after the solution is computed and are
designed for explicit methods. However, as far as we know, there are no works dealing with nonlinear
stabilization and implicit DMP-preserving dG formulations. In fact, even the definition of what a DMP
for dG means is open.

Concerning to the study of the DMP for the Poisson problem in the dG setting, there is only one
work by Horváth and Mincsovics [17]; they analyse the fulfilment of certain condition on the stiffness
matrix K that ensure the following property for the 1D interior penalty (IP) method:

Ku ≤ 0 =⇒ max u ≤ max{0,max u∂Ω}.

The aim of this work is twofold. On one side, we propose a new (variational) definition of the DMP
for dG, and we prove that it is a sufficient condition to have the the minimum/maximum (depending
on the sign of the forcing term) on the boundary for multidimensional problems. The new definition
is stronger than the one given in [17] and it is, in some sense, closer to the one used in [4] for the 1D
continuous Galerkin (cG) discretization of the Burgers’ equation. On the other hand, we construct a
multidimensional nonlinear stabilization based on AV for dG methods and prove that, when restricted
to the 1D case, the nonlinear stabilization combined with an incomplete (or weighted) IP dG method
with upwinding is capable to ensure our DMP for the discrete dG solution of (1). In any case, numerical
experiments evindence that the method also satisfies the DMP in the multidimensional case.

The outline of the article is the following. In Section 2 we introduce the continuous convection-
diffusion problems and its Galerkin discretization using finite elements. The IP dG method for the
Laplacian is presented in Section 3. Our novel definition of the DMP for the dG scheme is proposed in
Section 4 and some good properties derived from it are stated. Moreover, in Subsection 4.1, we prove
that the IP method for the Laplacian enjoys the DMP in the 1D case. The extension of the IP method for
the convection-diffusion problem is given in Section 5. In Section 6, an AV technique is proposed for the
1D case, and we prove that it satisfies the DMP. Further, we extend the method to the multidimensional
case. Numerical experiments are included in Section 7. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section
8.

2. Weak Form and Notation

We will consider the convection-diffusion problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions:{
Lu := −∇ · (µ∇u) +∇ · (βu) = f in Ω,

u = g on ∂Ω.
(1)

We assume that µ ∈ L2(Ω) and β ∈ H1(Ω) ∩ C0(Ω) is solenoidal (∇ · β = 0). It is well known that the
operator L associated to problem (1) enjoys the maximum principle (for proofs on maximum principles
for elliptic problems see [14]).

Definition 1. We say that an operator L posseses the maximum principle if, for all u ∈ C2(Ω) ∩ C(Ω̄),
the following implication holds:

Lu ≤ 0 in Ω =⇒ max
S

u ≤ max
∂S

u ∀S ⊂ Ω.

Before studying how to achieve a maximum principle at the discrete level for the convection-diffusion
problem, we will focus on the rather simpler Poisson’s equation:{

−∆u = f in Ω
u = g on ∂Ω.

(2)

We denote by (·, ·)K the L2(K) inner product for any K ⊂ Ω and by (·, ·) the L2(Ω) product. We consider
(·, ·)h the L2(Ω)-scalar product evaluated using nodal quadrature (corresponding to the lumped mass
matrix). The bilinear form a(·, ·) associated to the problem (2) is a(u, v) = (∇u,∇v). So, the weak form
of (2) reads as:

Find u ∈ H1(Ω) such that a(u, v) = (f, v) ∀v ∈ H1(Ω). (3)

Let us consider partitions T Nh = {K} of Ω formed by simplicial elements K of characteristic length
hK ; we denote by h the characteristic size of the mesh. The corners of the mesh will be denoted by
xi, i = 1, · · · , Nh (Nh being the total number of corners), and the macroelement associated to xi
will be designated by Ωi = ∪xi∈KK. The discrete space considered henceforth is the discontinuous
space of piecewise linear functions Vh = {vh | vh|K ∈ P1(K) ∀K}. Let Eh = ∪K∈T N

h
∂K be the set

of the facets of the mesh and E0h = Eh\∂Ω. We define T (Eh) =
∏
K∈T N

h
L2(∂K). The functions in

T (Eh) are double-valued on E0h and single-valued on ∂Ω; in particular, Vh|Eh ⊂ T (Eh). The functions
vh ∈ Vh can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis {ϕKi } where ϕ

K
i is defined for all pairs

{i,K} ∈ {1, · · · , Nh} × T Nh such that xi ∈ K. ϕ
K
i corresponds to the discontinuous function that is

linear in K, with ϕKi (xi) = 1 and ϕ
K
i (xj) = 0 for xj ∈ K, j 6= i, and ϕ

K
i = 0 for x ∈ Ω \ K. So, a

function vh ∈ Vh would read as:

vh(x) =

Nh∑
i=1

∑
K⊂Ωi

uKi ϕ
K
i (x), ∀x ∈ Ω.

Moreover we can define the solution in a single element K as uKh (x) =
∑
xi∈K u

K
i ϕ

K
i (x), ∀x ∈ K, and

its constant gradient ∇uKh =
∑
xi∈K u

0
h we know there are only two

elements, say K+F and K
−
F , such that ∂K

+
F ∩ ∂K

−
F = F . In addition, we can name n

+
F and n

−
F the

unitary normal to face F outside K+F and K
−
F , respectively. Given q ∈ T (Eh), we can define the common

concepts of average {{·}} and jump [[·]] on an interior point x of a facet F ∈ E0h as follows:

{{q}}(x) = 0.5(qK
+
F (x) + qK

−
F (x)), [[q]](x) = qK

+
F (x)n+F + q

K
−
F (x)n−F .

We also define the harmonic average of q on x as 〈q〉(x) = (2qK
+
F (x)qK

−
F (x))/(qK

+
F (x) + qK

−
F (x)). On

boundary points x ∈ ∂Ω, we define {{q}}(x) = q(x), [[q]](x) = q(x)n∂Ω(x) and 〈q〉(x) = q(x).

3. The Interior Penalty Method for the Poisson’s Problem

There are numerous dG methods in the literature to approximate the Poisson problem. Many of
them are contained in the unified analysis carried out by Arnold et al. in [1], where they conclude that
any dG method approximating the second-order elliptic problem −∆u = f uses the following bilinear
form:

ah(uh, vh) =

∫
Ω

∇uh∇vh +
∫
Eh

([[ũ− uh]]{{∇vh}} − {{σ̃}}[[vh]]) +
∫
E0
h

({{ũ− uh}}[[∇vh]]− [[σ̃]]{{vh}}),

where ũ = ũ(uh) and σ̃ = σ̃(uh) are scalar numerical fluxes that approximate u and ∇u respectively
on the boundaries of the elements. Different choices for these fluxes lead to different dG methods. We
consider the IP method, which consists in taking

ũ = {{uh}}+ ξnK · [[uh]], σ̃ = {{∇uh}} − C1[[uh]].

Given a facet F , the value C1(x) = c
iph̃−1 for any x ∈ F , where cip|F = c

ip
F is a facet constant to be

chosen and h̃|F = hF := minK̄⊃F {hK}. The parameter ξ can take values ξ = 0, 0.5 or 1, leading to the
symmetric, incomplete, or nonsymmetric IP method, respectively:

ah(uh, vh) =

∫
Ω

∇uh∇vh −
∫
Eh

((1− 2ξ)[[uh]]{{∇vh}}+ {{∇uh}}[[vh]]) +
∫
Eh
ciph̃−1[[uh]][[vh]]. (4)

According to the analysis performed in [17], the best option in order to guarantee the DMP is to choose
ξ = 0.5.

4. Discrete Maximum Principle

We recall the definition of DMP given by Burman and Ern in [5, 4] for the linear cG method:

Definition 2 (DMP cG). We say that the semilinear form ah(uh, v) has the DMP property if the
following holds true: ∀uh ∈ Vh ∩ C(Ω) and for all interior vertex xi, if uh is locally minimal (resp.,
maximal) on vertex xi over a macroelement Ωi (i.e., uh(xi) ≤ uh(x), ∀x ∈ Ωi), there exists γK > 0 such
that

ah(uh, ϕi) ≤ −
∑
K⊂Ωi

γK |∇uh|K |,

(resp., ah(uh, ϕi) ≥
∑
K⊂Ωi γK |∇uh|K |) where ϕi is the continuous shape function associated with the

node xi.

Basically, the previous definition ensures that, when f ≥ 0, the solution to the discrete problem associ-
ated with the bilinear form has no local discrete minimum in the interior of the domain. As far as we
know, there is no such a DMP definition for dG methods. So, we have to find out the properties that
the dG method should enjoy in order to have a solution without local extrema. But even the definition
of local extremum is not clear in dG. We have come up with the following definition of extremum:

Definition 3 (local discrete extremum). The function uh ∈ Vh has a local discrete minimum (resp.,
maximum) on node xi in K if u

K
i ≤ uh(x) (resp., u

K
i ≥ uh(x)) ∀x ∈ Ωi.

Remark 1. We use the adjective local to differentiate between the previous concept and a global
minimum of the function uh on xi in K, what would mean that u

K
i ≤ uh(x) for all x ∈ Ω. The adjective

discrete tries to emphasize that the definition is linked to the mesh provided in each case. Moreover, we
will use strict local discrete extremum when the strict inequality holds.

Now, taking into account the definition of local discrete extremum we are ready to give our own
definition of DMP for dG:

Definition 4 (DMP dG). We say that the bilinear form ah(uh, v) has the DMP property if the fol-
lowing holds true: for all uh ∈ Vh and for all interior vertex xi, if uh is locally minimal (resp., maximal)
on vertex xi in K, then there exist γF > 0 and δK > 0 such that

ah(uh, ϕ

i ) ≥

∑

F

|∇uKh |).

This definition implies the following interesting property for the solution of the method.

Lemma 1. Let ah(uh, vh) be a bilinear form enjoying the DMP property. If we solve the problem
ah(uh, vh) = (f, vh) with f ≥ 0 (resp., f ≤ 0), the solution uh has no strict local discrete minimum
(resp., maximum) in any interior point. As a result, the global minimum (resp. maximum) is on the
boundary.

Proof. Suppose that uh has a local discrete minimum on an interior node xi in K. Then, ah(uh, ϕ
K
i ) ≤

−
∑
F γFh

−1
F

∫
F
|[[uh]]| − δKh−1K

∫
K
|∇uKh | ≤ 0. Since (f, ϕ

K
i ) ≥ 0, it implies that ah(uh, ϕ

K
i ) = 0. Then,

the right hand side of (5) must be zero, implying that ∇uKh = 0 and [[uh]] = 0. Let K
′ ⊂ Ωi be a

finite element sharing a facet F with K. The previous result implies that uKh (x) = u
K′

h (x) for any

x ∈ F . In particular, uKi = u
K′

i , and using the definition of minimum, we infer that uh has a local
discrete minimum on xi in K

′ too. By induction, ∇uh = 0 on Ωi and uh|Ωi = uKi is constant. Clearly
the minimum is not strict. Since a global minimum on xi would imply, in particular, a local discrete
minimum, we could follow the same reasoning and deduce that the global minimum is shared by all the
nodes in Ωi. By induction, the function should be constant and the value of the function would be the
same as in the boundary. So the global minimum must be on the boundary. �

Remark 2. The DMP introduced before would correspond to a strong maximum principle at the
continuous level (see [14]).

Now let us consider the transient problem


ut −∆u = f in Ω,
u(x, 0) = u0(x) x ∈ Ω,
u(x, t) = g(x, t) x ∈ ∂Ω,

(6)

and discretise it (in space) as follows:

Finduh ∈ Vh such that (∂tuh, vh)h + ah(uh, vh) = (f, v) ∀vh ∈ Vh, (7)

almost everywhere in [0, T ]. It is possible to prove, following the same reasoning as the one in [4], that
the solution of the problem will enjoy the local extremum decreasing (LED) property. This property is
defined in the following lemma:

Lemma 2. Let uh be the solution of (7) with f = 0 and with the bilinear form ah(·, ·) satisfying the
DMP property. Then, any interior local discrete extremum of |uh| is decreasing in time.

Proof. Assume there is a local discrete maximum on node xi in element K. Taking vh = ϕ
K
i in (7)

and using the definition of lumped mass matrix, we have

∂tu
K
i (t) = −

(∫
K

ϕKi

)−1
ah(uh, ϕ

K
i ).

By the DMP property we know that ah(uh, ϕ
K
i ) ≥ 0. Thus, ∂tu

K
i (t) ≤ 0 and so, the local discrete

maximum is decreasing. The results for the minima follow the same fashion. �

4.1. DMP satisfaction for the 1D IP Method

In this section, we show that the IP method for the Poisson problem (4) enjoys the DMP property
in the 1D case for large enough values of cip. In order to make compact the notation for the proof, we
remark that in 1D the facets are the nodes xi and the integral over the facets reduces to the simple
evaluation of the value at that point, thus we define [[·]]i = [[·]](xi) and {{·}}i = {{·}}(xi). Given a node xi,
we will denote by K− and K+ the elements Ki = [xi−1, xi] and Ki+1 = [xi, xi+1] respectively; h− and
h+ will be their corresponding lengths. Moreover the outside normals are simply n− = 1 and n+ = −1.
There will be an abuse of notation in the proof of the proposition in which a binary parameter α is
going to be used; it will be {−,+} when used as a superscript of a node or subscript of an element and
{−1,+1} in the rest of the cases

Lemma 3. The bilinear form (4) with ξ = 0.5 (incomplete) enjoys the DMP property if cip > 0.5.

Proof. We will prove the DMP property assuming that there is a local discrete minimum on xi in the
element Kα either for α = − or α = +. The proof for the local discrete maximum case is equivalent.
Assuming that there is a minimum on xi in Kα, we can compute the following jumps and means:

[[uh]]i = α|[[uh]]i|, [[ϕKαi ]]i = −α, [[ϕ

Moreover, knowing that uKαh (xi) ≤ uh(x) for any x ∈ Kα ∪K−α, we can deduce that

In order to prove that ah(·, ·) enjoys the DMP property we need to prove that there exist γi > 0 and
δKα > 0 such that ah(uh, ϕ

5. Convection-Diffusion Problem

Considering the original problem (1) we will have to combine the previous terms with the IP terms
described in [3] to handle with the convective term ∇· (βu), which basically consists in adding the term

a
β
h(uh, vh) = −

∫

to the bilinear form and subtracting the term
∫
∂Ω−

β · n∂Ωgvh from the right hand side. The set E+h =
Eh\∂Ω−, where ∂Ω− = {x ∈ ∂Ω |β · n∂Ω(x) < 0} is the inflow boundary. We use cbmsi = 0.5 in our
computations, which is equivalent to use the upwind value of βuh instead of {{βuh}} and cbms = 0 in
(10).

For convection-dominated problems, the solution may present sharp layers, i.e., small intervals in
which the value of the solution changes abruptly. The IP method presented before can already control
the global instabilities of the solution but it may still present local overshoots and undershoots around
sharp layers. In particular, it means that the DMP is violated, so we would like to design a method
that ensures a DMP in order to avoid this kind of problems; we will do so by means of an AV. That is,
we will compute an extra AV, denoted by εh, in each K in such a way that it ensures the DMP; the
explicit definition of the AV is introduced in the next section (see Eq. 13). Since the extra viscosity is
not consistent, we will not add it in all the terms of the bilinear form, but only in those that are useful
for the DMP to be fulfilled.

Putting together the methods described in (4) and (10) with ξ = 0.5, using a piecewise constant
approximation of µ, given by µh|K := h−1K

∫
K
µdx, and taking the AV εh, we can define the dG problem

that we want to solve:

Find uh ∈ Vh such that ah(uh, vh) = l(vh) ∀vh ∈ Vh, (11)

where

ah(uh, vh) =

at the end of section 2).

6. The Artificial Viscosity technique

Now we are ready to design the AV in order to obtain a dG formulation satisfying the DMP property
defined above. In particular, we will consider a piecewise constant AV function εh = εh(uh) such that,
when added to µh, takes values in a bounded interval µK + εK := µh|K + εh|K ∈ [0,ΛK ], where
ΛK = max{ν‖β‖∞hK , µK} is the maximum amount of viscosity admitted in an element and ν > 0 is a
parameter to be fixed. We want that, if uh has a local discrete extremum on xi in K, then µK+εK = ΛK .
This will be achieved by scaling the AV using a shock detector s(uh) that will take values in the interval
[0, 1] with s = 1 in K if there is a local discrete extremum in the element. Notice that if µK + εK = ΛK
in every element K, the AV would correspond to the suboptimal isotropic diffusion introduced by Von
Neumann and Richtmyer in [30] for the continuous case. We will start by designing the detector s for
1D and then we will extend the definition to the multidimensional case.

In order to construct such a shock detector we need to come up with quantities that let us detect
where there is a local discrete extremum. Following the same notation as in the proof of Lemma 3, a
possible option is, for the point xi, to consider the values of the jump [[uh]]i, the derivatives in Kα and
K−α, and the corresponding lengths hα and h−α of the elements. Using these values we can compute
the shock detector function s:

sα(xi) =




∣∣∣uKαh,xhα − uK−αh,x h−α + 2[[uh]]i∣∣∣∣∣∣uKαh,xhα∣∣∣+ ∣∣∣[[uh]]i − uK−αh,x h−α∣∣∣+ |[[uh]]i|


q

Remark 3. The parameter q > 0 is to be chosen. Low values of q improve the nonlinear convergence
of the method since the value of sα(xi) changes smoothly between nonlinear iterations. On the other
hand, high values of q improve the accuracy of the method, since, for q −→ ∞, the detector becomes
binary and it only adds extra viscosity in the regions where there are local discrete extrema. Thus,
the value of q can be modified during computation time, reducing q to ease nonlinear convergence, or
increasing it to have sharper discontinuities at the expense of more CPU cost.

With the previous definition, it is easy to see that s fulfils the following property:

Lemma 4. Given a node xi ∈ E0 and uh ∈ Vh, the detector sα(xi) = sα(uh, xi) takes values in the
interval [0, 1] and sα(xi) = 1 if and only if uh has a local discrete extremum on xi in Kα.

Proof. First of all, it is obvious that sα(xi) ≤ 1. Then, we notice that sα(xi) = 1 iff the sign of
uKαh,xhα, ([[uh]]i − u

K−α
h,x h−α) and [[uh]]i are the same. Observing Fig. 1(a) is easy to see that these three

values correspond to α(u
K+
h (xj+1)− u

Kα
h (xi)), α(u

K−
h (xj−1)− u

Kα
h (xi)), and α(u

K−α
h (xi)− u

Kα
h (xi)),

not necessarily in that order. So, by the definition of local discrete extremum, it is clear that these three
values will have the same sign iff there is a local discrete extremum on xi in Kα. �

For xi and K ⊂ Ωi, let us define the value ΓKi to be such that Γ
K
i = α if K is the element Kα with

respect to xi. Then, we can define the AV of the problem as:

εK(uh) = max{0, ν‖β‖∞hK max
xi∈K

{sΓK

If one is interested in recovering the symmetric or nonsymmetric form, it is possible to weight the
extra term using the same shock capturing in such a way that the term vanishes in the facets around
the elements with a local discrete extremum inside. For the symmetric term we define

ξ̃(xi) = 0.5 max
K⊂Ωi

sΓK

(resp., ξ̃(xi) = 1−0.5 maxK⊂Ωi sΓKi for the nonsymmetric term). Then, the weighted symmetric bilinear

Corollary 6. The weighted semilinear form ãh(·, ·) described in (14), with εh as in (13) and cbms = 0.5,
enjoys the DMP property for any value of q > 0 if ν > 1 and c

Proof. Since the term (1 − ξ̃(xj)) nullifies for xj ∈ K if there is a maximum in K, the term∫

(1− ξ̃)µ[[uh]]{{∇ϕh}} does not add any contribution to ãh(uh, ϕKi ). Thus, the results hold from the
proof of Theorem 5. �

The results of such technique are shown in the section 7.

6.1. Extension to the multidimensional case

Let us consider the multidimensional convection-diffusion problem (1). It is possible to extend the
nonlinear stabilization to the multidimensional case by generalising the computation of the AV. Even
though it is unclear whether the multidimensional IP dG methods for the Poisson equation satisfy
any DMP property, the underlying idea behind the multidimensional nonlinear stabilization design is
similar to what was proposed in [2]. For each element K in the mesh we must compute the amount of
AV εK = ε|K which will be scaled according to a shock detector s ∈ [0, 1] that takes value sK = 1 if
there is a local discrete extremum in K.

First of all, we must extend the definition of the shock detector function sα(xi) to the multidimen-
sional case. The definition will be done in two dimensions for simplicity, but it can be easily extended to
any space dimension. As it can be observed in Fig. 1(b), in the two-dimensional case, α is not a binary
parameter, but it corresponds to an angle, α ∈ [0, 2π), and it gives a certain direction, rα = (cosα, sinα).
Moreover the notation α− = α− π will be used to refer the opposite sense to α. The idea is to redefine
the parameters used above to compute sα(xi) by projecting the solution in the direction rα around the
node xi (see Fig. 1(b)).

In this sense, Kα = {K ⊂ Ωi | ∃ δ > 0 : xi + δrα ∈ K} and K−α = Kα− . Then, let xα ∈ ∂Kα
and hα > 0 be such that xα − xi = hαrα (h−α and x−α defined similarly for α−); see Fig. 1(b) for an
illustration. These parameters are uniquely defined unless the direction rα coincides with the direction
of one of the edges of the mesh but these directions are not required in the definition of sK below.

Finally we define [[uh]]
α
i = u

K−α
h (xi)− u

Kα
h (xi). So, we can redefine sα(xi) as:

sα(xi) =




∣∣∣∇uKαh · rαhα −∇uK−αh · rαh−α + 2[[uh]]αi ∣∣∣∣∣∣∇uKαh · rαhα∣∣∣+ ∣∣∣[[uh]]αi −∇uK−αh · rαh−α ∣∣∣+ |[[uh]]αi |


q

.

Following the proof of lemma 4 and noting that uKαh (xα) − u
Kα
h (xi) = ∇u

Kα
h · rαhα, it can be proved

that this shock detector takes values s ∈ [0, 1] and that sα(xi) = 1 if and only if uh has a local discrete
extremum on xi in the direction rα. Then, if we consider a node xi and an element K ⊂ Ωi, we let ΓKi
be the interval such that if α ∈ ΓKi , Kα = K. It is easy to see that if the function uh has a local discrete
extremum on xi in K then sα(xi) = 1 ∀α ∈ ΓKi . So it is possible to define the elemental shock detector
as:

sK = max
xi∈K

inf
α∈ΓK

i

sα(xi).

Notice that sα(xi) = 1 ∀α ∈ ΓKi does not necessarily imply that there is a local discrete extremum on xi
in K. This property is natural, since local instabilities can appear on nodes that are not local discrete
extrema, e.g., on shock fronts.

On the other hand, given the cost of computing infα∈ΓK
i
s(xαi ), we can avoid its computation by

taking the minimum with respect to edge directions only (at both sides of the edge). This simplification
leads to a very slightly different method, but the simplified definition still enjoys the property that
sK = 1 if uh has a local discrete extremum in K.

Remark 4. We have designed a shock detector that ensures that there is the maximum amount of
viscosity around a local discrete extremum. However, it is unclear how to prove the DMP for the
multidimensional case, since it is not even available for the Laplacian problem. (It is due to the sign
of the IP term, that cannot be determined.) In any case, looking at the results in Section 7, the DMP
holds in practice for the same mesh conditions stated in [2].

7. Numerical results

For the following test, if nothing is said, the value of the parameters used will be q = 10, cip = 10
and ν = 0.5. The choice of the last two parameters is explained in the first numerical experiment.

7.1. Sharpness of the parameters

In order to check if the choice of the parameters is sharp, we will solve the problem:

−0.01uxx + ux = 0 in Ω = (0, 1)

u(0) = 0
u(1) = 1

using a mesh of N = 10 elements. The solution of the problem presents a sharp slope near the boundary
x = 1. The solution with N = 1000 is plotted as a reference solution. Let us check the sharpness of the
bound for ν such that the formulation satisfies a DMP (see Theorem 5). In previous works, using similar
schemes with continuous finite element methods (see [2, 4]) the condition for the method to enjoy a
DMP was ν ≥ 0.5. In this case, if we look at the proof of Theorem 5, and assuming that µ < ‖β‖h, we
can sharpen the value of ν to be ν > 0.5 +µ‖β‖−1h−1 (instead of ν > 1 as stated in the theorem) which
in this particular case means ν > 0.55. But, when varying the values of ν and testing the violation of
the DMP, we observed that the threshold is still on ν = 0.5 as it can be observed in Fig. 2. For ν = 0.49
the DMP is violated while for ν = 0.5 the violation is in the order of the machine precision. For this
reason, for the next tests we will use the value ν = 0.5. The results plotted in Fig. 2 are obtained using
cip = 10.

It is also possible to see how different choices of the parameter ξ lead to a violation of the DMP. We
recall that ξ could take values {0, 0.5, 1}, corresponding to the symmetric, incomplete, and nonsymmetric
scheme. Without weighting, our analysis works for the incomplete scheme only, and, as it can be checked
in Fig. 3(a), this is the only scheme that ensures the DMP. Finally, we vary the value of cip. Theorem
5 states that cip > 0.5 for the method to enjoy the DMP, but the method still satisfies the DMP for
cip = 0.4 (see Fig. 3(b)). In any case, we prefer the use of cip = 10 which is common in the literature.

As it was proved in the Corollary 6, it is possible to consider a weighted symmetric/antisymmetric IP
formulation by weighting the value of ξ with the shock detector. The results obtained with such method
are plotted in Fig. 4. It can be appreciated how the DMP is effectively enjoyed by all the methods,
being the incomplete the most accurate one. Moreover, the nonlinear convergence is much faster in the
incomplete case since the weighting introduce extra nonlinearity to the problem.

The next problem is a 1D first-order diferential equation (µ = 0) inspired by the numerical example
in [15]:

, in Ω = (0, 1), (15)

with u(0) = 0. The solution to this problem is u = 0.5 (tanh ((x− 0.5)/�) + 1); it shows a sharp layer
around x = 0.5. Since the source is positive in the whole domain, we expect the stabilized method not
to have any local discrete minimum in Ω. In Fig. 5(a), it can be appreciated how the DMP is violated
for the IP dG method without extra viscosity while it is not when the appropiate viscosity is added.
Moreover the layer is captured with the same amount of elements in both cases, so the method is not
too much diffusive.

7.3. Convergence of a smooth solution

We would like to see that the L2 convergence of the method towards an smooth solution is not
affected by the activation of the AV. To test so, we consider the equation (1) with µ = 0, β = (1, 1),
f(x, y) = cos(2πx) in Ω = [0, 1]2 and boundary conditions on the inflow boundary given by u(x, y) =
sin(2πx), which is the exact solution. Since this solution presents maxima and minima in the x direction
on the lines x = 0.25 and x = 0.75, the shock detector is activated and AV is added. The problem is
solved in triangular meshes of Nh × Nh(×2) elements with size Nh = 12, 24, 48, 96, 192. Even though
the presence of the AV increases the error in L2(Ω) norm (as expected), the convergence of order 2 is
maintained, as it can be appreciated in Fig. 5(b)

7.4. Propagation of discontinuities

A typical steady-state test is to study the propagation of a boundary discontinuity for a convection-
dominated equation. To do so, problem (11) is solved in Ω = [0, 1]2 with µ = 10−8, β =
(cos(−π/3), sin(−π/3)), f = 0 and the boundary conditions g = 1 on y = 1 and on {x = 0} ∩ {y ≥ 0.7}
and g = 0 on the rest of the boundary. The solution of this problem has two boundary layers (on x = 1
and y = 0) and an interior layer of width proportional to the value of µ. The mesh used in this case
consists of 48× 48(×2) triangles.

The AV definition depends on the solution, ending up with a nonlinear stabilization term. For
transient problems, it can be considered in a semi-implicit way (taking the value from the previous time
step without nonlinear iterations), but for the steady state case nonlinear iterations are needed. In order
to improve convergence we have used the damping parameter ω ∈ [0.01, 1] proposed in [18]. In any case,

Figure 6: Propagation of a discontinuity. 48× 48(×2) triangular mesh. cip = 10, cbms = 0.5, ν = 0.5

for q = 10, the nonlinear error got stuck in values of order 10−2-10−3. However, the results in Fig. 6(b)
are very good, with a violation of the DMP of order 10−3, clearly damping the initial sharp oscillations
obtained by the original method (see Fig. 6(a)).

This nonconvergence problem is common to AV due to the fact that, for high values of q, the shock
detector values are almost binary (very close to 0 or 1) and the activation and deactivation of the shock
detector s may become cyclic. That is what happens in this case when using q = 10.

This behavior is explained by the fact that, even though the shock capturing term proposed herein
is Lipschitz continuous, the Lipschitz constant blows up as q → ∞. However, a main difference with
respect to the popular non-differentiable flux correction transport schemes (see [19]) is that we can
control this Lipschitz constant by decreasing the value of q. As an example, taking q = 10ω ( we
recall that ω ∈ [0.01, 1] is the damping parameter used to improve the nonlinear convergence and it is
recalculated in each iteration), it is possible to converge with tolerance 10−8 with respect to the norm of
the increment between iterations. In this last case we have lost accuracy in order to improve nonlinear
convergence, but the method does fulfil the DMP exactly. The drawback of reducing q are less sharp
fronts. In fact, in the limit case q = 0 we recover the sub-optimal Von Neumann-Richtmyer isotropic AV
in the whole domain (see Fig. 6(c)). Ellaborated q-adaptive nonlinear algorithms could be considered,
based on these observations.

7.5. Multidimensional transport problem

Finally, a pure convection problem will be used in order to show the performance of the method; let
us note that the present numerical analysis does apply for the case µ = 0. The test consists in solving the
two dimensional transport problem ∂tu+∇· (βu) = 0 in [0, 1]2× [0, T ], β = (−2π(y− 0.5), 2π(x− 0.5)).
The solution of this equation is a displacement of the initial solution around the center of the square.
The solution is computed at T = 1 after a complete cycle. The initial solution is given in [21] and its
interpolation in a mesh of 250× 250 bilinear elements is displayed in Fig. 7(a).

The solution is discretised with a 100 × 100(×2) triangular mesh and the integration in time is
performed using Crank-Nicolson with time step ∆t = 2.5 · 10−4 and without mass lumping. The result
can be compared with the original dG method and also with the results obtained in a finer mesh in
the continuous case, using a similar shock capturing designed in [2] and denoted as boundary gradient
jump viscosity (bGJV). If the reader is interested in comparing the results with some other state-of-art
methods, like residual-based and entropy-viscosity methods, we refer to [2], where the results for the
same tests are provided.

For the continuous case, the mesh consists of 250× 250(×2) elements and more than 60, 000 nodes,
which is the number of nodes of the discontinuous case. The AV is computed semi-implicitly. The results

are displayed in Fig. 8 and it can be observed that, in comparison with the original result, the AV does a
good job removing the oscillations on the top of the cylinder. On the other hand, it damps the solution
around the top of the cone and the hump by activating unnecessarily the viscosity. This problem is
avoided by refining the mesh as it is the case for the continuous method (see Fig. 8(d)).

The L2 error after one cycle has been computed in 4 different regions, namely Ω1, Ω2, Ω3, Ω4,
corresponding to the ones plotted in Fig. 7(b). The first three regions correspond to the elements of
the mesh such that the centroid of their Gauss points are at distance 2 · 10−2 or less to a discontinuity
or change of gradient of the exact solution. The region Ω4 is simply the rest of the domain.

The results reported in Fig. 8 are at the final stage of the computation, i.e., t = 1, and the oscilla-
tions have already been smoothed out. In order to better evaluate how the different methods succeed
eliminating oscillations, we introduce the oscillation function

osc(t) = max
(x,y)∈Ω

{0, uh(x, y, t)− 1,−uh(x, y, t)} .

We compute the mean value of the parameter osc(t) in bunches of 50 time steps and the time evolution
of this quantity for the different methods is plotted in Fig. 9. Clearly, the nonlinearly stabilized dG
formulation defined herein beats by far the other two methods in terms of DMP violation; after the first
50 steps the method has already reduced the oscillation below 10−3.

8. Conclusions

When considering dG methods for steady problems or transient problems via (semi-)implicit time
integration, the use of traditional limiting techniques is not suitable in many instances. In this work, we
propose dG formulations that satisfy some kind of monotonicity properties based on implicit nonlinear
stabilization (AV-type terms). The analysis of monotonicity properties and discrete maximum principles
in the frame of dG formulations (without additional postprocessing) is a quite unexplored area; as far
as we know there are only some attempts to prove a DMP for the Laplacian problem in 1D (see [17]).
For this reason, we have started our work defining the notion of local discrete extrema in dG; since

the numerical solution is discontinuous on nodes, this concept is somehow open. Next, we propose a
definition of DMP property for dG, and show that when the dG formulation enjoys this property, the
maximum/minimum is on the boundary (given a negative/positive forcing term) for steady problems in
the multidimensional case. Further, the method is LED for transient problems. Further we show that
for the 1D Poisson problem, the incomplete IP dG formulation satisfies the DMP property. In order to
make symmetric/antisymmetric IP versions to enjoy the DMP, a weighted version of these formulations
is also proposed.

Next, we tackle convection-diffusion and transport problems. The dG formulation we consider is the
IP method (see [1, 17]) for the viscosity term together with the advection stabilization proposed in [3].
On top of this dG formulation, we add a novel nonlinear stabilization (shock capturing) term, based
on jumps of the unknown and its derivatives. As soon as the dG discretization of the Laplacian term
satisfies the DMP (see above), we prove that the resulting dG method also satisfies the DMP property
in 1D. It implies no overshoots/undershoots around sharp layers or discontinuities.

The formulation is extended to multi-dimensional problems, and applied to different test problems.
Out of these results, we show that we have the monotonic properties predicted by the theory in 1D.
In multi-dimension, the method does an excellent job reducing local oscillations, as expected. For time-
dependent problems, we have considered semi-implicit formulations (computing the AV with the solution
of the previous time step). As other shock capturing techniques, when the shock sensor is very sensitive,
i.e., it acts in an almost binary fashion, nonlinear convergence is hard to get. However, the definition of
the shock-capturing proposed herein includes a numerical parameter, q, that allows one to control the
Lipschitz constant, improving nonlinear convergence by reducing q.
