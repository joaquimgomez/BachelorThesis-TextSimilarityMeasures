Multiscale Computational Homogenization. Review and
Proposal of a New Enhanced-First-Order Method

Fermin Otero · Sergio Oller · Xavier Martinez

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract The continuous increase of computational

capacity has encouraged the extensive use of multiscale

techniques to simulate the material behaviour on sev-

eral fields of knowledge. In solid mechanics, the mul-

tiscale approaches which consider the macro-scale de-

formation gradient to obtain the homogenized mate-

rial behaviour from the micro-scale are called first-order

computational homogenization. Following this idea, the

second-order FE2 methods incorporate high-order gra-

dients to improve the simulation accuracy. However, to

capture the full advantages of these high-order frame-

work the classical Boundary Value Problem (BVP) at

the macro-scale must be upgraded to high-order level,

which complicates their numerical solution. With the

purpose of obtaining the best of both methods i.e. first-

order and second-order, in this work an enhanced-first-

order computational homogenization is presented. The

proposed approach preserves a classical BVP at the

macro-scale level but taking into account the high-order

gradient of the macro-scale in the micro-scale solution.

The developed numerical examples show how the pro-

posed method obtains the expected stress distribution

at the micro-scale for states of structural bending loads.

Nevertheless, the macro-scale results achieved are the

same than the ones obtained with a first-order frame-

work because both approaches share the same macro-

scale BVP.

1 Introduction

Almost all existing materials around us can be consid-

ered heterogeneous structures or composite materials,

since they are composed by several phases or compo-

nents at certain spatial scale of observation. Prediction

of the physical and chemical behaviour of such materi-

als is a complicated target. Their properties, also called

effective or homogenized properties, fully depend on the

internal microstructure which can be different from one

to another composite in morphology, volume fraction,

and of course, in properties of constituents. The interac-

tion between components, failure of interfaces capacity

or damage because of fracture of the constituents must

be also considered. Therefore, obtaining a good charac-

terization of composite materials behaviour is in general

a complex issue and requires considering suitable and

sophisticated methods.

1.1 Review of multiscale methods

Within the context of solid mechanics, the pioneering

works of Eshelby [21], Hashin [39], Hashin and Shtrik-

man [40, 41], Hill [43, 44, 45, 46], Budiansky [10], Man-

del [69] and Gurson [38] have been significant theo-

retical developments for the estimation of macroscopic

properties of heterogeneous materials. Following in time,



2 F. Otero et al.

the asymptotic homogenization theory has been an-

other important milestone for modelling multiphase ma-

terials. The method is based on asymptotic expansions

of displacement, strain and stress fields around their

corresponding macroscopic values. Through variational

principles is obtained a set of boundary value problems.

Fundamental contributions to this modelling method-

ology are the original works of Bensoussan et al. [7]

and Sanchez-Palencia [102, 103]. Fish and co-workers

presented a generalization of the mathematical homog-

enization method based on double-scale asymptotic ex-

pansion to account for non-linear effects such as plastic-

ity [28] and damage [29] in heterogeneous media. The

asymptotic homogenization method was continuously

developed and nowadays, it still is a very popular re-

search topic [12, 52, 15, 18, 119].

In the last decade, several multiscale approaches

have been developed becoming nowadays in an essential

technique for modelling composites materials. This is

because, even today performing a full direct numerical

simulation including all the heterogeneities leads to a

huge problem, which is expensive and unworkable from

a computational cost point of view. On the other hand,

carrying out numerous experiments on many material

samples with different geometrical and physical proper-

ties is practically impossible because of time and cost.

In a general sense, it is possible classify the mul-

tiscale models into the concurrent method [9, 85, 63,

32, 33, 48, 27, 118, 68, 127, 20] and the homogeniza-

tion method, on the latter one will be focused this ar-

ticle. The main feature of a generic concurrent multi-

scale method is that coarse- and fine-scale regions are

processed simultaneously. The links between different

scales are accounted considering displacement compat-

ibility and momentum balance across the whole solid.

Therefore, this framework considers a strong coupling

between the scales. On the other hand, the multiscale

homogenization method is based on the principle of

separation of scales and then, micro-scale length is as-

sumed much smaller than macro-scale length [31]. Con-

sequently, in this approach the length scales of micro-

and macro-problems must be sufficiently separate.

Multiscale homogenization method which uses the

concept of Representative Volume Element (RVE) [43,

7, 115, 111, 108] together with suitable computational

approaches has emerged as one of the most promis-

ing formulation to address the response of composites

structures. The RVE is employed to determine the ho-

mogenized properties and behaviour of a material point

at the macro-scale level. It is defined as a microstruc-

tural subregion and must be large enough to be statisti-

cally representative of the composite material including

all its microscopic heterogeneities [19, 123, 91, 53, 34,

72]. However, it must remain sufficiently small to be

considered as a volume element of the structure, fulfill

space separation condition and also due to computa-

tional efficiency [92, 121].

Renard and Marmonier [101] were the firsts to use

a finite element discretization to model heterogeneous

materials with a homogenization method. The geome-

try of the RVE is meshed with finite elements to solve

the micro-scale Boundary Value Problem (BVP), then

through homogenization rules the micro-results are linked

to macro-scale properties [123, 107, 36, 64, 35]. Guedes

and Kikuchi [37] extended the method to analyze the

mechanical behavior of linear elastic 2D and 3D com-

posite materials with periodic microstructure. However,

who introduced the general formulation of FE2 was

Feyel [23]. The structure at the macro-scale is discretized

by finite elements and for each integration points of the

macro-element one RVE also discretized by finite ele-

ments is assigned. The coupled problem between both

scale are computationally performed by solving sepa-

rate BVPs through the finite element method. During

subsequent years, the FE2 computational technique has

been further developed in the works of many authors

[110, 59, 122, 74, 75, 77, 70, 105].

The recent reviews of Kanouté et al. [55], Geers et

al. [31], McDowell [71] and Nguyen et al. [84] show that

the computational multiscale methods have a clear po-

tential to encourage important advances in modelling

material non-linear behaviour e.g. viscoelasticity, plas-

ticity, material fracture and among others. Because in

general, the non-linear processes are the result of many

complex mechanisms at the micro-scale level which de-

pend of the specific analyzed material. Since the pio-

neering works of Swan [116], Smit et al. [110], Michel

et al. [73], Miehe et al. [76] and Nemat-Nasser [82] many

developments have been done on this issue for several

authors [117, 26, 59, 25, 124, 90, 16, 49, 58].

One of the main challenges for computational mul-

tiscale formulations is the objectivity i.e. energy consis-

tency and mesh/RVE-size independence [3]. The dissi-

pated energy by the failure mechanisms must be con-

sistent through the scales and, unaffected by RVE size

[34] and convergent with mesh refinement. To overcome

the inherent non-objective of classical multiscale com-

putational homogenization due to size-effect associated

with strain localization at the micro-scale several tech-

niques have been developed. For instance, the Multi-

scale Aggregating Discontinuities (MAD) was proposed

by Belytschko et al. [5], the strategy is based on ag-

gregating discontinuities at the micro-scale and passing

these to the macro-scale [113, 4]. In [89], the Contin-

uum Strong Discontinuity Approach (CSDA) proposed

by Oliver and Huespe [86, 88, 87] is extended to two-



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 3

scale modeling of propagating fracture. In general, these

strategies introduced in the formulation a characteristic

length as a numerical parameter which is coming from

the RVE domain size e.g. the finite element size [94], the

bandwidth of crack [126] or the bandwidth of cohesive

zone [89]. In addition, computational homogenization

schemes using a gradient-enhanced to connect the scales

were developed [60, 114, 62, 66, 67, 51], in these kind of

approaches it is not necessary to introduce artificially a

length-scale parameter because it arrives naturally. Co-

enen et al. developed an enhanced multi-scale scheme

by introducing discontinuities to simulate the strain lo-

calization band [14]. The same authors propose a new

type of boundary condition at the micro-scale to im-

prove capture the developing localization bands [13].

It is known that computational multiscale homog-

enization techniques are computationally expensive for

non-linear analysis because the micro-scale problem needs

to be solved many times. However, the multiscale ho-

mogenization solution is easily parallelizable due to the

fact that the different micro-scale BVPs are indepen-

dent of each other [24, 70, 81]. In addition, several re-

cent contributions have been presented aiming at im-

proving the robustness and reducing the computational

cost e.g. adaptive strategies to solve the micro-scale

problem only the minimum number of times necessary

[126, 94], adaptive sub-incremental strategies to ensure

the convergence of the multiscale solution in the pres-

ence of several sources of non-linearity [112, 100], model-

order reduction techniques [129, 80, 65, 42] which use

the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), or proper

generalized decomposition, to obtain the reduced set of

empirical shape functions.

In the last years, multiphysics problems have been

addressed using multiscale homogenization methods, such

as [96, 125, 120, 8] for thermomechanical problems,

[50, 11] for magnetomechanical problems, [104, 57, 79]

for electromechanical problems, among others. On the

other hand, after the groundbreaking contribution of

Bendsoe and Kikuchi [6] in which the homogenization

method is used to design optimal topology structures

several authors have dabbled into this actual research

topic [1, 106, 128, 56, 22].

1.2 Formulation introduction

In the context of solid mechanics and multiscale com-

putational homogenization, one of the most extended

and popular method is called First-Order Computa-

tional Homogenization (FOCH) [73, 123, 74]. In this

approach, the macro-scale strain tensor (or deformation

gradient tensor) is used as input to solve the micro-scale

BVP. The material stress-strain relationship is obtained

from the solution of problem at the micro-scale i.e. the

RVE which contains the detailed modeling of the inter-

nal heterogeneous structure of the composite. There-

fore, it does not require any composite constitutive as-

sumption or compatibility equation to address the com-

posite response [95]. And, there are not restriction on

the constitutive model used in the component mate-

rials, even non-linear materials and time-dependency

models can be taken into account [110, 90, 94].

In the last decade, a Second-Order Computational

Homogenization (SOCH) was proposed as a natural ex-

tension of the FOCH [60, 62, 51]. It was developed to

be applied in critical regions of large gradient deforma-

tion, where the characteristic wave length of the macro-

scale deformation field is of the order of the size of the

micro-scale. In this method the macroscopic gradient

of the deformation gradient is also incorporated as in-

put in the micro-scale BVP. The first-order equilibrium

problem is conserved at the micro-scale level, while a

higher-order equilibrium problem appears at the struc-

tural scale. The finite element framework necessary for

the numerical solution of the macro-scale problem leads

to many complications [61], which has restricted its ex-

tensive applicability.

The SOCH is able to capture the second-order ef-

fects in the microscopic scale due to macroscopic high-

order phenomena such as bending or strain localiza-

tion, this is its major improvement over the FOCH.

However, the FOCH conserves first-order equilibrium

equations at both scales, which represents an advan-

tage from a computational point of view. With the pur-

pose to take the best of these two methods, the pre-

sented work proposes an Enhanced-First-Order Com-

putational Homogenization (EFOCH). The developed

procedure takes into account macroscopic second-order

effects by using the macro-scale second-order deforma-

tion measure in the micro-scale BVP. Besides, the pro-

posed EFOCH conserves the classical first-order equi-

librium problem in the structural scale.

In the following, the classical FOCH is reviewed,

as it is the most common procedure used in mechan-

ical multiscale analysis. The description of the FOCH

theory will be used to set the theoretical framework

of homogenization procedures. Afterwards, Section 3

presents the proposed EFOCH, together with some re-

marks regarding the differences found with the SOCH

proposed and used by other authors. In Section 4 the

BVPs for both scales and some considerations about

the numerical implementation are described. Section 5

contains the numerical examples used to compare the

results obtained with the proposed EFOCH and FOCH.

Finally in last section the conclusions of this work are

exposed.

2 General considerations and FOCH

The no lineal transformation between the reference con-

figuration of the body Ω and the current configura-

tion of the same body Ωc is defined as: φ : Ω → Ωc |
x = φ (X), where x ∈ Ωc and X ∈ Ω are respectively
the current and the reference positions of the material

point. Therefore, the linear mapping for an infinitesimal

material line element is

dx = F · dX, (1)

where the deformation gradient tensor is defined by

F =
∂φ

∂X
= ∇x. (2)

Here, the gradient operator ∇(·) is taken respect to the
reference configuration X.

Nevertheless, if now a finite material line within a

finite volume is considered, the expression given by (1)

does not apply any more. However, a Taylor series ex-

pansion (centered at Xo) can be used to obtain an ex-

pression for the finite material line 4x in the current
configuration as

4x = F (Xo) · 4X +
1

2
G (Xo) : 4X �4X

+ O

)
, (3)

where the third-order tensor G is the gradient of the

deformation gradient, which can be defined as

G =
∂

∂X

(
∂φ

∂X

)
= ∇F. (4)

It can be shown from (4) that the tensor G has the

symmetry property of Gijk = Gikj [60].

2.1 First-order computational homogenization

Let us consider a solid domain (or body Ω) with a peri-

odic or quasi-periodic microstructure that can be repre-

sented by a RVE. In this body, it is possible to establish

two scale levels, a macro scale (or structural scale) for

the macrostructure, and a micro scale (or sub scale) for

the microstructure. The microstructural scale is defined

using a RVE which characterizes the microstructure of

the material. Let us also consider an infinitesimal ma-

terial point Xo in the reference configuration of the

structure, and the RVE around this considered point

as Figure 1 is showing.

The called principle of separation of scales [31] es-

tablishes that: the microstructural length scale lµ is as-

sumed to be much smaller than the macrostructural

characteristic length l, which is the length over the

Fig. 1 Macrostructure and microstructure around of the
point Xo

macroscopic space. In other words, the principle says

that the existing periodical microscopic dimension around

of the macrostructural point (Xo) must be smaller than

the characteristic macrostructural dimension. If this prin-

ciple is satisfied, the current configuration or deformed

position of a material point in the RVE xµ ∈ Ωcµ can
be approximated as

xµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= xoµ + F (Xo) · 4Xµ + w (Xµ) , (5)

where 4Xµ = Xµ − Xoµ, and Xµ ∈ Ωµ is the refer-
ence configuration or non-deformed position of the ma-

terial point in the RVE and Xoµ and x
o
µ are the origin

of the reference and the current coordinate system on

the RVE, respectively (see Figure 2). The extra term w

is a microstructural displacement fluctuation field.

To simplify the symbolic manipulation of the for-

mulation is convenient to set the coordinate system’s
origin as

Xoµ = 0 and x
o
µ = 0. (6)

Later, it will be proved that with these values, the rigid

body motion of the RVE is avoided. Considering these

restrictions, the expression given by (5) can be rewrit-

ten as

xµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= F (Xo) ·Xµ + w (Xµ) . (7)

2.1.1 Displacement field on the RVE

The displacement field uµ at the RVE is defined by

uµ = xµ −Xµ, (8)

and taking into account (7) in the previous equation,

uµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= [F (Xo)− I] ·Xµ + w (Xµ) , (9)

where I is the second-order unit tensor.

2.1.2 Kinematically admissible displacement fields and

boundary conditions

The displacement fields in the RVE that are kinemat-

ically admissible are obtained as a result of the cou-

pling between the macrostructure and the microstruc-

ture. This linkage is based on the average theorems and

they have been initially proposed for infinitesimal defor-

mations by Hill [43]. Later, Hill [47] and Nemat-Nasser

[83] extended these to finite deformations.

The first of the averaging relations postulates that

the volume average of the microstructural deformation

gradient tensor Fµ over the RVE must be equal to the

macroscopic F. In the considered point Xo this is

F (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Fµ (Xo,Xµ) dV, (10)

where Vµ is the volume of the RVE in the reference

configuration.

Considering (7) it is possible to write Fµ as

Fµ (Xo,Xµ) = ∇xµ (Xo,Xµ)
∼= F (Xo) +∇w (Xµ) , (11)

and using this relation, the right hand size of (10) is

Equation (12) can be rewritten as

Fig. 3 Normal vectors to the surfaces in the reference con-
figuration of a Cubic RVE

Finally, applying the divergence theorem, in the right

hand size of (14), this can be also rewritten in term of

surface integral as

F (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
∂Ωµ

xµ (Xo,Xµ) � N dA

−

Vµ

∫
∂Ωµ

w (Xµ) � N dA, (15)

where ∂Ωµ is the RVE boundary domain in the ref-

erence configuration, and N denotes the outward unit

normal on ∂Ωµ.

Clearly, to satisfy the first average theorem, the in-

tegrals that depend of the displacement fluctuation in

both (14) and (15) must vanish. Therefore,∫
Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) dV = 0 (16)

and∫
∂Ωµ

w (Xµ) � N dA = 0. (17)

Noting Fig. 2 and considering that the reference ge-

ometry configuration of the RVE is originally a cube,

as the figure is showing, the integral restriction on the

RVE boundary can be splitted in the different surfaces

of the ∂Ωµ domain. Besides, taking the reference co-

ordinate system that is shown in Fig. 3, the outward

unit normal of the cubic faces satisfy: N−X = −N
+

N−Y = −N

−
Z = −N

+
Z . Here, the subscript

makes reference to the axis which is perpendicular to

the considered face and the superscript defines the posi-

tion of the face on the axis. Therefore, considering this

geometry, the expression given by (17) may be rewrit-

ten as∑

(∫

∫

� N+i = 0 (18)



6 F. Otero et al.

Equation (18) shows that the boundary restriction

on the displacement fluctuation field can be splitted on

the different surface pairs (X, Y and Z) of the RVE

boundary.

Previous equations from (16) to (18) can be used

to obtain the different displacement fluctuation fields

kinematically admissible in the microstructural level.

Several models have been defined that assume different

fluctuation fields:

i Taylor model (or zero fluctuations): The expression

given by (16) is verified when

w, sufficiently regular | w (Xµ) = 0,
∀ Xµ ∈ Ωµ. (19)

This model gives homogeneous deformation in the

microstructural scale level (see (24)).

ii Linear boundary displacements (or zero boundary

fluctuations): The expression given by (17) is veri-

fied when

w, sufficiently regular | w (Xµ) = 0,
∀ Xµ ∈ ∂Ωµ. (20)

The deformation of the RVE boundary domain for

this class are fully prescribed.

iii Periodic boundary fluctuations: The key kinemati-

cal constraint for this class is that w must be peri-

odic on the different faces of the RVE. That is, for

each pair
{
X+µ ,X

−
µ

}
of boundary points the expres-

sion given by (18) is verified when

w, suff. reg. | w
(
X+µ
)

= w
(
X−µ
)
,

∀ pairs
{
X+µ ,X

−
µ

}
∈ ∂Ωµ. (21)

iv Minimal constraint (or uniform boundary traction):

In this constraint the nontrivial solution of (17) is

obtained.

2.1.3 Microscopic and macroscopic strain tensor

Considering a infinitesimal deformation framework the

strain tensor in the microstructural level can be ob-

tained as

Eµ (Xo,Xµ) =
1

2

(
Fµ (Xo,Xµ) + F

T
µ (Xo,Xµ)

)
− I

=
1

2

(
F (Xo) + F

T (Xo)
)
− I

+
1

2

(
∇w (Xµ) + (∇w (Xµ))

T
)
, (22)

and, if (10) is satisfied it can be proved that taking

the volume average of Eµ over the RVE domain the

following relationship is obtained,

1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Eµ (Xo,Xµ) dV

=
1

2

(
F (Xo) + F

T (Xo)
)
− I = E (Xo) . (23)

Here, E (Xo) is the macroscopic strain tensor. It is pos-

sible to rewrite (22) as

Eµ (Xo,Xµ) = E (Xo) + E
w
µ (Xµ) , (24)

where Ewµ =
1
2

(
∇w + (∇w)T

)
= ∇sw is the contri-

bution of w to the microscopic strain tensor and ∇s is
the symmetric gradient operator. Because (10) is veri-

fied the volume average of Ewµ over the RVE domain is

equal to zero.

2.1.4 Hill-Mandel principle and RVE equilibrium

The Hill-Mandel energy condition [44, 69], also referred

to as the macro-homogeneity condition, states that the

virtual work of the point Xo considered must be equal

to the volume average of the virtual work in the RVE

to any kinematically admissible displacement field, this

principle can be formulated as

S : δE (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Sµ : δEµ dV, (25)

where S and Sµ are the macroscopic and microscopic

stress tensor, respectively.

Using (24), the principle is rewritten as

S : δE (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Sµ dV : δE (Xo)

+
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Sµ : δE
w
µ (Xµ) dV. (26)

Taking S as the volume average of Sµ in the RVE do-

main, which is similar to the first average relation (see

(10))

S (Xo,Xµ) ≡
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Sµ (Xo,Xµ) dV, (27)

equation (26) will be satisfied if∫

Sµ : ∇sδw dV = 0. (28)

Therefore, the RVE’s variational equilibrium equation

is∫
Ωµ

Sµ : ∇sδw dV = 0, (29)



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 7

which must be satisfied for any kinematically admissible

w (see Section 2.1.2).

It is possible to observe that because of the symme-

try of Sµ it can be proved that Sµ : (∇a) = Sµ : (∇a)
T

,

where a is a first-order tensor, equation (28) also can

be rewritten as

∫

Sµ : δE

2.1.5 Microscopic and macroscopic stress tensor

The microscopic stress tensor can be obtained as

Sµ (Xo,Xµ) = Cµ (Xµ) : Eµ (Xo,Xµ)

= Cµ (Xµ) : E (Xo) + Cµ (Xµ) : E
w
µ (Xµ) , (31)

where Cµ is the material constitutive tensor in the

RVE. Then, using (27) the macroscopic stress tensor

is

where,

is a constitutive tensor, which can be considered a ma-

terial property.

Equation (32) shows that S depends of E and also

of Ewµ . Moreover, Xµ does not appear explicitly in E

µ

expression (see (24)) and, consequently, Xµ does not

appear in Sµ either. This implies that, the periodic

microstructure around the macro point Xo does not

have to be modeled with its exact dimensions. A non-

dimensional RVE with the internal distribution and vol-

ume fractions of the simple materials is enough to ob-

tain the microscopic strain and stress fields.

On the other hand, the kinematically admissible dis-

placement fluctuation option used to satisfy the bound-

ary condition affects the final S obtained, as occurs in

the Taylor model case. This means that if there is a null

displacement fluctuation field in the total RVE domain,

the S obtained only depend of E and C̄. In other words,

the Taylor model condition returns the classical mixing

theory results.

3 Enhanced-first-order computational

homogenization

In the following, an Enhanced-First-Order Computa-

tional Homogenization (EFOCH) is proposed with the

main objective to include in the RVE the second-order

effects obtained from a macroscopic high-order phe-

nomena. Unlike the SOCH, the presented EFOCH pre-

serves a classical first-order BVP at the macro scale

level as does the FOCH.

If the principle of separation of scales is not clearly

satisfied, the microscopic displacement field can be en-

riched with second-order information available in the

macro scale. The deformed position of a material point

in the RVE (see (5)), can be rewritten with the second-

order term of (3). Then, it is possible to propose a new

approximation of the current configuration as

xµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= xcµ + F (Xo) · 4Xµ

+
1

2
G (Xo) : 4Xµ �4Xµ + w (Xµ) , (34)

and setting the coordinate system’s origin as defined in

(6), the proposed deformed position of the RVE is

xµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= F (Xo) ·Xµ

+
1

2
G (Xo) : Xµ � Xµ + w (Xµ) . (35)

And the proposed displacement field uµ on the RVE

(see (8)) can be obtained now as

uµ (Xo,Xµ) ∼= [F (Xo)− I] ·Xµ

+
1

2
G (Xo) : Xµ � Xµ + w (Xµ) . (36)

Noting that an extra term appears by including G in

(34). This extra second-order term is a new linking term

between the macroscopic and microscopic scales.

3.1 Kinematically admissible displacement fields and

boundary conditions

The first of the average postulates (see (10)) is used

again to obtain the admissible displacement fields. The

microscopic deformation gradient considering the ex-

pression given by (35) is

Fµ (Xo,Xµ) = ∇xµ (Xo,Xµ)
∼= F (Xo) + G (Xo) ·Xµ +∇w (Xµ) . (37)



8 F. Otero et al.

And, the volume average of Fµ over the RVE is

1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Fµ (Xo,Xµ) dV =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

∇xµ (Xo,Xµ) dV

= F (Xo) + G (Xo) ·
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Xµ dV

+
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) dV. (38)

It can be proved that if the RVE geometry in the ref-

erence configuration is originally a cube, as shown in

Fig. 2, and the position of the origin of the coordinate

system is defined at the center of the RVE, then the

first moment of volume of the RVE is∫
Ωµ

Xµ dV = 0. (39)

Therefore, (38) can be rewritten as (13) or (14), and the

restrictions on w are the same than the one obtained

for the FOCH, which are shown in (16)-(18). The fields

kinematically admissible w presented in Section 2.1.2

are still valid for the proposed EFOCH.

3.1.1 Extra kinematic restrictions and boundary

conditions

The next step consists in obtaining the kinematic re-

strictions result of including the new term G in uµ. In

other words, some extension of the first average the-

orem needs to be proposed in term of G. In the fol-

lowing, a natural extension for the first average theo-

rem is presented. The main drawback of this proposal is

that leads to restrictions on the derivative displacement

fluctuation field and therefore, a high-order problem on

the RVE must be considered. To avoid this situation,

and in order to continue using the classical first-order

BVP on the RVE, the alternative extension proposed

by Kouznetsova [60] is also shown.

Natural extension of the first average theorem The first

natural possibility for this extension could be

G (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Gµ (Xo,Xµ) dV. (40)

Note that (40) is similar to (10) but in this case, the

volume average of Gµ over the RVE must be equal to

G in the considered point Xo.

Considering (37) and (4), Gµ can be written as

Gµ (Xo,Xµ) = ∇ (∇xµ (Xo,Xµ))
∼= G (Xo) +∇ (∇w (Xµ)) . (41)

Using (41) and taking the volume average over the RVE

it is possible to obtain

G (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Gµ (Xo,Xµ) dV

−
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

∇ (∇w (Xµ)) dV, (42)

or

G (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

∇ (∇xµ (Xo,Xµ)) dV

−
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

∇ (∇w (Xµ)) dV. (43)

And, applying the divergence theorem in the last ex-

pression

G (Xo) =
1

Vµ

∫
∂Ωµ

∇xµ (Xo,Xµ) � N dA

−
1

Vµ

∫
∂Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) � N dA. (44)

Similarly as in FOCH, to satisfy the proposed extension

of the first average theorem, the integrals that depend

of the displacement fluctuation in (42) and (44) must

vanish, then∫
Ωµ

∇ (∇w (Xµ)) dV = 0, (45)

and∫
∂Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) � N dA = 0. (46)

The last expression represents an extra integral restric-

tion on the derivative displacement fluctuation field.

Taking the same consideration than before regarding

the geometry of the RVE (see Fig. 3), the boundary

integration in (46) can be splitted in

∑
i=X,Y,Z

(∫
N

+
i

∇w dA−
∫
N
−
i

∇w dA

)
� N+i = 0. (47)

Some components of the integrals can also be rewrit-

ten in terms of line-boundary integrals applying the di-

vergence theorem. For example, if the first left integral

in the first term in (47) is taken, the line-boundary

of this surface integral can be separated in four differ-

ent lines, two perpendiculars to Y axis, and the other

two perpendiculars to Z axis, as it is shown in Fig. 4.

Because of the RVE geometry considered, these lines

boundary have the property of N−
X|Y = −N

+
X|Y and



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 9

where ∇X represents the derivative with respect to
the X axis. This term cannot be reduced to a line-

integral using the divergence theorem. It can be seen

that when the Periodic boundary fluctuations condition

is the kinematically admissible option used for w on the

RVE, the two right terms on (48) are satisfied directly.

The points on the opposing lines are a pair boundary
points that have the same displacement fluctuation be-

cause of the kinematic condition imposed. Applying this

same procedure to the rest of the terms of expression

(47), this equation can be rewritten as

∑
i=X,Y,Z

(∫
N

+
i

∇iw dA−
∫
N
−
i

∇iwdA

)
�N+i = 0. (49)

The previous expression represents an extra restriction

on the displacement fluctuation field that makes it kine-

matically admissible in the RVE. A possible set of bound-

ary conditions that satisfies this restriction is∫
N

+
i

∇iw dA =
∫
N
−
i

∇iw dA, ∀ i = X,Y, Z (50)

Equation (49) is analogous to (18) but it is written in

terms of derived displacement fluctuation field, in this

case, on the normal direction of the pair surfaces (see

Fig. 3). Therefore, to satisfy any kinematic restriction,

as for example (50), obtained from (49), a high-order

problem on the microscopic scale must be considered

because the restriction of w is written on its derivate.

Alternative extension of the first average theorem An

alternative to the proposed extension of the averag-

ing theorem given by (40) should be found in order to

keep a classical BVP on the microstructural RVE prob-

lem. With this aim Kouznetsova [60] proposed another

extension of the first average theorem. The proposed

condition imposes that the second moment of area of

the deformed RVE, given in terms of the microscopic

displacements, must be equal to the second moment

of area of the RVE expressed in terms of macroscopic

deformation variables [51]. Considering the above, the

expression given by (37) is multiplied by Xµ and inte-

grated over the RVE volume to obtain

∫
Ωµ

∇xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ dV = F (Xo) �
∫
Ωµ

Xµ dV

+ G (Xo) ·
∫
Ωµ

Xµ � Xµ dV

+

∫
Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) � Xµ dV. (51)

Knowing that the first moment of volume of the un-

deformed RVE is zero (see (39)), and defining the sec-

ond moment of volume of the undeformed RVE as J =∫
Ωµ

Xµ � Xµ dV . Equation (51) can be rewritten as

G (Xo) · J =
∫
Ωµ

∇xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ dV

−
∫
Ωµ

∇w (Xµ) � Xµ dV, (52)

replacing the following relationships

∇xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ = ∇ (xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ)
− xµ (Xo,Xµ) � I, (53)

and

∇w (Xµ) � Xµ = ∇ (w (Xµ) � Xµ)−w (Xµ) � I, (54)

it is obtained

G (Xo) · J =
∫
Ωµ

∇ (xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ) dV

−
∫
Ωµ

∇ (w (Xµ) � Xµ) dV −
∫
Ωµ

xµ (Xo,Xµ) dV � I

+

∫
Ωµ

w (Xµ) dV � I. (55)



10 F. Otero et al.

Using (35) it can be shown that∫
Ωµ

xµ (Xo,Xµ) dV � I

=
1

2
G (Xo) : J � I +

∫
Ωµ

w (Xµ) dV � I, (56)

which is used to obtain the final version of the sought

expression

G (Xo) · J +
1

2
G (Xo) : J � I

=

∫
Ωµ

∇ (xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ) dV

−
∫
Ωµ

∇ (w (Xµ) � Xµ) dV, (57)

Applying the divergence theorem on the right hand size

of the equation, it can be rewritten in term of surface

integral as

G (Xo) · J +
1

2
G (Xo) : J � I

=

∫
∂Ωµ

xµ (Xo,Xµ) � Xµ � N dA

−
∫
∂Ωµ

w (Xµ) � Xµ � N dA. (58)

It is possible to make a parallelism between (15)

and (58). The additional condition regarding the second

moment of area of the deformed RVE given by (51)

requires that the influence of w should vanish, then∫
∂Ωµ

w (Xµ) � Xµ � N dA = 0. (59)

Equation (59) is a boundary restriction for w, then it is

not necessary a high-order BVP, at microscopic scale,

to satisfy the new boundary conditions deduced from it.

Considering again the cubic geometry in the reference

configuration defined previously for the RVE (see Fig.

3), the restriction given by (59) can be splitted in the

different surfaces of the domain as

∑
i=X,Y,Z

(∫
N

+
i

w � Xµ dA−
∫
N
−
i

w � Xµ dA

)
�N+i = 0.

(60)

The last expression is used in Section 4.2 to obtain

the BVP on the RVE for the EFOCH. In the case of Pe-

riodic boundary fluctuations condition, it can be proved

that the expression (60) is automatically satisfied if∫
N
−
X

w dAyz = 0 ,

∫
N
−
Y

w dAxz = 0

and

∫
N
−
Z

w dAxy = 0. (61)

Therefore, the extra boundary condition required in

this case is that the integral of the periodic displace-

ment fluctuations on the RVE surfaces must be zero.

It has been shown that in an EFOCH extra bound-

ary conditions must be considered. If the natural exten-

sion of the first average theorem is used (40) extra high-

order conditions (50) are obtained. In consequence, this

kind of boundary conditions require a high-order micro-

scopic BVP. To avoid this situation, in this work will be

used the conditions obtained for the alternative exten-

sion given by (57). Therefore, a first-order microscopic

BVP is conserved in the RVE, as it will be shown in

Section 3.3.

3.2 Microscopic and macroscopic strain tensor

For an infinitesimal deformation approach, Eµ can be

written as

Eµ (Xo,Xµ) =
1
2

(
Fµ (Xo,Xµ) + F

T
µ (Xo,Xµ)

)
− I

T
)

+ 1
2

(
∇w (Xµ) + (∇w (Xµ))

T
)
.

(62)

Knowing that (10) is satisfied and using (39), the re-

sulting expression of the volume average of Eµ over the

RVE domain is the same than (23), which was obtained

previously in Section 2.1.3. Therefore, Eµ can be rewrit-

ten as

Eµ (Xo,Xµ) = E (Xo) +E
G
µ (Xo,Xµ) +E

w
µ (Xµ) , (63)

where EGµ =
1
2

(
G ·Xµ + (G ·Xµ)

T
)

is a new term in

the microscopic strain tensor, resulting from including

the second-order term G in the formulation. Using the

expression given by (39), it can be proved that the vol-

ume average of this new term EGµ over the RVE domain

is equal to zero.

3.3 Hill-Mandel principle and RVE equilibrium

When the second-order of the Taylor series expansion

given by (3) is used to improve the approximation of

the deformed position of a material point in the RVE

(see (34)), it is assumed that exists a macroscopic fi-

nite volume ΩM around the considered point Xo, as it

is shown in Fig. 5. This finite volume must be smaller



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 11

Fig. 5 Macro volume ΩM around point Xo and its micro

than the characteristic macroscopic dimension. There-

fore, the Hill-Mandel principle [44, 69] should be ap-

plied now, not only taking into account the virtual work

of the point Xo, but considering the volume average of

the virtual work in the macro volume ΩM . This can be

stated as

∫
ΩM

S : δE dV =

∫
Ωµ

Sµ : δEµ dV (64)

The macroscopic deformed position of a material

point in ΩM around the point Xo must now be approx-

imated with a second-order approach using (3) as

4x ∼= F (Xo) · 4X +
1

2
G (Xo) : 4X �4X, (65)

and the approximated macroscopic deformation gradi-

ent is

F ∼= F (Xo) + G (Xo) · 4X. (66)

The macroscopic strain tensor in the ΩM domain for

infinitesimal deformation approach can be then approx-

imated as

E ∼=

(67)

or

E ∼= E (Xo) + EG (Xo,X) , (68)

where EG = 1
2

(
G · 4X + (G · 4X)T

)
.

Taking into account (63) and (68), the expression

given by (64) can be rewritten as

and because of the symmetry of S, it can be proved

that S : (∇a) = S : (∇a)T and S : (G.a) = S : (G.a)T ,
where a is a first order tensor. Then, (69) is finally

Following the same procedure used in Section 2.1.4 to

satisfy the Hill-Mandel principle, it is necessary to de-

fine the following tensors:

Ŝ ≡

VM

∫

S dV ≡

∫

the point Xo, and

Q̂ ≡

∫
ΩM

S �4X dV ≡

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Sµ � Xµ dV. (72)

where Q̂ is the homogenized second-order stress tensor

in the point Xo, which is a third-order tensor. Finally,

the RVE’s variational equilibrium equation is∫
Ωµ

Sµ : ∇sδw dV = 0, (73)

that must be satisfied for any kinematically admissible

w shown in Section 3.1.

3.4 Homogenized stress and second-order stress tensor

The microscopic stress tensor can be obtained as

Sµ = Cµ : E (Xo) + Cµ : E
G
µ (Xo,Xµ)

+ Cµ : E
w
µ (Xµ) , (74)

then, Ŝ at the macroscopic scale given by (71) is

12 F. Otero et al.

where

B̄ ≡

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Cµ � Xµ dV. (77)

The tensor B̄ can be considered a material property

which relates G with Ŝ, and generates a coupling ef-

fect. This constitutive tensor is analogous to the called

bending-extension coupling matrix used in plates or shells

theories [2].

Equation (76) shows that Ŝ in the point Xo depends

of the macroscopic E and G, of the microscopic w and

also, of the position Xµ of the RVE. Considering now

a particular case where the simple materials within the

RVE are symmetrically located respect to the coordi-

nate system’s origin, which has been placed on the RVE

geometric center (see Section 3.1). It can be proved that

taking this symmetric distribution of the simple mate-

rials the value obtains for B̄ is zero. Therefore, Ŝ for

this case can be rewritten as

Ŝ = C̄ : E (Xo) +
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Cµ : E
w
µ (Xµ) dV. (78)

Now, the term G and the position Xµ do not affect Ŝ,

and expression given by (78) is the same than the one

obtained for FOCH given by (32).

On the other hand, the homogenized second-order

stress tensor can be obtained using (72) and Sµ given

by (74) as

Q̂ =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Cµ � Xµ dV : E (Xo)

w
µ (Xµ) � Xµ dV, (80)

where

D̄ =
1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

(Cµ � Xµ) � Xµ dV. (81)

The tensor D̄ is also considered a material property,

which is obtained with the RVE model, as it is done

with tensors C̄ and B̄. Taking into account the sym-

metric materials distribution inside the RVE, the ex-

pression for Q̂ can be rewritten as

Q̂ = D̄
... G (Xo) +

1

Vµ

∫
Ωµ

Cµ : E
w
µ (Xµ) � Xµ dV. (82)

Equation (82) shows that Q̂ depends on the macro-

scopic G and on the microscopic w. But it also depends

on the position Xµ of the material point in the RVE. In

addition, the tensor D̄ does not vanish because of the

symmetric materials distribution.

3.5 Some remarks of the EFOCH

In the proposed EFOCH is lost the benefit shown by

the FOCH regarding the possibility of using a non-

dimensional RVE. Now, the microscopic strain (63) and

stress (74) tensor have an explicit dependence with the

position Xµ in the RVE. Besides, to satisfy (69), which

is obtained from the Hill-Mandel condition, it is nec-

essary to impose that Ωµ ≡ ΩM . Thus the RVE’s di-
mension used to characterize the microstructure should

be equal to the size of the finite volume around the

considered point Xo.

On the other hand, a detailed analysis of the EFOCH

formulation shows that the FOCH is contained in it.

Therefore, when the principle of separation of scales is

satisfied (l� lµ), the results given by the EFOCH will
be the same than the ones provided by the FOCH.

As will be shown in the next section, the EFOCH

conserves the classical first-order BVP in the structural

level. Therefore, the macroscopic second-order stress

tensor obtained from the RVE solution is not consid-

ered in the macroscopic problem. This restricts the use

of the EFOCH to analyses where the principle of separa-

tion of scales is satisfied or moderately satisfied. When

this principle is not verified, the homogenized tensor Q̂

should be considered in the macroscopic BVP as the

SOCH does [60, 62, 30].

However, from a microscopic point of view, the re-

sults of the EFOCH are better than the ones provided

with the FOCH. Although the macroscopic stress tensor

obtained for both theories is the same, the microscopic

displacement field, the strain and, the stress tensors are

not equal. The EFOCH obtains a better approximation

of the microscopic behavior. Therefore, in a non-linear

analysis, the initiation and the evolution of the non-

linear performance of the microstructure will be better

characterized.

4 Formulation and numerical implementation

In the following, the macroscopic and microscopic BVPs

are presented.



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 13

4.1 Macroscopic BVP

A macrostructural scale of domain Ω with a periodic

internal microstructure is considered. The kinematics

of the problem is related to a displacement field on the

macroscopic scale, which provides the displacement of

each material point in Ω. From a continuum mechanics

approach the macroscopic BVP is

∂Sij
∂Xj

+ fi = 0 in Ω,

ui = ūi in ∂Ωu,

SijNj = t̄i in ∂Ωt,

(83)

where Sij is the macroscopic stress tensor, and fi is

the internal body force associated to the mass force

of the material. The boundary of Ω (∂Ω) is defined

disjointedly by the surfaces ∂Ωu where the macroscopic

displacement is known ūi (Dirichlet’s condition) and

∂Ωt where the macroscopic surface load t̄i is known

(Neumann’s condition) with ∂Ωu∪∂Ωt = ∂Ω and ∂Ωu∩
∂Ωt = ∅. Finally, Nj are the components of an outward
vector normal to the surface ∂Ωt.

The resolution of the BVP given by (83) consists on

the determination of the macroscopic displacement field

corresponding to the solution u ∈ VΩ , where VΩ is the
set of continuous and sufficiently regular functions with

zero-value in ∂Ωu. The partial differential equation in

the macroscopic BVP presented above can be rewritten

in a weak form (or variational form) as∫
Ω

∂Sij
∂Xj

vi dV +

∫
Ω

fivi dV = 0 ∀ v ∈ VΩ , (84)

where vi are the called test functions. Equation (84)

can be rewritten, applying the divergence theorem, as∫

where ∇suµ is the symmetric gradient of the micro-
scopic displacement field in the RVE and VΩµ is the

set of continuous and sufficiently regular kinematically

admissible RVE displacement fields. Further, it is as-

sumed that in the microstructure the constitutive be-

havior is described by conventional internal dissipative

constitutive theories. Therefore, the microscopic stress

tensor is obtained by integrating the constitutive equa-

tions, knowing a set of internal variables α, for the given

strain tensor history. Then, it is

Sµ = Sµ(Eµ,α) = Sµ(∇suµ,α). (89)

With the above at hand, the resolution of the prob-

lem consists on the determination of uµ ∈ VΩµ of the
variational problem for a given macroscopic tensor F,

and its gradient G in EFOCH. Therefore, to complete

the microscopic BVP it is necessary to define the bound-

ary conditions used to obtain kinematically admissible

displacement fields from the solution of (87).

4.2.1 Consequence of the boundary conditions selected

The RVE has a finite dimension, which is opposed to the
theoretically infinite microstructure usually considered.

This creates the intrinsic problem of the non-physical

RVE edges. As a result, the election of the boundary

condition in the RVE problem is essential to character-

ize the real behavior of the microstructure.

It has been shown in Section 2.1.5 that the boundary

condition used in the RVE problem affects the macro-

scopic stress tensor obtained and therefore it also af-

fects the homogenized constitutive tensor. In example,

the expression (32) shows that using the Taylor model

condition the result provides an upper bound of the

estimated homogenized microscopic stiffness.

On the other hand, the Minimal constraint provides

a lower bound of the estimated effective microstructural

stiffness. This boundary condition imposes the macro-

scopic strain tensor on the RVE in the weakest sense.

It has been shown that the resulting boundary distri-

bution of the microscopic stress tensor in the RVE is

uniform and equal to the macroscopic stress tensor in

this boundary restriction [74, 17].



14 F. Otero et al.

The Linear boundary displacements condition is a

too restrictive constraint and it overestimates the ho-

mogenized microscopic stiffness [13]. A conventional BVP

with full Dirichlet’s condition is obtained for the RVE.

It is shown in literature that the Periodic boundary

fluctuations provide a better apparent stiffness estima-

tion for both periodic as well as random microstructures

[123, 109, 74, 53, 54, 78, 98]. This condition makes the

RVE self adjoint by point to point (pairs of points)

coupling of boundary displacements, thereby it natu-

rally incorporates the mechanical response of the sur-

rounding material. Moreover, an anti-periodic condition

of the boundary forces is automatically fulfilled in the

problem because the boundary points of the RVE are

considered as internal points of the structure.

Based on the different performances described, in

this work the Periodic boundary fluctuations condition

will be used in the computational implementation for

both approaches considered, FOCH and EFOCH.

tuations condition was obtained (see (21)). Using (9)

4.3 Numerical implementation

The numerical solution of the presented BVPs are ob-

tained through the FEM. To solve the macroscopic BVP

it will be necessary to know the stress tensor in the

macro domain. The multiscale computational homoge-

nization methods above described are used as constitu-

tive models of the heterogeneous material. Therefore,

the macroscopic F, for the FOCH, and its gradient G,

for the EFOCH, are used to solve the microscopic BVP.

Consequently, the homogenized stress tensor necessary

to solve the macroscopic BVP is obtained from the so-

lution of this microscopic problem.

The proposed EFOCH has been implemented in PLCd

[99, 93], a parallel FE code that works with 3D solid ge-

ometries. The PLCd program has already implemented

the FOCH described previously [95, 94]. The micro-

scopic displacement field obtained from the solution of

the microscopic BVP must satisfy the boundary condi-

tions defined previously, in Section 4.2.1. The restric-

tions of degrees of freedom on the RVE boundary do-

main is imposed by an elimination of redundant un-

knowns [35, 95]. Equations (90), (91) and (92) show the

redundant boundary unknowns. In these expressions it

is possible identify master unknowns (the unknowns

to solve) and slave unknowns [93]. In appendix A, the

master-slave kinematic relationships are presented for

the EFOCH.

4.4 Some important considerations

Based on the characteristics of the formulations devel-

oped, as well as on the implementation of these formu-

lations using the finite element method, in the following

are included some final remarks regarding the implica-

tions of using the FOCH or the EFOCH.

Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity that the

macroscopic FE mesh has a single integration point. In

this case, the macroscopic finite volume ΩM around the

considered point Xo in the formulation is related with

the FE domain as Ωe = ΩM , where Ωe is the FE do-

main. Taking into account the considerations made in

Section 3.5 it can be concluded that Ωe = Ωµ, which

means that for the integration point of the FE, the RVE

domain must be geometrically equal to the FE domain.

Consequently, in the EFOCH the RVE dimension is re-

lated with the discretization mesh used in the macro-

scopic BVP.

The macroscopic BVP presented in Section 4.1 does

not take into account the homogenized second-order

stress tensor Q̂ obtained in the enhanced-first-order ho-

mogenization. Besides, if the RVE materials are sym-

metrically distributed in it, the estimated homogenized



Computational Multiscale Homogenization 15

stress tensor obtained is the same for both homogeniza-

tion approaches. Therefore, the proposed EFOCH does

not improve the macroscopic results obtained from the

BVP. To improve these, a high-order FE or enhanced

FE mesh must be considered at the structural scale. To

account for the homogenized second-order stress ten-

sor Q̂ in the macroscopic scale a SOCH must be used

[60, 62, 30].

4.5 Linear FE in the macroscopic mesh

In linear finite element the interpolation functions are

first-order polynomials and consequently, the displace-

ment field in the domain of the FE is a first-order func-

tion. The strain tensor is obtained by differentiating

the displacement field, then the strain tensor in the FE

will be a constant function. Therefore, a fine FE mesh

on the macroscopic BVP should be used to obtain an

accurate approximation of the strains and stresses.

When linear finite elements and a FOCH are used to

solve the macroscopic problem, the RVE is just a rep-

resentative sub-domain of the periodic microstructure

that does not have any significance on real microscopic

dimension as has been shown in Section 2.1.5. The con-

stant value of the macroscopic gradient tensor F in the

integration point of the macroscopic FE is used to de-

fine the BVP in the RVE. From the solution of the

microscopic problem the macroscopic stress tensor is

obtained for the considered integration point.

In linear FE case, the solution of the microscopic

BVP with the EFOCH is an inefficient procedure be-

cause the value of G in the integration point of the

macroscopic linear element has partial or even zero in-

formation.

4.6 High-order FE in the macroscopic mesh

To improve the FEM approach high-order elements can

be used. Quadratic finite elements use second-order poly-

nomials as interpolation functions to approximate the

displacement field within the FE’s domain. The defor-

mation gradient tensor F of this element is a first-order

function, while gradient of the deformation gradient

tensor G, which is obtained deriving twice the displace-

ment, is a constant function on the FE domain.

The developed EFOCH needs at least quadratic el-

ements in the macroscopic mesh in order for the func-

tions F and G not to have zero value in the FE domain.

Quadratic elements need more than one Gauss point

to obtain the best integration approximation. As men-

tioned before, in the proposed homogenization method

the RVE dimension must be related with the FE dimen-

sion. Therefore, for quadratic elements the RVE must

represent the sub-domain within the FE associated to

the Gauss point. If not, the analysis will have an asso-

ciated error due to the size mismatch.

For this case, the best approximation of the strain

and stress fields at the micro-scale is obtained through

an EFOCH together with a RVE which represents the

real volume of the surrounding domain in the Gauss

point. The numerical examples described in Section 5

show that the EFOCH produces more realistic stress

fields at the micro-scale which will lead to a better ma-

terial characterization, specially if non-linear effects are

taken into account.

5 Numerical example

The objective is this section to show the advantages and

drawbacks of the EFOCH with respect to the FOCH

through numerical examples.

Two numerical examples have been analyzed with

the same macroscopic geometry, the first one uses a ho-

mogeneous material. In this case, the numerical results

can be compared with the existing analytical solution.

The second numerical simulation uses a matrix with a

long fiber reinforcement.

5.1 Geometry, boundary conditions and mesh

information

5.1.1 Macroscopic Beam model

The macroscopic structure chosen is a three-dimensional

fixed support beam that is subjected to a fixed displace-

ment (dZ) at the free end. Figure 6 shows the dimen-

sions and the support scheme on the geometry of the

beam.

To study the numerical stability and convergence of

the problem four mesh sizes are simulated. Linear ele-

ments and quadratic elements are used in the different

meshes of the numerical model for the FOCH case while

only quadratic FEs are used for the EFOCH. The lin-

ear FE is an hexahedron of 8 nodes and 8 Gauss points,

and the quadratic FE is an hexahedron with 20 nodes

and 27 Gauss points.

Table 1 shows the more relevant information about

the macroscopic meshes used. These meshes are also

shown in Fig. 7.

5.1.2 Microscopic RVE model

The geometry of the RVE depends of the numerical sim-

ulation case. For the case of a homogeneous material,

the RVE is a simple cube with length L, this is shown

in Fig. 8a. In the second simulation case, the material

defined is a composite with a 40% of cylindrical long

fiber volume. The geometry of the RVE that represents

this periodical microstructure is shown in the Fig. 8b.

It has been shown in previous section that the di-

mension of the RVE is an important parameter for the

EFOCH. Moreover, this dimension L is directly related

with the volume around the Gauss point of the FE

in the macroscopic mesh. Therefore, the value of the

length L depends of the dimension of the macroscopic

FE used and of the number of Gauss points of the

FE. In Table 2 the number of elements in the beam

height, Z direction, and the value that takes the length

L in the RVE for the different macroscopic meshes used

are shown. The value of the length L has been cal-

culated considering quadratic elements on the macro-

scopic mesh.

The RVE has been analyzed with just one FE model.

mogeneous material case, which has 1000 FE. Figure 9b

5.2 Results and analysis

5.2.1 Checkpoints and variables compared in the

simulation

The reaction force in Z direction on the fixed support

is a variable used for the comparison. To compare not

only this macroscopic variable another checkpoint has

been designed. The macroscopic stress value is com-

pared in the macroscopic Gauss point closest to point

A (see Fig. 6) and the microscopic stress obtained in

the RVE is also compared for this same Gauss point.

The microscopic stress value used for the comparison is

the one obtained in the Gauss point closest to point A

within the RVE. The geometric point A is shown in Fig.

6. The longitudinal stress values (SXX) and the shear

stress values (SXZ) will be compared on this point.

5.2.2 Homogeneous material simulation

When the material used in the beam is a homogeneous

material it is possible to obtain the analytical solution

for the support scheme shown in the Fig. 6. The reac-

tion force in Z direction is given by

RZ =

where E and G is the Young’s modulus and shear mod-

ulus of the material, respectively, while Iyy, A and l

are the second moment of area, the cross section area

and the longitudinal length of the beam, respectively.

Therefore, considering an isotropic material with null

Poisson’s ratio, E = 26560 [MPa], G = 13280 [MPa]

and taking a fixed displacement of dZ = 1 [mm], it is

possible to address the values shown in Table 3 from the

analytical solution. The SXX and SXZ values shown in

table correspond to the analytical values obtained in

point A.

The numerical results obtained for the different ap-

proaches and meshes are presented in a simplified form

using tables and graphs. On the tables, the relative er-

ror or absolute error obtained when comparing the re-

sult with the analytical solution is also shown.

Table 4 shows the reaction force in Z direction ob-

tained with the numerical simulations. In this table,

the results obtained with Linear Elements (LE) in the

macro-model and the First-Order (FO) computational

homogenization are shown in the first two rows. The fol-

lowing two rows show the results obtained with Quadratic

Elements (QE) and the FOCH. And, in the last two

rows, are included the results obtained with QE for

the macro model, and the Enhanced-First-Order (EFO)

computational homogenization.

It is possible to observe that the results do not

change when a EFOCH is used, if they are compared

with the QE&FO results. This is because the EFOCH

formulation does not improve the macroscopic solution.

The macroscopic stress field obtained is the same than

the one obtained with a FOCH approach, and therefore

the reaction forces are also the same (see Table 5). An-

other interesting conclusion obtained from the results is

that an increase in the order of the macro FE represents

a meaningful improvement. The mesh Macro1 with QE

obtains best results than the mesh Macro4 with LE,

which is surprising because Macro4 has 16 FE in the

beam height. Figure 10 shows the curves of reaction

force vs number of FEs in the beam height. This curve

shows clearly the result previously addressed.

Table 5 shows the macroscopic longitudinal stress

obtained from the numerical simulations and the rela-

tive error of these numerical results using the analytical

result SXX = 100 [MPa] as reference. The stress values

shown in the table correspond to the ones obtained for

the Gauss point closest to point A on the beam meshes.

It has to be noted that for large meshes, the error is also

increased because the position of the Gauss point, from

which the numerical result is obtained, differs slightly

from the position of point A.

The improvements of the EFOCH can be seen when

comparing the microscopic results provided by the RVEs

used in the macroscopic Gauss point closest to point A.

The longitudinal stress and shear stress present in the

following tables and figures are the microscopic stress

values of the Gauss point in the RVE closest to point

A. Table 6 shows the value of the longitudinal stress

obtained within the RVE for the Gauss point closest to

point A. This table shows that the results provided by

the EFOCH are always closer to the analytical ones, as

the model is capable of capturing the bending effects in

the material.

Figure 11 shows the stress obtained as a function of

the number of elements in the beam height. The general

behavior of the stress when the number of elements in-

crease is similar. When a EFOCH is used the estimation

Fig. 11 SXX obtained close to point A for the different
meshes and approaches used

of the stress is good even for large elements. Moreover,

the benefit of change the approach is more significant

for meshes with low number of elements. The relative

error for 2 elements case is around 1% which represents

a very good estimation.

As an example of the macroscopic and microscopic

longitudinal stress field obtained for the different ap-

proaches Fig. 12 shows SXX for the mesh case Macro3.

For the FOCH the figure shows an uniform stress dis-

tribution in the RVE, this is because the formulation

only uses the macroscopic deformation gradient to solve

the RVE. This occurs independently of the macro ele-

ments uses, LE or QE. The macroscopic improvement

observed in the QE model is because the solution of

the macroscopic problem is better when this kind of

element is used. For the same macroscopic solution, if

an EFOCH is used, the approximation of the micro-

scopic stress field improves. The RVE stress field shows

a not uniform distribution (see QE&EFO case) because

the EFOCH can considered second-order effects in the

microstructure.

The results obtained for the shear stress in the RVE

for the Gauss point closest to point A are shown in Ta-

ble 7. This table does not show the relative error be-

cause for this variable the analytical value obtained in

the geometric point A is SXZ = 0 [MPa]. Figure 13

shows the shear stress obtained for the different ap-

proaches as a function of the number of elements in

the height of the beam. From the table and the fig-

ure it is possible to observe that the main improvement

in the shear stress results it is presented when the FE

is changed. However, the use of the EFOCH improves

the shear stress obtained for all meshes considered. The

reason for this improvements is, as has been pointed

out with the SXX value, the capacity that the EFOCH

gives to the RVE model to account for the second-order

effects existing in the macro model.

5.2.3 Composite material

In the following numerical simulations, the material

used is a composite with long fibers. The RVE used

to simulate the internal structure of this composite is

shown in Fig. 8b, while the FE mesh used is shown in

Fig. 9b. The material used for the matrix is an elastic

isotropic material (resin epoxy HSC Epikote 4652) with

a Young’s modulus of Em = 4.52 [GPa] and a Poisson’s

ratio of vm = 0.36. The long fiber material considered

is a carbon fiber (Grafil TR30S 3K carbon fiber) with

a Ef = 235 [GPa] and vf = 0.21. The materials prop-

erties have been taken from the work of Perez et al.

[97].

Table 8 shows the Z direction reaction force ob-

tained for the different approaches and meshes used in

the numerical simulation. Figure 14 shows these same

reaction forces plotted against the number of elements

on the beam height. This figure shows that the global

performance provided in the different models for the ho-

mogeneous material is also provided for the composite

material. This is: changing the computational homog-

enization does not change the reaction force obtained

and the use of QE represents a meaningful improvement

of the results obtained.

The improvements on the microscopic results when

an EFOCH is used can be seen in Fig. 15. The mi-

croscopic stress fields shown in the figures correspond

to the RVE of the macroscopic Gauss point closest to

point A for the beam mesh Macro3. Figures on the

for the FOCH is almost uniform for both types of FE

considered. While in the case of EFOCH the fiber stress

distribution in the RVE is more realistic considering the

bending macroscopic state. The classical linear distri-

bution in the longitudinal stress expected for a bending

load is achieved around the average value obtained for

the FOCH approach. The stress distribution for the ma-

trix present a similar behavior to the fiber component.

It can be observed that the maximum stress for the

fiber and matrix within the RVE are obtained in the

Gauss points closest to point A, which is an expected

result.

To quantify the improvement on the microscopic so-

lution due to the EFOCH, Table 9 shows the maximum

values of the longitudinal stress for the fiber and ma-

trix components within the RVE. These stress values

are graphically represented in Fig. 16 for both compo-

nents. From the figures is clearly seen that the response

of components change when the approach is changed.

6 Conclusions

This work presents an extension of the classical First-

Order Computational Homogenization (FOCH), which

has been called Enhanced-First-Order Computational

Homogenization (EFOCH). The proposed EFOCH con-

siders the macroscopic second-order term (G) in the mi-

croscopic displacement as the Second-Order Computa-

tional Homogenization (SOCH) does. However, the pre-

sented EFOCH conserves a first-order Boundary Value

Problem (BVP) at the macroscopic scale.

As in the case of SOCH, the EFOCH obtains the

same microscopic variational equilibrium equation than

the FOCH (see (73)). However, the solution of the mi-

croscopic BVP must satisfy extra boundary conditions,

related to the term G. In the numerical implemen-

tation, Periodic boundary fluctuations condition have

been imposed through the elimination of redundant un-

knowns method [95].

In the macroscopic BVP, the EFOCH does not take

intro account the second-order stress tensor (Q̂) associ-

ated to G because the classical first-order formulations

is preserved. Besides, the homogenized stress tensor ob-

tained is the same than the one obtained with a FOCH

due to the assumption of the symmetric materials dis-

tribution in the RVE. Because of the above, the macro-

scopic solution is not improved when the EFOCH is

used.

However, the EFOCH is better than the FOCH from

a microscopic point of view. The microscopic displace-

ment field, the strain and the stress tensors are en-

hanced. The EFOCH gets a better approximation of

the microscopic behavior because it takes into account

the extra information provided by G. Therefore, phe-

nomena such as macroscopic bending or localization ef-

fect can be observed in the solution of the microscopic

problem. With the proposed EFOCH, the initiation and

the evolution of the non-linear performance of the mi-

crostructure will be better characterized.

Finally, it is possible to show that the FOCH is

a particular case of the EFOCH. Therefore, when the

principle of separation of scales is strictly verified, the

results obtained using the EFOCH are the same than

the ones obtained using the FOCH. In other words, if

the periodic microstructural length lµ is much smaller

than the structure characteristic length l, the contribu-

tion of G in the microscopic solution is negligible.

A Microscopic Kinematic relationships for the

EFOCH

In the following are described the kinematic relationships de-
fined between master and slaves nodes of the RVE, required
for the implementation of the EFOCH in a FEM software.

In the Fig. 17, it is possible identify easily master nodes
(named with a letter) and slave nodes (named with a letter
and number). This is when a structured FE mesh on the
boundary of the RVE is used. In the vertices nodes, also it
is possible to identify a master node (“1”) and seven slave
nodes (“2” ,“3” , ... and “8”).

Using (91) is possible to write the displacement of the
slave node “a1” as a function of the displacement of the mas-
ter node “a” for EFOCH as

ūa1 = ūa +D2 (F− I) ·N
+

+

To simplify the final expressions is defined

The extra boundary restrictions must be also satisfied.

Here, Nyz, Nxz and Nxy are the shape functions on the neg-
ative face Y Z, XZ and XY of the RVE, respectively. And,
from Fig. 18 it is possible to write the displacement vectors
of the nodes on the different negative faces as

ūyz = {ū1|ū4|ū5|ū8|ūb|ūb3 |ūc|ūc3 |ūe},
ūxz = {ū1|ū2|ū5|ū6|ūa|ūa3 |ūc|ūc1 |ūf},
ūxy = {ū1|ū2|ū3|ū4|ūa|ūa1 |ūb|ūb1 |ūd}.

In the previous displacement vectors of the nodes on the neg-
ative faces of the RVE it is possible identify masters and
slaves nodes. Therefore, the boundary constraints (95) ob-
tained above can be written in terms of master nodes as

Amyz · ūmyz = Hmyz , in ∂Ωh
µ|N−

X

,

Amxz · ūmxz = Hmxz , in ∂Ωh
µ|N−

Y

,

Amxy · ūmxy = Hmyz , in ∂Ωh
µ|N−

Z

.

(96)

where,

ūmyz = {ū1|ūb|ūc|ūe}, ū
m
xz = {ū1|ūa|ūc|ūf},

ūmxy = {ū1|ūa|ūb|ūd}.

and, as an example, the term of the matrix Amyz for the ūb of
the master nodes on the negative face Y Z is

Amyz|b = Ayz|b + A
m
yz|b3 ,

and the contribution to Hmyz for the ūb3 of the slave nodes on
the negative face Y Z is

Hmyz|b = A
m
yz|b3 · (sm3 + sm

The master nodes on the different negative faces of the
RVE must verify (96). Therefore, with the aim to find redun-
dant unknowns, it is possible to identify another slave extra
node by each negative face which can be obtained as a func-
tion of the other master nodes. Then,
