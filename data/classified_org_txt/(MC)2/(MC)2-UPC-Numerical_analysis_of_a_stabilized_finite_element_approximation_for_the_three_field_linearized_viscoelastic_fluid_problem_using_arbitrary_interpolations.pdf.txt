NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF A STABILIZED FINITE ELEMENT

APPROXIMATION FOR THE THREE-FIELD LINEARIZED VISCOELASTIC

FLUID PROBLEM USING ARBITRARY INTERPOLATIONS

E. Castillo1 and R. Codina2

Abstract. In this paper we present the numerical analysis of a three-field stabilized finite element
formulation recently proposed to approximate viscoelastic flows. The three-field viscoelastic fluid
flow problem may suffer from two types of numerical instabilities: on the one hand we have the
two inf-sup conditions related to the mixed nature problem and, on the other, the convective na-
ture of the momentum and constitutive equations may produce global and local oscillations in the
numerical approximation. Both can be overcome by resorting from the standard Galerkin method
to a stabilized formulation. The one presented here is based on the subgrid scale concept, in which
unresolvable scales of the continuous solution are approximately accounted for. In particular, the
approach developed herein is based on the decomposition into their finite element component and a
subscale, which is approximated properly to yield a stable formulation. The analyzed problem cor-
responds to a linearized version of the Navier-Stokes/Oldroyd-B case where the advection velocity
of the momentum equation and the non-linear terms in the constitutive equation are treated using
a fixed point strategy for the velocity and the velocity gradient. The proposed method permits the
resolution of the problem using arbitrary interpolations for all the unknowns. We describe some im-
portant ingredients related to the design of the formulation and present the results of its numerical
analysis. It is shown that the formulation is stable and optimally convergent for small Weissenberg
numbers, independently of the interpolation used.

that define the problem presents different types of numerical instabilities and difficulties in which intensive
research has been done in recent years (see for example [1, 25,37] for a review about this topic).

When using finite elements, the numerical approximation of the flow of viscoelastic fluids presents basically
two types of instabilities. The first is associated with the two compatibility or inf-sup conditions that restrict
the possible choices of interpolation spaces. The second is related to the convective terms in both the
momentum and the hyperbolic constitutive equation, in both cases nonlinear.

Referring to the compatibility conditions, many authors have studied the problem, considering first sim-
plified model problems such as the three-field Stokes problem [9, 18, 35] or the three-field Navier-Stokes
problem [3,12], which have the same interpolation requirements as the viscoelastic case. For these simplified
problems the classical compatibility condition between velocity and pressure [10] is not sufficient, and an ad-
ditional condition that relates the interpolation of the velocity with that of the elastic stress must be added.
The convective terms have been treated using the extension of classical methods used for the Navier-Stokes
problem, such as the SUPG method [34], the Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) method [23] or approaches based
on the Variational Multiscale (VMS) concept (see [13,31], among others).

Concerning the mathematical analysis, the existence of a slow steady viscoelastic flow solution has been
proved by Renardy in [36]. For the time-dependent case, existence of solutions locally in time, and for small
data globally in time, have been proved by Guillopé and Saut [26]. These analysis have been performed
in Hilbert spaces. The extension to Banach spaces and a complete review of uniqueness, regularity, well-
posedness and stability results can be found in the work of Fernández-Cara et al. [25]. The existence of global
weak solutions for general initial conditions using a co-rotational Oldroyd model has been proved by Lions
and Masmoudi in [33].

In the context of the finite element approximation, for the steady state case one of the first works where
the existence of approximate solutions and error analysis were presented is that of Baranger and Sandri in [2].
The authors used a discontinuous interpolation (Lesaint-Raviart method) to treat the viscoelastic stresses.
Later, Sandri in [40] showed by using a fixed point method that the discrete approximate problem using a
P1(continuous)-P2(continuous)-P1(continuous) interpolation for stress, velocity and pressure, respectively,
and the SUPG method to treat the convective term in the constitutive equation, has an unique solution
for which error bounds were given, supposing that the continuous problem admits sufficiently smooth and
small solutions. Picasso and Rappaz [35] analyzed a stationary non-linear Stokes problem (Stokes/Oldroyd-
B model without convective term), and they proved a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the finite
element approximation for small Weissenberg numbers using a GLS method and an Elastic Viscous Split
Stress (EVSS) scheme. The extension to the time-dependent case was treated in [8] for the same non-linear
Stokes problem, proving global existence in time in Banach spaces provided the data are small enough. For
a Stokes/Oldroyd-B linearized problem, Bonito and Burman presented in [7] optimal a priori error estimates
using the Interior-Penalty method. In this work the authors showed that adding some type of artificial
viscosity in the constitutive equation, the problem can be solved for a large range of Weissenberg numbers. A
similar problem was studied by Ervin et al. in [21] for the steady state case, but using the Johnson-Segalman
linearized constitutive model, proving existence and uniqueness of the continuous problem and of a finite
element approximation under small data assumption. Ervin and Miles in [22] analyzed the Oldroyd-B time-
dependent case both in the semi-discrete and in the fully discrete cases using the SUPG method, proving

existence and deriving a priori error estimates for the numerical approximation, assuming a Taylor-Hood pair
approximation for the velocity and pressure and a continuous approximation for the viscoelastic stresses.

The stabilized finite element formulation analyzed in this work has its roots in the VMS framework
introduced by Hughes et al. [28] for the scalar convection-diffusion-reaction problem, and extended later to
the vectorial Stokes problem in [16], where the space of the sub-grid scales is taken orthogonal to the finite
element space. As we shall see, this is an important ingredient in the design of the formulation analyzed
herein. The starting point of a VMS approach is to split the unknowns of the problem in two scales, the
finite element one and the unresolvable one, called sub-grid scale or simply subscale in what follows. The
latter needs to be approximated in a simple manner in terms of the former, so as to capture its main effect
and yield a stable formulation for the finite element unknown, keeping therefore the number of degrees of
freedom of the Galerkin method.

One of the most common viscoelastic constitutive models used in the rheological community is the Oldroyd-
B model. When this model is approximated numerically, the most challenging problem associated to it is
the High Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP), a phenomenon related to the inability of the numerical
algorithms to converge to a solution when the Weissenberg (or Deborah) number is high (see for example
[29, 38] and the references therein). Some numerical tools have been proved to increase the limits of the
numerical formulations to solve more elastic fluids. The log-conformation formulation presented by Fattal and
Kupferman [24] is a common possibility to deal with the exponential growth of stresses when the Weissenberg
number is increased. Continuation methods are another numerical tool used to increase the Weissenberg
number limits that can be reached by a standard formulation, as one can see in the work of Howell [27]. For
the treatment of local oscillations, discontinuity-capturing techniques have proved to produce good results
in [7, 13].

The objective of this paper is to analyze numerically a stabilized finite element formulation presented in
previous works and tested numerically with very good accuracy and robustness properties, both in stationary
[13] and time dependent cases [11, 14]. The analysis is standard and follows a classical approach to prove
stability and convergence, first using a mesh-dependent or working norm, and then extending the results to
natural norms, that is to say, to the norms of the spaces where the continuous problem is posed. As it is
common to other analyses, the Weissenberg number needs to be small enough.

The paper is organized as follows. In the following section we present the problem to be solved and its
Galerkin finite element approximation, explaining the sources of numerical instability. Then, in Section 3 we
present our stabilized finite element formulation. In Section 4, we present the numerical analysis performed,
and finally, conclusions and remarks are given in Section 5.

2. Problem statement and Galerkin finite element discretization

2.1. Boundary value problem

The stationary linearized viscoelastic fluid flow problem is defined by the following equations. First we
have the conservation equations for momentum and mass

ρa · ∇u−∇ · T +∇p = f in Ω (1)

∇ · u = 0 in Ω (2)



4 TITLE WILL BE SET BY THE PUBLISHER

where a is the advection velocity vector, Ω represents the computational domain of Rd occupied by the
fluid, d = 2 or 3 being the space dimensions, ρ denotes the density of the fluid, p : Ω −→ R the pressure,
u : Ω −→ Rd the velocity field, f : Ω → Rd the force vector and T : Ω −→ Rd ⊗ Rd the deviatoric extra
stress tensor, which can be defined in terms of a viscous and a viscoelastic or elastic contribution as

T = 2βµ∇su+ σ (3)

where, µ represents the total viscosity, β ∈ (0, 1) is a real parameter to define the amount of viscous or solvent
viscosity µs = βµ and elastic or polymeric viscosity µp = (1− β)µ in the fluid, and ∇su is the symmetrical
part of the gradient of u, given by

∇su :=
1

2
[∇u+ (∇u)T ]

In (1)-(2) and in what follows we use classical tensor notation; in particular, the dot stands for the contraction
of the nearest indexes of the tensors being multiplied.

We will consider that both the density ρ and the total viscosity µ are constants. For viscoelastic fluids,
the problem is incomplete without the definition of a constitutive equation for the elastic part of the extra
stress tensor (σ). A large variety of approaches exist to define it (see [4, 5] for a description). In this work,
we use the classical Oldroyd-B constitutive model to describe the fluid, which is defined as

2µ
σ − (1− β)∇su+

λ

2µ

(
a · ∇σ − σ · ∇a− (∇a)T · σ

)
= 0 in Ω (4)

where λ is the relaxation time. This equation can be viewed as a convection-reaction equation.
Equations (1)-(4) are a mixed elliptic-hyperbolic system which additionally needs boundary conditions

both in the velocity and in the stress fields to close the problem. In principle the elastic stresses can be fixed
only on the inflow part of the boundary Γin = {x ∈ ∂Ω | (u · n) (x) < 0}, where n is the outward unit normal
vector to ∂Ω. For simplicity in the exposition, we shall consider the simplest boundary condition u = 0 on
∂Ω for the velocity.

Calling U = [u, p,σ], F = [f , 0,0] and defining

L (U) :=



a · ∇σ − σ · ∇a− (∇a)T · σ



we may write (1), (2) and (4) as L (U) = F .
This linearized problem can be viewed as a viscoelastic Oseen problem that represents a linearization of the

stationary Navier-Stokes/Oldroyd-B problem, case in which a can be considered the velocity field evaluated
in a previous iteration. It also appears as one of the steps of some multilevel or multi-grid methods (see for
example [32] in the context of viscoelastic flows). This is why it is often used as a first step towards the
analysis of the full nonlinear problem, both to obtain a priori and posteriori error estimates. With respect
to the advection velocity, we will take it in C0

Ω
)
, weakly divergence free and with bounded derivatives (see

assumption H1 in the following section).

2.2. Variational form of the problem

Let us introduce some notation in order to write the weak form of the problem. The space of square
integrable functions in a domain ω is denoted by L2 (ω), and the space of functions whose distributional
derivatives of order up to m ≥ 0 (integer) belong to L2 (ω) by Hm (ω). The space H10 (ω) consists of
functions in H1 (ω) vanishing on ∂ω. The topological dual of H10 (Ω) is denoted by H

−1 (Ω), the duality
pairing by 〈·, ·〉, and the L2 inner product in Ω (for scalars, vectors and tensors) is denoted by (·, ·). The
integral of the product of two functions in a domain ω is denoted as 〈·, ·〉ω. The subscript ω is omitted when
ω = Ω. The norm in a space X is written as ‖·‖X , with the subscript omitted when X = L

2 (Ω). When
X = L2 (ω) we denote the norm by ‖·‖ω.

Let Υ :=
{
τ | τ ∈

)d×d
, τij = τji, a · ∇τ ∈

(
L2 (Ω)

)d×d}
, V := (H10 (Ω))d and Q := L2 (Ω) /R,

which are the spaces where we may seek the elastic stress, the velocity and the pressure, respectively. The
weak form of the problem is obtained by testing (5) against an arbitrary test function V = [v, q, τ ] with
appropriate regularity. It can be written as: find U = [u, p,σ] ∈ X := V ×Q×Υ such that

2βµ (∇su,∇sv) + 〈ρa · ∇u,v〉+ (σ,∇sv)− (p,∇ · v) = 〈f ,v〉 (6)

for all V = [v, q, τ ] ∈ X , where it is assumed that f is such that 〈f ,v〉 is well defined.
In a compact form, problem (6)-(8) can be written as

B (U ,V ) = 〈f ,v〉 (9)

for all V ∈ X , where

B (U ,V ) = 2βµ (∇su,∇sv) + 〈ρa · ∇u,v〉+ (σ,∇sv)− (p,∇ · v) + (q,∇ · u) +

(10)

To guarantee the well-posedness of problem (9), λ must be small enough and the advection velocity must
satisfy H1 below. Note that this assumption is consistent with those used in previous works [21,25,39], and
it is obviously inherited by the discrete problem:

H1 a ∈ V , ∇ · a = 0, ‖a‖L∞(Ω) ≤Ma <∞, ‖∇a‖L∞(Ω) ≤Mg <∞.

2.3. Stability of the Galerkin finite element discretization

Let us consider a finite element partition Ph = {K} of the domain Ω of diameter h. For simplicity, we
will consider quasi-uniform refinements, and thus all the element diameters can be bounded above and below
by constants multiplying h. Under the above considerations, we can construct conforming finite elements
spaces, Vh ⊂ V , Qh ⊂ Q and Υh ⊂ Υ in the usual manner. In practice, the zero mean for the pressure space
can be replaced by prescribing the pressure at an arbitrary point, and the symmetry of the stress tensor



6 TITLE WILL BE SET BY THE PUBLISHER

can be forced by choosing the degrees of freedom corresponding to the upper diagonal of this tensor. The
condition that the convective derivative of the stress be square integrable will follow from H1 and choosing
the stresses continuous, for example. The advection velocity a will be approximated by ah ∈ Vh; to simplify
the exposition, we will consider that this approximation also satisfies H1 (the zero divergence condition could
be avoided by the usual modification of the convective term in its skew-symmetric form).

If X h = Vh × Qh × Υh, and Uh = [uh, ph,σh], the Galerkin finite element approximation consists in
finding Uh ∈ X h such that

B (Uh,V h) = 〈f ,vh〉 (11)

for all V h = [vh, qh, τh] ∈ X h.
At the moment, we have posed no restrictions on the choice of the finite element spaces. However, there

are restriction that must be satisfied. For example, using the fact that ah is divergence free, it is readily
checked that

B (Uh, [(1− β)uh, (1− β) ph,σh]) = 2βµ (1− β) ‖∇suh‖

Assuming λ∇ah to be small enough, this expression provides only control on ‖σh‖
2 for all β ∈ (0, 1). To

control the other two fields one has then to make use of the two inf-sup conditions that restrict the possible
interpolations:

inf
qh∈Qh

sup
vh∈Vh

(qh,∇ · vh)
‖vh‖Vh ‖qh‖Qh

to control ph, and

inf
vh∈Vh

sup
τh∈Υh

(τh,∇svh)
‖τh‖Υh ‖vh‖Vh

≥ C2 (13)

to control ∇suh, where C1 and C2 are positive constants. It is therefore required that the finite element
spaces satisfy (12)-(13). These two conditions pose stringent requirements on the choice of the finite element
spaces (see for example [34] for the 2D case and [6] for the 3D case). Our intention in this paper is to analyze
a stabilized finite element formulation that avoids the need for such conditions and, in particular, allows one
to use equal interpolation for all the unknowns, including the possibility to use discontinuous interpolations.

Let us introduce some notation. Summation over all the elements of Ph will be indicated as
∑
K . The

collection of all edges (faces, for d = 3) will be denoted by Eh = {E} and, as for the elements, summation
over all these edges will be indicated as

∑
E . Suppose now that elements K1 and K2 share an edge E, and

let n1 and n2 be the normals to E exterior to K1 and K2, respectively. For a scalar function g, possibly
discontinuous across E, we define its jump as [[ ng ]]E := n1g|∂K1∩E + n2g|∂K2∩E , and for a vector or tensor
v, [[ n · v ]]E := n1 · v|∂K1∩E + n2 · v|∂K2∩E . When E ⊂ ∂Ω and n is the external normal, these definitions
reduce to [[ ng ]]E := ng|E and [[ n · v ]]E := n ·v|E . Generic positive constants will be denoted by C, possibly
with subscripts and with different values in different appearances. The symbol . will be used for ≤ up to
constants.

3. Stabilized finite element method

In this section we summarize the stabilized formulation analyzed. This formulation was proposed in [13]
and tested numerically in [11,13,14], but the numerical analysis was not performed yet. As a novelty of this



TITLE WILL BE SET BY THE PUBLISHER 7

work, we will introduce an additional stabilizing term for the subscales on the element boundaries that the
original work does not include, which allows us to consider discontinuous pressure and stress interpolations.

The method consist in replacing (11) by the following problem: find Uh ∈ X h such that

Bstab (Uh,V h) = B (Uh,V h) +B
∗ (Uh,V h) = 〈f ,vh〉 (14)

for all V h ∈ X h, where B∗ represent the stabilizing part of the model, defined as

B∗ (Uh,V h) = S
⊥

⊥
2 (Uh,V h) + S

⊥

where the three additional terms that define B∗ (Uh,V h) are associated to the stabilization terms of each
equation and are defined as

In (15)-(17), P⊥u represents the projection L
2-orthogonal to the velocity space without boundary condi-

tions, P⊥p the projection L
2-orthogonal to the pressure space and P⊥σ the projection L

2-orthogonal to the
stress space. For example P⊥u = I − Pu, where Pu is the L2 projection onto the velocity finite element
space without boundary conditions. We will also need to use the L2-projection onto the velocity space with
boundary conditions, Vh, that we will denote by Pu,0. The last term in S⊥1 is an approximation to the
subscales on the element boundaries and allows us to consider discontinuous interpolations for the pressure

and the stress. The design of the stabilization terms without the boundary term was presented in [13] for
the stationary three-field viscoelastic case. For the design of the boundary term we refer to [18], where a
three-field Stokes problem was analyzed in detail. The extension to the Oldroyd-B viscoelastic case is trivial.

The stabilization parameters αi, i = u or i = p or i = σ, are computed within each element K as

A possible justification for these parameters is the Fourier analysis presented in [18] for the three-field
Stokes problem or in [17] for the transient Navier-Stokes problem. The constants ci, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, are
algorithmic parameters. As a reference, the values used in the numerical experiments in [11,13,14] for linear
elements were c1 = 4.0 or 12.0 , c2 = 2.0, c3 = 4.0 and c4 = c5 = 0.25 or 1.0. For higher order elements
these values should be modified in terms of the interpolation order used (more details can be found in the
numerical references where the method was tested).

The boundary stabilization parameter in S⊥1 can be defined as α[u] =
δ0h
2µ

, as in [18, 20], where δ0 is an
algorithmic parameter that can be taken as δ0 = 0.1.

The method presented is a mix of an orthogonal term-by-term formulation for the momentum and con-
tinuity equations and a residual-based formulation for the constitutive equation. The term-by-term part
is not just a simplification of a standard residual based one. For smooth solutions, both have an optimal
convergence rate in h. However, in problems where the solution has strong gradients, we have found the
term-by-term formulation more robust than the residual-based one, which can be explained using numerical
analysis as we will show below. The method we analyze permits a term-by-term control of the orthogonal
projections of the pressure gradient, the convective term of the momentum equation and the divergence of
the elastic stress which is not possible using the residual-based formulation.

4. Numerical Analysis

The numerical analysis performed in this section follows a more or less standard approach. First we prove
stability in the form of inf-sup condition in a mesh dependent norm that depends on the stabilized formulation
used. Next we prove convergence in the same norm. Stability and convergence in natural norms, that is
to say, the norms where the continuous problem is posed, are then proved. Finally, we obtain an L2-error
estimate for the velocity using a duality argument.

4.1. Preliminaries

As it has been mentioned in Section 3, we will consider for the sake of conciseness quasi-uniform finite
element partitions. Therefore, we assume that there is a constant cinv, independent of the mesh size h (the
maximum of all the element diameters), such that

‖∇vh‖K ≤ cinvh
−1 ‖vh‖K



TITLE WILL BE SET BY THE PUBLISHER 9

for all finite element functions vh defined onK ∈ Ph, which can be either scalars, vectors or tensors. Similarly,
the trace inequality

‖v‖2∂K ≤ ctr
(
h−1 ‖v‖2K + h ‖∇v‖

K

)
is assumed to hold for functions v ∈ H1 (K), K ∈ Ph. The last term can be dropped if v is a polynomial
on the element domain K. Thus, if ϕh is a piecewise discontinuous polynomial and ψh a continuous one, it
follows that

Let Wh be a finite element space of degree kv. For any function v ∈ Hk

ε0 (v) = hε1 (v).
We will need a condition on the interpolating spaces that holds in the case of equal order interpolations

(see [19]), and that can be written as follows:
H2 Given ah,vh ∈ Vh, qh ∈ Qh, τh ∈ Υh and zh := ρah · ∇vh +∇qh −∇ · τh, there holds

‖zh‖ ≤ cm

‖Pu,0 (zh)‖+

∥∥P⊥u (zh)∥∥) , (22)
for a constant cm > 0.

According to this condition, the component of Pu (zh) that corresponds to the boundary of Ω can be
bounded in terms of the right-hand-side of Eq. (22). To prove this, one can use the macro-element technique
employed in [19].

although later on we will transform our results to natural norms under the assumption of small elasticity and
large viscosity. Note that the term multiplied by αp is unnecessary, since it is already contained in the first
right hand side term. However, we will keep it to see the effect of the subscale associated to the pressure.
It can also be helpful for some non-conforming elements (not considered in this work) for which the discrete
Korn inequality does not hold (see e.g. [30]).

If β is very small (or β = 0) the control on velocity gradient can be obtained from the term multiplied by
ασ. However, to simplify a little the analysis we will consider β > 0, and the stability provided by the first
term relevant enough.

Note that the stabilization term S⊥1 allows us to have a term-by-term control of the orthogonal projections
of the convective term, the pressure gradient and the divergence of the elastic stress tensor. This fact may
be an explanation of why we have found the term-by-term stabilization more robust than the residual based
one in the presence of high gradients.

Our first result states the formulation we consider is stable in the working norm (23):

Theorem 1 (Stability). Suppose that H2 holds. For λ small enough, there is a constant C > 0 such that

provided δ0 is taken small enough and the constants ci, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in (18)-(20) are large enough.

Proof. Given Uh ∈ X h, consider Uh1 = ((1− β)uh, (1− β) ph,σh). Using only Schwarz’s inequality we

An important restriction inherited from the continuous case is that the stability of the elastic stresses can
be ensured only for small Weissenberg numbers. In the above expression the factor of the term ‖σh‖

2 must
be strictly positive to guarantee stability. In this factor we have two negative components, the first 2λ ‖∇ah‖
comes from the Galerkin method, and the second 4λασ λ2µ ‖∇

2 from the stabilized formulation. All the

analysis carried out assumes that

The basic idea to prove Theorem 1 is to obtain control on the components on the finite element space for
the terms whose orthogonal component appears in the above expression. The key point is that this control
comes from the Galerkin terms of Bstab in (14).

Let us start considering V h1 = αu (1− β) (Pu,0 (ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh) , 0,0). Recalling that Pu,0
is defined based on elementwise integrals, Pu,0 (ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh) is well defined. We will use the
abbreviation v1 ≡ Pu,0 (ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh). Using Young’s inequality, inverse estimates and (21),
we obtain

all positive for λ (or the Weissenberg number) small enough and the constants ci, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in (18)-(20)
large enough.

Comparing the terms in the right-hand-side of (33) and the definition (23), it is seen that the former
bounds ‖Pu,0 (ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh) ‖ and ‖P⊥ (ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh) ‖. Assumption H2 allows
us to guarantee that it also bounds ‖ρah · ∇uh +∇ph −∇ · σh‖. Therefore, for each Uh we have found V h
such that

Bstab (Uh,V h) ≥ C‖Uh‖2W

In fact, it is seen from (33) that we could have included the term 1
2µ
C12 ‖λPσ (σ̇∗h)‖

2 in the working norm,
which gives control on the finite element part of σh · ∇sah +∇sah · σh.

On the other hand, it is easily checked that ‖V h‖W ≤ C ‖Uh‖W . Using this fact we have shown that for
each Uh ∈ X h there exist V h ∈ X h such that Bstab (Uh,V h) ≥ C ‖Uh‖W ‖V h‖W , from where the theorem
follows. �

Once stability is established, a more or less standard procedure leads to convergence. The objective is to
show that the error function of the method is

This expression allows us to see how the error will deteriorate in terms of the local Reynolds number and
the local Weissenberg number, defined as the factors that multiply ε1,K (u) and ε0,K (σ), respectively.

The first preliminary result we need concerns the consistency of the formulation:

Lemma 1 (Consistency). Let U ∈ X be the solution of the continuous problem and Uh ∈ X h the finite
element solution. If f ∈ Vh and U is regular enough, so that Bstab (U ,V h) is well defined, then

Bstab (U −Uh,V h) ≤ CE (h) ‖V h‖W (35)

for all V h ∈Xh, where E (h) is given by (34).

Proof. Obviously, the Galerkin terms do not contribute to the consistency error. In the constitutive
equation the stabilization term is residual based and the consistency is also satisfied by construction, the
same as in the continuity equation. It only remains to show that S⊥1 has a consistency error bounded as
(35) indicates. This easily follows from the fact that the orthogonal projection P⊥ onto an appropriate finite
element space (without boundary conditions) satisfies ‖P⊥(v)‖ ≤ Cε0(v) for any function v. �

The second preliminary lemma provides an interpolation error in terms of the working norm ‖·‖W and the
stabilized form Bstab for the continuous solution U = [u, p,σ] ∈ X , assumed to have enough regularity:

Lemma 2 (Interpolation error). Let U ∈ X be the solution of the continuous problem, assumed to be
regular enough, and Ũh ∈ X h its best finite element approximation. Then, for λ small enough the following
inequalities hold:

Proof. Set eu = u − ũh, ep = p − p̃h and eσ = σ − σ̃h. The proof of (37) follows from a repeated
application of Schwarz’s inequality and then Young’s inequality for scalars. Boundary terms can be treated
using (21). One gets

for any constants εi, i = 1, 2, 3 (not to be confused with the interpolation errors). Estimate (37) follows from
the definition of the error function in (34) and assuming λ to be small enough (this assumption allows us not
to include the gradient of ah in the error function).

To prove (36) one needs to apply repeatedly Young’s inequality and use the expression of the stabilization
parameters, as well as classical interpolation estimates. To treat the boundary terms, note that according to

We are finally in a position to prove convergence. The proof is standard, but we include it for completeness.

Theorem 2 (Convergence). Let U = [u, p,σ] ∈ X be the solution of the continuous problem, and suppose
that the assumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Then there exist a constant C > 0 such that

‖U −Uh‖W ≤ CE (h)

Proof. Consider the finite element function Ũh −Uh ∈ X h, where as in Lemma 2, Ũh ∈ X h is the best
finite element approximation to U . Starting from the inf-sup condition, it follows that there exist V h ∈ X h
such that

The theorem follows using this bound in the triangle inequality

and (37) in Lemma 2. �
Clearly, this convergence result is optimal.

4.3. Stability and convergence in natural norms

The next step will be to prove stability and convergence in a natural norm, that is yo say, in the norm of
the space where the continuous problem is posed, and not in the mesh dependent norm (23). Even though



18 TITLE WILL BE SET BY THE PUBLISHER

the results to be presented are the expected ones, the analysis presented up to this point has highlighted the
role played by the stabilization terms of the formulation. Obviously, since the natural norm does not include
any control on the convective terms, stability and convergence in this norm is only meaningful in the case
of small cell Reynolds numbers and small cell Weissenberg numbers. This is the situation considered in the
following.

Theorem 3 (Stability and convergence in natural norms). Suppose that the assumptions of Theorem 1 hold
and the cell Reynolds numbers and cell Weissenberg numbers are small. Then, the solution of the discrete
problem Uh = [uh, ph,σh] ∈ X h can be bounded as

Moreover, if the solution of the continuous problem U = [u, p,σ] ∈ X is regular enough, the following error
estimate holds:

To prove the L2-stability for the pressure we rely on the inf-sup condition between the velocity and pressure
spaces that holds for the continuous problem, as in [18]. Details can be found in this reference. This concludes
the proof of the first part of the Theorem.

Let us proceed to prove convergence in natural norms. Theorem 2 implies that

The error estimate in Theorem 3 can now be obtained using the same procedure as in [18], which relies once
again on the inf-sup condition between the velocity and the pressure spaces that holds at the continuous
level. �

To complete the analysis of the problem, let us obtain an L2-error estimate for the velocity field. As usual,
this can be proved using a duality argument and an elliptic regularity condition assuming the forcing term
to be in L2(Ω). The result we have is the following:

Theorem 4 (L2-error estimate for the velocity). Assume that the hypothesis of Theorem 3 hold and suppose
that the continuous problem satisfies the elliptic regularity condition

5. Conclusions

In this paper we have presented the numerical analysis of a finite element approximation of the linearized
viscoelastic flow problem. The formulation in the nonlinear case was presented in the stationary case in [13].
This analysis has confirmed what it was already known from the numerical experiments, namely, that the
method provides stable solutions that converge to the exact solutions at an optimal rate of convergence. In
particular, we have shown this using a mesh dependent norm especially tailored for the stabilized problem
and also the norm of the space where the continuous problem is posed. What is relevant from the analysis
presented is that it clearly displays how the estimates obtained deteriorate as the cell Reynolds number and
the cell Weissenberg number increase. The former decreases when the mesh size is reduced, but the having
a bound on the latter imposes the relaxation time to be very small, which is an indication of the existence of
the so called high Weissenberg number problem.
