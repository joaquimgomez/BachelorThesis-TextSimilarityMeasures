ABSTRACT 

 

A methodology to estimate, in a probabilistic way, the annual cost to society of premature 

deaths because of earthquakes is proposed in this paper. The methodology makes use of 

results obtained by means of prospective and probabilistic seismic risk assessments where, 

expected deaths caused by the collapse of buildings are obtained. Those results, combined 

with demographic and macroeconomic indicators such as the age distribution, life expectancy 

at birth and per capita gross domestic product, are used to estimate the cost to society in terms 

of lost productivity due to premature mortality because of earthquakes. The proposed 

methodology does not attempt to estimate neither assign a cost to human lives at any stage, 

but the one associated to lost productivity at societal level. One of the descriptors of the 

methodology is part of the components of the disability adjusted lost years (DALY), a widely 

used metric in the public health field which estimates the burden of diseases based mostly on 

historical data. As an example, the methodology is applied to Medellín, the second largest city 

of Colombia, finding that the cost of lost productivity due to premature mortality because of 

earthquakes has a similar order of magnitude than the direct physical losses in the public and 

private building stock calculated in a previous probabilistic seismic risk assessment.

INTRODUCTION 

 

An estimated of 720,000 deaths because of more than 460 earthquakes have been recorded 

since 1999 around the world (Guha-Sapir et al 2015). Besides being per se a shocking figure, 

the issue is aggravated with the fact that more than 90% of them have occurred in developing 

countries. It has been largely stated that earthquakes do not kill people but structures that 

collapse do and, poor construction practices besides building codes with low standards and 

enforcement levels can still be found at worldwide level. Probabilistic seismic risk models 

allow the estimation of damages and losses on the exposed assets and, depending on the 

available information also the estimation of casualties, both injured and deaths. Even more, 

the estimation of casualties is considered one of the most important outputs since the main 

purpose of any comprehensive seismic risk management scheme is to protect lives (Olson and 

Wu 2010). 

 

Most of the published seismic risk assessments have estimated damages and losses on the 

exposed elements but there have also been cases where deaths associated to earthquakes 

occurrence have been calculated at different resolution levels (Algermissen et al. 1972; 

McClure et al. 1979; Reitherman 1982; Marulanda et al. 2013; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014a). 

There are also different approaches to estimate deaths, ranging from single-scenario 

approaches where only one event of interest is considered, to fully probabilistic assessments 

where the contributions of several events with different occurrence probabilities are accounted 

for. Anyhow, it has not yet been proposed a way to estimate the impact and consequences of 

those deaths in the society apart of calculating the overall figure. This paper proposes a 

methodology to estimate the cost to society in terms of the lost production due to premature 

mortality because of earthquakes considering demographic and macroeconomic indexes. It is 



5 
 

important to make it clear that the objective of the proposed methodology is not, by any 

means, to assign a value to the lives of the inhabitants of the area under study. 

 

In the public health field, the disability adjusted life year (DALY) is a commonly used metric 

developed in the 1990’s as a measure of disease burden for comparison of overall health and 

life expectancy in different countries. 1 DALY corresponds then to 1 lost year of healthy life. 

According to the methodology proposed by the World Health Organization in the latest 

release of the global burden of disease (WHO 2013) it is estimated by adding two components 

as follows 

 

DALY YLD YLL          (Eq. 1) 

 

where YLD is the adjusted number of years lived with disability and YLL is the number of 

years of life-lost due to premature mortality. YLL is calculated as the number of deaths 

multiplied by the life expectancy at the age of death. The estimation of that metric is based 

mostly on historical data and, therefore, it can be classified as a retrospective one. 

 

Based on one of the ideas behind the DALY, the estimation of the average number of years of 

lost-life due to premature mortality because of earthquakes, YLL, is proposed herein. YLL 

consider only those deaths associated to building collapse by using probabilistic catastrophe 

models (cat-models) instead of historical data, being then a prospective metric. 

 

Regarding YLD, although with state-of-the-art cat-models it is possible to estimate the 

expected number of injured because of earthquakes, it is not possible to accurately make 

estimations of the kind of injuries and therefore, the time either to remission or death. Because 



6 
 

of that, it is not possible to yet estimate YLD due to earthquakes in a prospective way and, 

therefore, it is not included in the estimation of lost production. 

 

In the earthquake engineering field, metrics based on DALYs have been proposed, such as the 

Economic Adjusted Life Years (Scawthorn 2011) which, based on historical earthquake 

monetary loss estimations and average annual wages per capita, made comparative 

assessments of earthquakes occurring between 1906 and 2004. 

 

Considering the participation of all the possible earthquakes in the area under analysis, 

collapse probabilities and fatality rates per building class, the average annual number of 

deaths (AAD) is estimated and, then, based on demographic data such as age distribution and 

life expectancy at birth, the average number of years of lost-life due to premature mortality 

because of earthquakes is estimated. Finally, an order of magnitude, in terms of lost 

productivity associated to the average annual number of years of life-lost due to premature 

mortality is obtained. 

 

The importance to reduce disaster casualties has been acknowledged by the Tokyo 

Metropolitan Government, who has announced to follow specific and measurable risk 

reduction targets to achieve this goal (RMS 2015). The use and development of vulnerability 

functions to estimate deaths associated to earthquakes following the methodology proposed in 

this paper can help to assess the performance of certain goals. 

 

Previous studies have addressed the topic of lost productivity years, number of life-lost years 

and overall lost production using only retrospective approaches for tsunami (Krishnamoorthy 

et al. 2005) and earthquakes (Wang et al. 2008). For the case of tsunami, based on the 



7 
 

December 2004 Sumatra event deaths statistics, a sub-national estimation of YLL was 

performed in India and, based on the working age group and minimum wage figures, the lost 

productivity during one month was calculated. For the case of earthquakes, using the statistics 

of the 2008 Wenchuan event, the effect of injuries in public health of China in terms not only 

of death causes but lost of potential productive years has been highlighted. Finally, a non-

monetary metric to account for the direct impact of natural disasters with different origins was 

introduced by Noy (2014; 2015) and applied at global level based also in disaster databases. 

Although the estimation of the impact in this dimension is very useful, it is also known that 

for catastrophic events the scarce historical data is not enough to have a complete overview of 

the problem and, therefore, prospective and probabilistic approaches such as the used herein 

are proposed.  

 

The results that can be obtained with this methodology can also contribute to raise risk 

awareness, besides allowing the development and promotion of risk mitigation strategies 

through increasing building code compliance in case of new buildings and by promoting 

structural retrofitting schemes for the case of existing ones (at least in buildings classified as 

critical facilities), bearing in mind that the main objective of them is to protect the life of its 

occupants which in an indirect way serves also as a measure to protect wealth and property. 

The results obtained with this proposed methodology should be seen as complementary to the 

ones obtained with the traditional probabilistic risk assessments performed for the built stock. 

Also, since the objective of the methodology is to estimate the lost production, the YLL is 

needed instead of the classical estimation of people killed by earthquakes which are expressed 

in number of deaths. 

 

An application of the proposed methodology is presented for Medellín, Colombia, which is an 



8 
 

urban center with more than two million inhabitants that lies in and intermediate seismic 

hazard zone (AIS 2010). The results of lost productivity are compared against those 

previously estimated for the city that only considered the direct losses on the public and 

private building portfolio (Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b) and it is shown how the ratio between 

the losses is higher than the unit, reason why this proposed approach should also be 

considered within a comprehensive seismic risk management framework. 

 

PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC RISK ASSESSMENT 

 

This section presents a summary of the methodology used for the prospective estimation of 

deaths because of earthquakes. It follows a probabilistic approach from the hazard and 

vulnerability perspective where different requirements need to be fulfilled. 

 

When modeling earthquake risk, one must be aware of the large amount of uncertainties 

related mainly to the hazard and to the vulnerability (Ordaz 2000; Grossi 2004; Murphy et al. 

2011; Marulanda et al. 2013; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2015a). 

Because of that, those uncertainties need to be quantified and rigorously propagated through 

the loss estimation process and it can only be achieved if probabilistic risk models are used. 

The inputs for the risk model can be classified into the following three categories: 1) hazard; 

2) exposure and 3) vulnerability. For the hazard representation, a set of stochastic events that 

contain all the possible ways in which earthquakes may manifest in the area under analysis is 

required. The events need to be collectively exhaustive, mutually exclusive and describe the 

spatial and temporal variation of the hazard. Exposure can be modelled at different resolution 

levels, ranging from coarse grain data such as the used in the Global Assessment Report 2015 

(UNSIDR 2015) to detailed dwelling by dwelling databases; in all cases, an identification and 



9 
 

characterization of the exposed elements is required and attributes such as the construction 

material, number of stories, structural system and number of occupants need to be included. 

Finally, vulnerability functions that relate different hazard intensity levels with the losses in 

the exposed elements are assigned to each building class. Losses can have different 

dimensions such as the one related to the damage in physical infrastructure and the one that 

accounts for the human affection. The latter is the one of interest in the methodology 

proposed herein. 

 

Since it is not possible to directly calculate the probability distribution function of losses 

conditional to the occurrence of an event, the following procedure proposed by Ordaz (2000) 

is used 

 

0

( | ) ( | ) ( | )j i j if l Event f l Sa f Sa Event dSa


       (Eq. 2) 

 

In equation 2, two different conditional probability functions are chained, where the first one 

has to do with the vulnerability (the expected loss given a hazard intensity) and the second 

part with the hazard (the hazard intensity given the occurrence of the event). 

 

One of the most robust probabilistic risk metrics is the average annual loss (AAL) (Marulanda 

2013) which can be computed using the following equation: 

 

1

E( ) ( )
N

i A i
i

AAL L Event F Event

         (Eq. 3) 

 

where E(L|Event i) is the mean loss value given the occurrence of the i
th event and FA(Event i) 



10 
 

is the associated annual occurrence frequency of the same event. This approach requires an 

exhaustive set of hazard events which can be obtained by using probabilistic seismic hazard 

assessment (PSHA) programs like CRISIS2008 (Ordaz et al. 2013). Nevertheless, in some 

cases, seismic hazard information is not available in that representation but in terms of 

intensity exceedance curves (also known as hazard curves) which, in the case of earthquakes 

usually relate acceleration levels with their corresponding annual exceedance rates. Based on 

that information, it is also possible to calculate the AAL by using the following expression: 

 

1 0

( )
( | )

K

i
i

d a
AAL E l a da

da





           (Eq. 4) 

 

In this case ν(a) is the annual hazard intensity exceedance rate, K is the total number of 

exposed assets, a is the hazard intensity and E(l|a) is the expected value of the loss given a 

hazard intensity a in the ith exposed element. If PSHA has been performed in a rigorous and 

exhaustive way, the use of either equations 2 or 3, would lead to the same value of AAL. 

 

Within a probabilistic risk assessment framework, the vulnerability functions allow obtaining 

losses in different dimensions such as monetary losses and casualties. These functions relate 

the expected hazard intensities with the expected consequences and efforts have been made 

worldwide to develop relationships that allow estimating casualties, both in terms of injured 

and deaths, associated to earthquakes (Coburn and Spence 2002; FEMA 2003; Spence and So 

2009; Jaiswal and Wald 2010; Jaiswal et al. 2011) which are based mostly on post-earthquake 

surveys. It is well-known that this is a difficult task since high variability in the number of 

deaths can be observed from event to event, even when dealing with earthquakes of similar 

magnitudes, depths and building stock characteristics. Based on those studies, it has been 



11 
 

possible to define lethality rates by building class to estimate the expected deaths for each 

category. Those rates are estimated as the ratio of death people to building occupants and 

depend on the building class and collapse mechanism, among some other structural 

characteristics. Also, regardless the building class, the fatality rates tend to increase with the 

number of stories. Figure 1 shows the vulnerability function in terms of the expected value of 

lethality rates for high-rise reinforced concrete dwellings as an example. The hazard intensity 

is the spectral acceleration at the fundamental elastic period of the structure which is the 

hazard parameter that better correlates the expected damage and losses (Luco and Cornell 

2007). 

 

Figure 1 Example of deaths vulnerability function for high-rise reinforced concrete dwellings 

 

It is worth mentioning that only indoor mortality is considered with these functions but it is 

also the case where most of the deaths occur, not ignoring that people exposed to failing 

objects outdoors can also be affected.

explained. It is important to mention that the methodology can be applied considering other 

hazards such as tropical cyclones, volcanic ash and tsunami, as long as vulnerability functions 

that allow estimating deaths associated to them can be developed and the available hazard 

representation allows estimating average annual losses. Also, the proposed methodology can 

be applied at different resolution levels, an issue that provides opportunities to estimate the 

cost to society for example at country, subnational and/or local level. 

Estimation of the Average Annual Deaths 

 

Estimation of deaths caused by the collapse of buildings during an earthquake using state-of-

the-art risk models still constitutes a big challenge (Ferreira et al. 2011). It is not only because 

population data to be included in the exposure databases are a dynamic parameter that 

depends on the day, time and even season but also, because the existing casualties’ 

consequences databases provide limited information to develop vulnerability functions in this 

loss dimension for the reasons explained before. The estimated number of deaths due to 

earthquakes at this stage is only associated to building collapse and not to secondary hazards 

like tsunami, landslides and fires. Even if it is also known that this is not the only cause of 

deaths during earthquakes, since other causes like heart attacks also add to the final figure, it 

has been established that almost 90% of the deaths caused by earthquakes around the world 

are due to structural collapse (Coburn and Spence 2002). 

 

The first input to the calculation is the average annual deaths (AAD) because of earthquakes, a 

metric that is based on the same basis and assumptions than the AAL, which can be 

summarized as: 1) it considers the participation of all possible earthquakes; 2) an infinite 

timeframe for the occurrence of the events is assumed and 3) damaged structures are rebuilt or 

repaired to meet the initial conditions after they have been damaged; the same applies to the 



13 
 

human occupation levels. 

 

Analogously to the AAL presented in Equation 3, the AAD because of earthquakes can then be 

obtained and can be computed directly when using an event-based risk assessment by means 

of 

 

1

  (D ) ( )
N

i A i

AAD E Event F Event


                (Eq. 5) 

 

where N is the total number of representative hazard events, FA(Event i) is the annual 

frequency of occurrence of the ith hazard event and E(D|Event i) are the expected deaths 

because of collapse of the exposed assets given that the ith event occurred. In the cases where 

no stochastic representation for the seismic hazard is available, Equation 4 can be used 

bearing in mind that the estimated loss has a human deaths dimension. Since occupancy is a 

dynamic parameter and, neither its daily or seasonal variations can be well established, 

average occupancy rates like the ones proposed by Liel and Dierlein (2012) that account for 

occupancy ratios according to day and time of the day can be used. 

 

If AAD is calculated for other hazards, it can be added arithmetically since it corresponds to 

an expected value. This allows the implementation of the proposed methodology in multi-

hazard risk assessments, suitable for areas where more than one hazard can cause significant 

consequences to its inhabitants. 

 

Age Distribution 

 

Based on censual data, it is possible to establish the age distribution of the inhabitants the area 



14 
 

under analysis. Usually, the data are grouped into age ranges of 5 to 10 years spans and are 

updated on a regular basis. The age distributions to be used in the proposed methodology 

correspond to the most updated at the moment of the analysis. Assuming that there are M age 

ranges, the population distribution can be estimated for each of them and denoted as Pr. A 

uniform age distribution based on the demographic statistics is assumed for the area of 

analysis. Since all the inhabitants fall only into one of the age ranges, the following condition 

is met

It may be argued that the age distribution of the overall population changes with time but, in 

order to be consistent with the probabilistic risk assessment framework used herein, what is 

considered are today’s characteristics. 

 

Average Annual Deaths by Age Range 

 

Based on the Pr and having previously calculated the AAD, it is possible to estimate the AADi 

which corresponds to the average annual deaths by age range, obtained by multiplying the 

total AAD by the correspondent Pr factor. This step assumes that the age distribution of the 

deaths because of earthquakes have the same characteristics as that for the base population, 

which can be considered an appropriate assumption in the case of earthquakes since, in the 

type of injuries that cause deaths, the age factor does not constitute a differential cause. In all 

cases:

Life Expectancy at Birth 

 

Life expectancy at birth is usually available from official sources given its importance in 

different social, security, economic and public health aspects. For the area under analysis a 

unique value for it is needed in this proposed methodology, reason why, if the available 

information is disaggregated by for example, gender or smaller geographical units, a weighted 

average can be calculated. Unitary years of lost-life because any cause by age ranges (Li) can 

be obtained by calculating the difference between the life expectancy at birth and the mean 

value of the age range (i.e. if the age range is 20-24 years, the mean value is 22.5 years). With 

this, it is being assumed that years within each age range are uniformly distributed. Life 

expectancy at birth at the moment of the analysis is to be used again to be consistent with the 

probabilistic risk assessment framework. 

 

Years of Life-Lost due to Premature Mortality Because of Earthquakes 

 

By multiplying Li by AADi, the YLLi are obtained corresponding thus to the average annual 

number of years of life-lost due to premature mortality because of earthquakes by age range. 

Since this is an expected value, it can be arithmetically added and, the sum of the YYLi of the 

M age ranges corresponds to the overall average annual number of years of life-lost due to 

premature mortality because of earthquakes for the area under analysis (YLL)

Average Annual Lost Productivity Cost due to Premature Mortality Because of 

Earthquakes 

 

To relate the average annual number of years of life-lost due to premature mortality because 

of earthquakes with its consequences on production, the gross domestic product (GDP) per 

capita is used. It is widely accepted that GDP is the economic index that best measures 

economic welfare and, that due to the characteristics of an economy it can either represent the 

income of all the members of an economy or the total expenditure in the production of goods 

and services in it. DALYs estimations in some cases have appraised the years according to the 

age, based on the fact that it is during the working-age range that the peak productivity exists 

for each individual; this procedure is known as social weighting (WHO 2004). In this article, 

the estimation of the lost productivity only considers the YLLi associated to the working-age 

population which, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 

Development (OECD), is constituted by those aged 15 to 64 (OECD 2014). Within that range, 

all years are considered to contribute equally to productivity. Therefore, the average annual 

lost productivity due to premature mortality because of earthquakes (AALPYLL) is estimated by 

means of 

 

(15 64) /capitaYLLAALP YLL GDP          (Eq. 9) 

 

It is important to bear in mind that the same assumptions made for the calculation of AAL 

apply to the AALPYLL, from where the most important is, that the estimated cost represents an 

average value which can be interpreted as the long term annualized cost of lost productivity 

due to premature deaths caused by possible earthquakes with different magnitude, depth and 



17 
 

location. This approach also follows the premise that saving a life is independent of the life 

saved. 

 

Both AAD and AALPYLL are relevant risk metrics that cover a dimension which, so far, has not 

been explicitly addressed in a probabilistic and prospective way. In most probabilistic risk 

assessments only direct losses associated to physical damages of the built stock are obtained 

and in some cases used as a basis for the estimation of economic flow variations that account 

for the indirect losses; none of them account for the expected lost productivity due to 

premature mortality and this innovative proposal aims to cover that field which may be of 

special importance in dense population settlements located in earthquake prone regions. The 

estimation of AALPYLL also serves as a basis to estimate the order of magnitude of what a 

society should be willing to spend to protect and save itself against natural disasters 

(Rosenblueth 1976). 

 

The proposed methodology has some limitations that are important to highlight with the 

objective of promoting future research that may contribute to improvements. First, only the 

life-years lost due to premature mortality are considered herein and it would be desirable to be 

able to estimate YLD and assess its impact in terms of lost productivity. Second, deaths 

associated to other damage states different than collapse and occurring outdoors, although 

being a small fraction, if considered will provide a comprehensive framework for deaths 

estimation and subsequent lost productivity assessment. 

 

APPLICATION AT URBAN LEVEL IN MEDELLÍN, COLOMBIA 

 

The proposed methodology is applied to Medellín, Colombia. The city has more than two 



18 
 

million inhabitants and is located on an intermediate seismic hazard zone with peak ground 

accelerations (PGA) of 0.15g associated to a mean return period of 475 years (AIS 2009; 

Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2010; 2015b). The city has complete and high quality information 

regarding the different aspects that are required for the analysis and the results are presented 

herein. 

 

First, the estimation of AAD is performed using the program CAPRA-GIS (ERN-AL 2011) 

which is the probabilistic risk calculator of the CAPRA Platform1 (Cardona et al. 2010, 2012; 

Marulanda et al. 2013; Velásquez et al. 2014). The input data in terms of seismic hazard and 

exposure are the same as those used for the estimation of losses on the building portfolio 

(Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b) but the vulnerability functions, since the loss dimension of 

interest in this case is different, are in terms of lethality rates for each building class. In 

summary, the seismic hazard is estimated at bedrock level and is represented through a set 

with more than 1,800 stochastic events and, spectral transfer functions are also defined for the 

different soil zones to account for the dynamic soil response which is not negligible in the 

city. The public and private building stock has more than 240,000 dwellings with different 

structural characteristics whose details can be found in Salgado-Gálvez et al. (2014b). Urban 

population projected for year 2015 is equal to 2,218,192 inhabitants (DANE and Alcaldía de 

Medellín 2010) and is distributed by buildings considering their main use and making use of 

official population density data. An occupation rate of 60%, following the distributions 

proposed by Liel and Dierlein (2012) has been assumed. This is needed since more than 1,800 

possible earthquakes, with different magnitudes, locations and occurrence frequencies are 

considered in the analysis for which the day and time of occurrence is unknown.

AAD is estimated in 2,187 people for Medellín which in relative terms correspond to 0.99‰ 

of the total population count. Higher values are expected for reinforced concrete buildings of 

medium and high-rise if compared to the non-engineered low-rise structures made of wood 

and zinc that do not cause as many deaths in case of collapse if compared with middle and 

high-rise reinforced concrete frames. 

 

Based on the official demographic information (DANE and Alcaldía de Medellín 2010), age 

distribution by 5 year span ranges is available as shown in Table 1. 

 

Table 1 Age distribution 

 

With this information, it is now possible to estimate AADi as presented in Table 2. As 

explained, the sum of the AADi corresponds to the overall AAD.

Table 2 Average annual deaths by age range 

 
 

Medellín is divided into 16 counties (comunas) that have similar geographical extension but 

different socioeconomic characteristics. Since life expectancy at birth corresponds to a metric 

that has different values even when considering the same urban center because of social, 

safety and public health issues, available data are disaggregated, in this case at county level. 

Since the main objective of the proposed methodology is to make an estimation of the cost 

associated to the lost productivity due to premature mortality because of earthquakes, a single 

value is needed for the city. For that reason, based on the number of inhabitants in each 

county shown in Table 3, a weighted average of the life expectancy at birth estimated in 76.96 

years has been calculated.

At this stage it is possible to estimate the YLLi of earthquakes as shown in Table 4 which, as 

expected, shows lower values for advanced ages if compared with younger ones.

Table 4 Annual years of life-lost due to premature mortality because of earthquake by age range 

 

Sum of the YLLi equals the total number of years of life-lost due to premature mortality 

because the earthquakes (YLL) which in this case corresponds to 86,550. Because the highest 

age range exceeds the life expectancy at birth, it is not added to the final result. Finally, to 

estimate the cost to society of these deaths as lost future productivity, YLL for ages between 

15 and 64 years, equal to 58,589 are multiplied by the GDP per capita. For the case of 

Medellín that value has been established in US$11,466 for 2014 (Brookings Institute 2015). 

With the data for this case study, that value corresponds to US$672 million which is 

approximately 1.1 times the value of the AAL that considers only direct damage to the 

building portfolio (Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b). 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

A methodology to estimate in a probabilistic and prospective way the economic cost in terms 

of lost production of the average annual number of years of life-lost has been presented

herein. This metric can serve as a risk awareness measure, representing a step forward into the 

casualties’ estimation field. The proposed methodology in one hand allows estimating in a 

prospective way the AAD which, when combined with demographic data, allows calculating 

AALPYLL also in a prospective way, to account for the lost production. On the other hand, the 

proposed methodology can also be useful as a complementary metric to traditional risk 

assessments that only consider direct damages and losses to the built infrastructure. Since at 

the end the results of the built stock risk assessments and the AALPYLL are expressed in 

monetary units, it seems reasonable to combine and compare the results to obtain a wider 

overall risk perspective. 

 

AAD, besides being a robust and compact risk metric, is also a flexible one, since its 

estimation can be performed using different representations for the hazard, such as stochastic 

events or hazard curves. On the one hand stochastic events are generally preferred within the 

fully probabilistic risk modeling frameworks but, on the other hand, hazard is still widely 

represented through maps for different mean return periods in several regions of the world, 

from where the hazard curves can be obtained and that information be used for the estimation 

of AAD. 

 

The possibility of estimating the number of life-lost years due to premature mortality because 

of earthquakes and their cost in terms of economic production in a prospective way 

constitutes a novel approach in which its main benefit can be seen as possibilities of 

developing ex-ante measures within a comprehensive disaster risk management scheme. Also, 

since the results are obtained in monetary units, they can be combined with the risk 

assessments which consider only direct damages and losses on the exposed stock to provide a 

more comprehensive catastrophic risk panorama of the area under analysis.

The methodology can be used at different resolution levels as long as the exposure databases 

contain information related to the building typologies and occupation levels. For most cases, 

seismic hazard at bedrock level and vulnerability functions do not require relevant changes 

but if local assessments are to be developed, detailed exposure databases and accounting for 

the dynamic soil response may be needed. National and sub-national assessments of AALPYLL 

can be useful for both the performance assessment of disaster risk reduction actions as well as 

for comparing the overall risk levels. For national and sub-national assessments, the 

assumption of all years contributing the same to productivity may not hold and a 

differentiation or urban and rural areas, economic sectors and working age ranges may be 

needed. 

 

It has been shown in the case study for Medellín that the annual cost of lost production 

associated to that cause can even exceed the one estimated for the direct damages on 

buildings; this can be interpreted as a credible result considering the importance as an 

economic and industrial hub of the city combined with the low seismic risk awareness and 

associated seismic vulnerability of the built stock. 

 

Because in some cases the age distributions and life expectancy at birth are available by 

gender, the methodology can be applied to explore differences among them, serving as a 

comparative measure in a field that has been identified as important in the disaster risk 

management field (Enarson et al. 2007). Also, the inclusion of the YLD estimation in the 

overall lost production is identified as a field of future research where, based on the disaster 

databases for earthquakes a disaggregation of injuries by type, severity and recovery time may 

be obtained. 



25 
 

 

The application of the methodology can be expanded to other hazards and, even more, since 

AAD corresponds to a mathematical expectation, results can be directly added within the 

framework of multi-hazard analysis (Ordaz 2015; Jaimes et al. 2015). This is of special 

importance in areas where low frequency and high impact events associated to different 

origins (i.e. geological, meteorological) can occur and cause deaths.
