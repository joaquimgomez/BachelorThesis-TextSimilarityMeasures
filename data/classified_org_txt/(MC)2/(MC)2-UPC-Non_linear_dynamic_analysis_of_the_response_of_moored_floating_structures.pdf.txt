Abstract

The complexity of the dynamic behaviour of o�shore marine structures re-
quires advanced simulations tools for the accurate assessment of the sea-
keeping behaviour of these devices. The aim of this work is to present a
time-domain model for solving the dynamics of �oating marine devices, sub-
jected to non-linear environmental loads and paying special attention on the
mooring dynamics. First, the formulation of the hydrodynamic approach for
solving the wave-�oater interaction is introduced. Second, the solver of the
mooring dynamics, based on a non-linear Finite Element Method approach,
is presented. Third, a procedure for coupling the hydrodynamic along with
other external loads, with the �oating structure and mooring dynamics is
described. Fourth, some validation examples and comparisons among di�er-
ent mooring approaches are presented. Fifth, an analysis of the OC3 �oating
wind turbine concept is performed to study the in�uence of di�erent mooring
models, the e�ects of non-linear waves on the platform, and the tension in

1. Introduction

Research trends in Marine Renewable Energies (MRE) are mainly focused
in o�shore wind energy due to the high expectations raised by this technology.
The technology for marine wind turbines is currently well-developed, but
limited for �xed installations in shallow-water areas. The next horizon is
focused on deep-water technology [1], but di�erent challenges for Floating
O�shore Wind Turbines (FOWT) are not solved yet [2], such as the dynamic
stability in the presence of non-linear ambient loads [3]. In fact, an accurate
prediction of the dynamic response of a FOWT, considering the interaction
among the hydrodynamics, mooring, and aerodynamics of the turbine, is
identi�ed as one of the key challenges for the simulation tools required to
design the future FOWTs [4, 5, 6].

Standard design procedures and simulation tools for marine structures
come from the existing technology and experience of the o�shore oil and
gas industry. For instance, the classic simulation approaches are based on
uncoupled formulations, where the hydrodynamic response of the �oater is
linearised and can be decoupled from the mooring [7, 8]. Recently, coupled
simulations have been adopted to solve the seakeeping of FOWT devices,
since the dynamic of FOWT o�ers a high complexity due to the variety
of loads and non-linear e�ects. Anyhow, the interaction among di�erent
components, such as the wind turbine structure, the rotor dynamics, the
mooring arrangements and the �oating structure must be taken into account
in a more accurate way [9, 10].

The analysis of FOWT should be carried out with simulation codes capa-
ble to include the physics governing the dynamic response of these devices.
With regards to marine structures, Low and Langley [11] showed that the
dynamic response of a �oating production system in a random sea can be
split in two timescales: low frequency and wave frequency responses. More-
over the seakeeping of the �oating device and the dynamics of the mooring
lines are coupled. Then, the analysis should take into account the interac-

2



tion between them, and the time-domain analysis seems to be the right way
to simulate this sort of coupled problems. In fact, the American Bureau of
Shipping [32] considers that the global seakeeping analysis of a FOWT should
take into account: the unsteady wind loads, wind turbine control systems,
wind turbine-platform interaction, wave actions over the platform, currents,
mooring loads, and any other types of external actions. It will be presented
later on that the time-domain approach allows to handle these actions in a
natural manner.

The �rst works proposing coupled formulations for �oating production
systems were developed for TLP-type platforms [12, 13, 14], where it was
found that the sum-frequency e�ects are important. Also other authors in-
vestigated and developed models to couple di�erent e�ects and loads in �oat-
ing devices [15, 16, 17, 18]. More recently, Cordle and Jonkman [5] made a
review of the state of art of the simulation tools for FOWT. Bae and Kim
[9] recently presented a research on the e�ects of second-order wave exci-
tation in a mono-column-TLP type FOWT comparing with the uncoupled
simulations in time-domain. Karimirad and Moan [19] developed a simpli-
�ed method for the coupled dynamics of a o�shore wind turbine aiming at
saving computational time. They also analysed a spar-type FOWT, and
compared di�erent hydro-elasticity codes [2]. In [3], the dynamic response of
the spar-type platform subject to wave induced excitation was investigated
numerically, including catenary mooring cables. Matha et al. [6] investigated
a platform-tower coupled with a TLP-type FOWT. Jonkman and Sclavounos
[20] presented a tool integrating an aeroelastic model for onshore wind tur-
bines, and a hydrodynamic load model, together with a Quasi-Static (QS)
catenary model for mooring lines. More sophisticated mooring models, which
are usually based on Finite Element Methods (FEM) have been investigated;
for instance, Kim et al. [21] presented a comparison between a linear spring
and a non-linear FEM mooring for the analysis of the dynamic response
when they are coupled with a �oating structure. Several coupled seakeeping
analyses with FEM mooring line models can also be found in the literature
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

Frequency-domain and time-domain approaches are used for seakeeping
analyses of marine structures. However, the frequency-domain approach has
di�culties to accurately handle non-linearities such as those arising from
the mooring lines, and the low frequency components of the wave-body in-
teraction, as appointed by Low [29], while the time-domain analysis can
straightforwardly include any non-linearity within each time step in a natu-

3



ral manner. However, the main drawback of the time-domain is an increase of
the computational time required for the simulations. To overcome this limi-
tation, Low and Langley [11] and Low [29] presented a hybrid time-frequency
domain model to simulate low and wave frequency response of coupled prob-
lems.

In this work, an extension of the time-domain method proposed by Serván-
Camas and García-Espinosa [30, 31] is used. This method obtains a relevant
reduction of the computational time thanks to the use of de�ation tech-
niques and High Performance Computation based on Graphical Processor
Units (GPU). The tool is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and is
able to solve multi-body seakeeping problems on unstructured meshes includ-
ing any type of external load. Other examples of FEM solvers for seakeeping
analysis can be found in the literature. For instance, Hong and Nam [33],
who presented a second-order analysis of wave forces using FEM in the time-
domain, and investigated the interactions with multi-body devices.

This work presents the development of a coupled FEM seakeeping and
mooring models for the analysis of �oating o�shore structures. The model
is able to take into account �rst and the second-order irregular waves, wind
loads, and mooring loads. A novel iterative scheme for coupling the wave
di�raction-radiation solver developed by Serván-Camas and García-Espinosa
[28, 30, 31] with non-linear aerodynamics and mooring loads is also de-
scribed. The paper is organized as follows. First, the governing equations
of the body dynamics are introduced. Second, the second-order di�raction-
radiation wave problem is described. Third, the non-linear FEM model for
mooring lines is introduced in detailed. Fourth, the coupling between the
dynamics of the �oater with non-linear loads, such as mooring lines forces,
is explained. Fifth, some validations with experimental results are shown,
as well as a comparison of the non-linear FEM model with the Quasi-Static
catenary model. Sixth, we analyse an operational case of a spar buoy FOWT
based on the OC3 concept and NREL 5 MW turbine. This case study aims
at evaluating the in�uence of the type of mooring model, as well as the e�ects
of non-linear wave on the dynamics of the platform. Finally, some relevant
conclusions from the obtained results are presented.

2. Problem statement

2.1. General dynamics of �oater

The motion of a �oater subject to ambient loads can be modelled using
the rigid body dynamics. Let OXYZ be a �xed global frame of reference,
and let Gxyz be a local frame of reference located at the center of gravity,
and whose axis are parallel to the axis of the global frame (see Fig. 1).
Assuming small rotations, for each time step, the body accelerations can be
obtained respect to the local frame from the rigid-body dynamic equations:

Mb · ẍ = f (t) , (1)
¯̄Ib · r̈b = m (t) , (2)

where Mb is the mass matrix, ẍ is the linear acceleration vector ,
¯̄Ib is the

instantaneous inertia tensor, f (t) and m (t) are the external loads vector
(hydrostatics, wave loading, mooring, wind, etc.) and the external moments
respectively; �nally r̈b is the angular acceleration vector.

The calculation of the external forces f (t) over the body constitutes an
essential part of the dynamics, and will be described in more detailed later
on.

2.2. Flow equation and boundary value problem

Assuming incompressible and irrotational �ow in a domain Ω, being Γb the
wetted surface of the �oating device, the wave problem governing equations
are [28]:

where ϕ is the velocity potential, ξ is the free surface elevation, g is the

ξ is the wave elevation, Pb is a pressure at a point over body, vϕ is the �uid
velocity, vb is the local velocity at a point on the wetted body surface, n is
the vector normal to the body wetted surface (pointing upward this surface),
and zb is the vertical coordinate of any point of the body.

2.3. Second-order di�raction-radiation governing equations

The governing equations for the second-order di�raction-radiation wave
problem are obtained applying Taylor expansion on the boundary surfaces
of a time-independent domain. This approach allows to approximate the
free surface on z = ζ and the mean body surface Γ0b at time t. Then, a
perturbed solutions based on Stokes expansion procedure is applied to the
velocity potential, free surface elevation, and body motion. More details can
be found in [28].

The solution can be decomposed as

ϕ = ψ + θ, (8)

ξ = η + ζ, (9)

where ψ is the incident wave velocity potential, θ is the di�raction-radiation
wave velocity potential, η is the incident wave elevation, and ζ is the di�raction-
radiation wave elevation. Then, the wave di�raction-radiation governing
equations up to second-order are [28]:

2.4. Second-order wave loads

With regards to the ambient loads applied over wetted body surface, hy-
drodynamic wave forces and moments can be obtained directly from pressure
integration over the wetted body surface. Thus, it can be written that

3. Non-linear FEM model for mooring dynamics

3.1. Equations for cable dynamics

The dynamic equations for a mooring cable with length L with negligible
bending and torsional sti�ness can be formulated as [34, 35]

(ρwCmA0 + ρ0)
∂2rl

where ρw is the water density, Cm is the added mass coe�cient, ρ0 is the
mass per unit length of the unstretched cable, rl is the position vector, E
is the Young's modulus, A0 is the cross-sectional area of the cable, e is the
strain, f are the external loads applied on the cable, and l is the length along
the unstretched cable.

The boundary conditions are given by

∂2rl
∂t2

= 0 l = 0 (at the anchor connection point) , (18)

∂2rl
∂t2

= r̈fl l = L (at the fairlead connection point) , (19)

where r̈fl is the second derivative of the position vector at the fairlead con-
nection point. The external loads acting on the cable, considered in this
work, are the self-weight of the cable, hydrostatic loads, drag forces [36], and
seabed interaction.

3.2. Seabed interaction

When the cable undergoes an excitation, the part which lies between the
anchor and the touchdown point interacts with the seabed. This interaction
is a complex non-linear e�ect. In this work, the seabed-mooring interaction is
modelled as a spring-damping system [37, 38], and is implemented as follows:

1. The vertical forces due to the sti�ness of the seabed in each time step
are calculated as

otherwise, (21)

where cl > 1 is a coe�cient limiting the seabed reactions, ll is the
portion of the cable resting on the seabed, w is the weight per unit of
length of the line, w is the apparent weight of the cable, β is the term
related to the numerical integration of the dynamic FEM model, z is
the vertical coordinate of the cable, Gs is the seabed sti�ness, Ac is the
contact area of the line, and ∆t is the time step. The term zr is de�ned
as

zr = z +

where D is the diameter of line.
The term zr can be de�ned as a limit of the line subsidence.

being γ a term related to the numerical scheme adopted. In addition
dl is expressed as

where ςl is the seabed damping [39].
3. Finally, the horizontal forces due to the seabed interaction are modelled

, (x− direction), (26)

dl

The algorithm developed to solve the mooring dynamics is described next.

3.3. Non-linear FEM algorithm solution

Truss elements, with just three translational degrees of freedom per node,
are used for modelling the mooring lines, since bending e�ects can be ne-
glected in most of cases [7, 40]. In this work, a FEM approach combined
with an updated Lagrange formulation is used for describing the dynamics
of the mooring cable. Some authors showed that the corotational formulation
can get a better performance than the updated formulation. However some
instabilities and lack of convergence can appear. Figure 2 shows a scheme of
the discretization adopted in this work.

Figure 2: Scheme showing the general approach adopted for the spatial discretization of
the cable mooring.

Applying the standard FEM formulation for the non-linear elastodynam-
ics problems [41], the equations for the dynamic equilibrium of the forces on
a cable for each time step ∆t+ t can be written as

f t+∆t = Mt+∆t · ẍ+ Ct+∆t · ẋ+ P0 + Rt+∆t, (28)

where f are the external loads vector, M is a consistent mass matrix of the
line, considering inertia and added mass, P0 is the pretension vector in the
initial con�guration, andR is the internal forces vector of the cable. Damping
e�ects of the mooring cable are introduced through a Rayleigh proportional

10



damping matrix of C. The application of the non-linear FEM approach to
the cable equation can be found in [41, 42].

Considering the linearization of the current con�guration, Eq. (28) can
be expressed as

f t+∆t = Mt+∆t · ẍ+ Ct+∆t · ẋ+
(
Kt+∆tL + K

t+∆t
NL

)
· δx+ P0 + Rt, (29)

where KL and KNL are called the material sti�ness matrix and the geomet-
ric sti�ness matrix, respectively, in the FEM literature [41, 42]. The sum of
both matrices is the so-called tangent sti�ness matrix. The geometric part
of the sti�ness matrix is considered as non-linear since no material proper-
ties appear, and it depends of the Second-Piola stress tensor of the current
con�guration. Incremental displacement of the cable nodes is δx.

An implicit Bossak-Newmark [43] time integration scheme is applied for
the time-integration of the Eq. (29). This provides a set of algebraic equa-
tions to be solved iteratively,

where ∆t is the time step, i denotes the ith iteration, α is a parameter
concerned with the Bossak-Newmark implicit method, and γ and β are pa-
rameters related to the Newmark time integration scheme.

The new position and velocity of each node in each time step can be
expressed as (see Fig. 3)

. (32)

It can be highlighted that multi-segmented mooring systems can be solved
with this approach, and the equilibrium between two or more mooring ca-
bles is determined using the Newton-Raphson method. A criterion based on
the maximum di�erence between the position reached by the nodes in two
consecutive iterations is applied to evaluate the convergence of the algorithm.

Figure 3: General approach to algorithm for solving the �oater dynamics.

The iterative procedure for solving the cable dynamics can be summarized
as

1. Setting the problem statement and boundary conditions, as well as the
initial equilibrium con�guration, of the mooring line. For instance, ini-
tial position based on a static catenary with touchdown can be chosen.
Then, the tension obtained in this preliminary calculation is used as
an initial pretension of the line P0.

2. Evaluation of mass, damping, and tangent sti�ness matrices. The pro-
cedure to calculate the tangent sti�ness matrix can be found in [44].

3. Estimation of forces in each node of the cable at t+∆t, including drag,
seabed interaction, hydrostatic, and gravity loads.

4. Solving the cable dynamic Eqs. (31-32) in order to obtain the new
position of the cable nodes.

12



5. Iteration from the step 2 through 4 until convergence is reached for
each element of the line. In this work an Aitken's ∆2 method is used
to accelerate the iterative algorithm [45].

4. Algorithm to solve the �oater dynamics

Most of the models found in the literature to solve the coupled mooring-
body dynamics use a frequency domain analysis of the �oater together with
a convolution integral [46] for solving the motions of the coupled system
[9, 20, 19]. The most common approach is based on a frequency-domain
di�raction-radiation solver based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM)
combined with a FEM model to solve the mooring dynamics. In this work, a
di�erent approach based on a time-domain FEM seakeeping model recently
presented [30, 31] is proposed. This approach allows to straightforwardly
couple the seakeeping of the �oater with non-linear loads.

Figure 4: Validation of the non-linear FEM mooring model. Case 1: cable under its self
weight.

The algorithm used in this work to solve the dynamics of the coupled
system is presented in Fig. 3. In order to accelerate the solution of the non-
linear solver, it includes two nested loops; the external loop iterates on the
wave di�raction-radiation problem, while the internal loop takes into account
the remaining external forces vector acting on the body. In this �gure F0 are
the external forces di�erent from the hydrodynamic and the mooring forces,

13



and KM is the matrix of the linearised mooring. The procedure to carry out
the coupled analysis is as follows:

1. For each iteration k of the solver loop, the wave di�raction-radiation
problem is solved using the body velocities obtained previously, within
the l iteration, in the body dynamics loop (see Fig. 4).

2. On the one hand, once the velocity potential ϕ is known, hydrodynamic
loads are computed. On the other hand, the sti�ness matrix of the
mooring lines are obtained by means of the Jacobian matrix for the
current position of the fairlead points. Those matrixes are used to
estimate the mooring forces within the inner loop of the dynamic solver.

3. The hydrodynamic loads and the mooring sti�ness matrix are sent to
the body dynamic loop l.

4. For each iteration l of the body dynamics loop, the body dynamic
equations are solved.

where fmooring is the restoring force vector of the mooring cables.
5. Then, the body position and velocity are sent to the solver loop and in-

troduced in the boundary conditions for the wave di�raction-radiation
problem.

6. The solver loops iterate until convergence is reached.
7. Once the solver loop converges, it is proceeded to the calculation of the

next time step.

4.1. Coupling between rigid body motions and non-linear FEM mooring

As mentioned above, the cable dynamics is formulated in term of the
acceleration, and this is also valid for the boundary condition of the fairlead
connection point. A linear approximation to evaluate the end node acceler-
ation based on the prescribed displacement is proposed in this work. Each
time step is divided in n sub-interval, that is to say, ∆t/n. So, in the i-th
time step, the acceleration of end node ful�lls the following compatibility

Above formulation for the boundary condition at the fairlead point has
shown a better stability for the dynamics solver than higher order approxi-
mations.

As it was presented in the previous section, in the �rst l iteration of the
dynamic loop, the sti�ness matrix of the cable KM is estimated by obtaining
the Jacobian of the reaction forces using numerical di�erentiation,

KM =


 ∂Rx/∂x ∂Rx/∂y ∂Rx/∂z∂Ry/∂x ∂Ry/∂y ∂Ry/∂z
∂Rz/∂x ∂Rz/∂y ∂Rz/∂z


 , (36)

where R is the reaction of the mooring cable at the fairlead point. Thus,
the cable response is linearised within each time step ∆t, by estimating the
mooring restoring forces as

fx = Rx + k11∆x+ k12∆y + k13∆z, (37)

fy = Ry + k21∆x+ k22∆y + k23∆z,

fz = Rz + k31∆x+ k32∆y + k33∆z,

where the terms kij correspond to a linear sti�ness matrix, and ∆x, ∆y
and ∆z are the displacements of the fairlead point from the position at the
beginning of the current time step.

5. Validation of the non-linear FEM mooring model

In this section some validation examples of the non-linear FEM model
are presented.

Case 1: Cable under its self weight. The �rst case is based on that
presented in [47]. It consists of an isolated cable, with �xed ends, subjected
to its own weight (see Fig. 4). Initially the cable has a �at form. The
expected deformation is a U form, and the reactions at the ends must be
equal to the cable weight. The properties of the cable are: the sti�ness

15



EA = 50 N, the weight per unit length w = 0.4 N/m, and 14.1421 m of
span length. The cable is discretized into twenty-two bar elements, and the
time step adopted is 0.014 s. Figure 5 shows di�erent positions of the cable
until it gets the expected U form. Note that a damping increment leads to a
faster convergence of the stationary solution. The reactions at end points are
3.4681, and the maximum de�ection (0.715 m) is reached at X = 7.07105 m.

Case 2: Free vibration cable. The second case is based on that proposed
by [48]. The experiment consists of a cable initially in a horizontal position,
and letting one end free and leaving the cable evolve under gravitational
loads. The computed results are compared with the experimental results
taken from [48], as well as with the data obtained from simulation with the
FEM structural solver RamSeries (www.compassis.com). The properties of
the cable are: length L = 1.0 m, sti�ness EA = 50 N, weight per unit of
length w = 0.98 N/m, and 0.881 m distance between the cable end points.
The cable was divided into forty four bar elements, and the time step adopted
was 0.001 s. This time step must be low enough for obtaining an accurate
description of the cable motion. The obtained numerical results show a good
agreement between our results, and those experimentally and numerically
obtained by other authors. The cable position at di�erent times obtained
from computed results can be observed in Fig. 6.

[48] and numerical computed with RamSeries.

Slight di�erences can be appreciated at the lower end in Fig. 7. This fact
can be explained by the di�erent numerical parameters chosen to carry out
the simulation.

Case 3: Cable attached to a circular rotating plate. Now, results
obtained by the developed FEM solver are compared for the model test pro-
posed by Lindhal and Sjoberg [38, 39]. The experimental set up is shown in
Fig. 8. The lower end was attached to the concrete �oor and the upper end
was attached to a circular plate with a �xed rotation speed. The radius of
the circular motion was 0.2 m. Two cases with di�erent rotational periods
of Tr = 1.25 s and Tr = 3.5 s respectively, were investigated. The reaction
forces at the top end of the cable are measured and compared with those
computed by the proposed numerical model.

19



Figure 9: Validation of the non-linear FEM mooring model. Case 3: comparison between
the experimental and numerical cable top end reaction forces. Rotational period Tr = 3.5
s.

The properties of the cable are: length L = 33 m, sti�ness EA = 104 N,
weight per unit length w = 0.18 N/m, and diameter D = 10−3 m. In this
validation case, the cable is discretized into 200 bar elements, and the time
step adopted is 0.001 s. The motion of the top end is de�ned by the following
expressions (including an initialization period to build up the spinning of the
plate):

x (t) = 0.2 · tanh

The results are compared with the experimental results taken from [38]. A
good agreement between the computed reaction forces and the experimental
results [38] can be observed in Fig. 9 (for Tr = 3.5 s), and 10 (for Tr = 1.25 s)
for both, the maximum values and the time evolution. Only slight di�erences
are appreciated due to the uncertainty of the experimental data. The entire
cable loses sti�ness at some instants in time, and the numerical oscillations
after the slack are larger in the case of the larger excitation frequency, as it
was observed by [39].

6. Demonstration of the coupled seakeeping-mooring solver

A fully coupled analysis of the OC3 spar buoy o�shore wind turbine,
called Hywind (www.ieawind.org/task23/) is presented next. Main partic-
ulars of the spar buoy FOWT are presented in [52, 53]. A general view of
the buoy concept can be observed in Fig. 11. In this section, several analysis
are made:

21

• The Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) are compared for a rigid
wind turbine with no wind loads, with those obtained by other authors
[49].

• The analysis of a spar wind turbine subjected to di�erent monochro-
matic waves with periods close to the pitch resonance. The e�ects
of the linear, the quasi-static, and the dynamic mooring models are
compared.

• A simulation in real operational conditions of the spar FOWT OC3 is
performed. First and second-order irregular waves, real wind �ow, and
mooring loads (with three di�erent types of mooring models) are taken
into account. The in�uence of the mooring type model, the e�ects of
second-order wave, and mooring tensions are studied.

22



6.1. RAO analysis and comparison

First, a RAO analysis is performed in the absence of wind. The fre-
quency results of the seakeeping solver are obtained after applying a Fourier
transform to the time history generated. Figure 12 shows an inter-code com-
parison. Note that a good agreement among the di�erent solvers is found
[49].

23

with those taken from other authors [49] for a rigid wind turbine with no wind.

6.2. Mooring analysis around pitch resonance

Below, the in�uence of three di�erent mooring models on the OC3 spar
buoy FOWT is analysed. These models are: the linear model cable (that
behaves as springs and is represented by a linearised mooring matrix [53]);
the Quasi-Static model, similar to the one presented in [54]; and the dynamic
model developed in this work. Six �rst-order monochromatic waves are used
in the analysis. Key parameters of the mooring layout and cable properties
can be found in Table 1. Fig. 13 compares the pitch motion for each mooring
model.

Table 1: Key parameters of pitch resonance study [53].
Item Value Unit

Wave Amplitude 1.0 m

Wave Period analysed 10; 25; 20; 35; 40; 55 s

Number of Mooring Lines 3

Angle Between Adjacent Lines 120 deg

Depth to Anchors Below SWL 320 m

Depth to Fairleads Below SWL 70 m

Radius to Fairleads from Platform Centerline 853.9 m

Unstretched Mooring Line Length 902.2 m

Mooring Line Diameter 0.9 m

Mooring Line Mass Density 77.71 kg/m

Mooring Line Extensional Sti�ness 3.84×108 N

It can be observed that there are big di�erences in the results in those
cases close to the pitch resonance (about Tw = 30 s), while the results are
quite similar for the cases with Tw = 10 s and Tw = 55 s. These results
suggest that the use of simpler mooring models can lead to big errors near
the resonance frequency, and as a consequence to magnify safety factors,
contributing to increase the cost of the FOWT.

6.3. Simulation in operational conditions

Finally, four analyses of the OC3 spar buoy in operational conditions are
presented. The di�erent analyses are carried out in similar environmental
conditions, but using �rst and second-order irregular waves. Furthermore,
additional studies including Quasi-Static and dynamic mooring models are

25



performed. The goal of these analyses is to evaluate the e�ects of the mooring
model and the wave order on the dynamics of the system, as well as to esti-
mate the tension in the mooring lines. On the one hand, the wind turbine
system is assumed to be operating at an average wind speed of 11.4 m/s,
which generates the maximum thrust and torque. FASTLognoter [50, 51]
has been used to linearise with FAST [50] the behaviour of the wind turbine
around the operating wind speed. Restoration and damping matrices result-
ing from the linearisation of the wind turbine system are included into the
global dynamics. It should be remarked that the rotational and periodicity
e�ects are considered in the calculation of the steady state matrix. On the
other hand, the wind loads are estimated considering non-uniform wind �ow,
with an average wind speed of 11.4 m/s. The wind �ow pro�le is obtained
using Turbsim [55], and the wind loads on the wind turbine are obtained
from FAST/AeroDyn [50].

A JONSWAP spectrum with a mean wave period Tm= 12.0 s, and sig-
ni�cant wave height Hs= 6.0 m, is simulated. The key parameters of the
di�erent case studies are presented in Table 2. As stated above, two di�erent
types of mooring models are analysed; one based on the Quasi-Static cate-
nary model [54], and the other based on the dynamic (NFEM) cable model,
presented in this work. For the dynamic cable analysis each mooring line is
divided into 200 bar elements.

Figures 14, 15 and 16 show the computed heave, roll and pitch motions
from 600 s to 900 s of simulation time. Noticeable di�erences are found
between the �rst and the second-order movements, while the QS and NFEM
mooring models o�er quite similar results.

Table 3 shows the mean and RMS values, as well as the motion amplitude
for the �rst and second-order movements. When comparing the QS and the

27



NFEMmodels, only slight di�erences are observed. In particular, the second-
order pitch motion is higher when using the NFEM model, compared to the
QS model, while the other values remain with similar trends for both models.

Figure 17 shows the tension for each mooring line at the fairlead point.
The NFEM model recorded larger amplitude oscillations (in the range of 5
s to 10 s period) compared with QS model. The di�erences observed in Fig.
17 in the tension amplitude reach up to 24 %. This fact suggests that using
a QS model for fatigue assessment of the mooring lines could overestimate
their fatigue life.

Table 4 compares the maximum, minimum, average, and RMS tension
values at the fairlead points, obtaining similar values for both mooring mod-
els. Furthermore, based on Figure 17, the second-order simulation provided
larger tension values than the �rst-order. This result suggests that a �rst-
order approximation can underestimate the fatigue loads and might lead to
a wrong mooring design.

It is emphasized that the NFEM mooring model allows to consider non-
linear dynamic e�ects which cannot be taken into account by QS models.
However, in deep water, the dynamics of catenary mooring lines are negligible
as reported in [11].

7. Conclusions

A FEM coupled seakeeping and mooring model for the analysis of �oating
wind turbines is presented. Based on the results obtained in this work, the
following conclusions are made:

• A second-order time-domain seakeeping model based on FEM and ca-
pable of using unstructured meshes [28, 30, 31] is successfully applied
to simulate �oating wind turbines.

• A dynamic cable model based on Non-linear FEM is presented. A
Lagrangian formulation is used to describe the dynamics of the moor-
ing line. Several non-linear e�ects are considered, such as seabed in-
teraction and drag forces. In order to accelerate the body dynamics
convergence, the restoring mooring forces on the �oating structure are
linearised for each iteration within each time step. Therefore, a sti�ness
matrix has to be evaluated for each iteration.

32



• An algorithm is developed to couple the non-linear cable dynamics with
the body dynamics solver within the time-domain seakeeping solver
[28].

• The dynamic cable model presented in this work is validated against
several experimental results, obtaining a good agreement between the
numerical and experimental ones.

• Di�erent analyses of a FOWT based on the Hywind concept [52, 53]
are performed. RAO curves are compared with those obtained by other
authors, showing a good agreement. Moreover, a comparison among
the linear, the QS, and the NFEM models are carried out for frequen-
cies around pitch resonance, obtaining large di�erences among mooring
models.

• The Hywind FOWT is analysed under a realistic operational condi-
tion. Second-order coupled simulations are carried out considering a
real wind pro�le, and with two types of mooring models; the QS and
the NFEM. Results from both cases are compared. The NFEM moor-
ing model combined with second-order waves and real wind provides
a realistic simulation of the performance of the �oating wind turbine.
The comparison suggests that using a QS model for fatigue assessment
of the mooring lines could overestimate their fatigue life. Further-
more, �rst-order approximation can underestimate tension values on
the mooring systems.
