Abstract 
 
     We propose a new activity on verification and validation (V&V) of MHD codes presently 
employed by the fusion community as a predictive capability tool for liquid metal cooling 
applications, such as liquid metal blankets. The important steps in the development of MHD 
codes starting from the 1970s are outlined first and then basic MHD codes, which are currently in 
use by designers of liquid breeder blankets, are reviewed. A benchmark database of five problems 
has been proposed to cover a wide range of MHD flows from laminar fully developed to turbulent 
flows, which are of interest for fusion applications: (A) 2D fully developed laminar steady MHD 
flow, (B) 3D laminar, steady developing MHD flow in a non-uniform magnetic field, (C) quasi-
two-dimensional MHD turbulent flow, (D) 3D turbulent MHD flow, and (E) MHD flow with heat 
transfer (buoyant convection).  Finally, we introduce important details of the proposed activities, 
such as basic V&V rules and schedule. The main goal of the present paper is to help in 
establishing an efficient V&V framework and to initiate benchmarking among interested parties. 
The comparison results computed by the codes against analytical solutions and trusted 
experimental and numerical data as well as code-to-code comparisons will be presented and 
analyzed in companion paper/papers.

1. Introduction 
 
     This paper is a follow up of a talk given by the first author at the IEA Liquid Breeder 
Blanket (LBB) Workshop in Barcelona, Spain on Sep. 21, 2013 about a new initiative 
aiming at verification and validation (V&V) of MHD codes, which have recently been 
used as a design/analysis tool for fusion applications, first of all, for liquid metal (LM) 
breeding blankets. There were about 40 attendees from the US, EU, Japan, China, Russia, 
India and Korea involved in liquid breeder activities in their countries, in particular in 
development of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) codes. As a result of the subsequent 
round-table discussion, the participants had established a work group, agreed about basic 
V&V rules and the schedule and finally recommended a set of test cases for the 
upcoming benchmark activities. 
     The paper outlines major steps in development of MHD codes starting from the 1970s, 
summarizes the most important goals of the proposed test activities, introduces major 
MHD codes presently employed by the fusion community, selects five benchmark cases 
for laminar and turbulent MHD flows, and gives recommendations on how the testing of 
the codes could be organized among the participants. We also review earlier code 
benchmarking activities [1] for hydrodynamic flows. The main goal of the present paper 
is therefore to help in establishing an efficient framework for V&V of MHD codes for 
fusion applications. Results of the proposed testing will be reported in the next 
companion paper/papers when the test cases are complited by the performers. The 
expected duration of the proposed test studies is about one year from the moment when 
this paper is published.  
     This publication, as the title implies, is primarily concerned with verification and 
validation. These two terms are often confused especially when applied to computational 
fluid dynamics (CFD). Based on the AIAA glossary for CFD [2], verification is defined 
as the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the 
developer’s conceptual description of the model and the solution to the model. In other 
words, verification can be described as “solving the equations right”. Validation is 
defined as the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate 
representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. 
Validation has also been described as “solving the right equations”. CFD benchmarking 
is the key approach used to verify and validate a code, which includes the comparison of 
numerical data produced by a code with reference values, which are commonly accepted 
by the CFD community. Code benchmarking can include comparisons with experimental 
data or testing against trusted numerical data or analytical solutions. 
     The main objectives of the proposed activities on V&V of MHD codes for fusion 
applications, as agreed among the participants of the LBB workshop in Barcelona, are the 
following: 
 

• To help the code developers to improve their computational tools via code-to-
code comparisons as well as benchmarking against available analytical solutions 
and existing and near-future experimental data and also against trusted numerical 
data. 

• To establish a benchmark database. 
• To share information about recent code development. 



• To attract more attention in the fusion community to problems and difficulties in 
developing fusion-relevant MHD codes as a tool for LM blanket design and 
analysis. 

• To educate current and potential users about code capabilities and limitations to 
encourage “critical thinking” and “thoughtful approach” when applying MHD 
codes to fusion problems. 

• To start developing a policy on the control of computational quality, in particular 
to provide reviewers of fusion journals with a set of criteria by which the 
reviewers can judge the quality of publications in the area of computational MHD 
(CMHD).    

 
2. MHD modeling background 

 
     At present, there is a critical demand in the fusion community for effective MHD 
codes that could be (i) used for LBB design and analysis and (ii) implemented in 
integrated modeling tools to address multiple physical effects in blanket flows. 
Unfortunately, only a few large MHD codes are presently available for blanket 
applications, which are, in fact, less mature than ordinary CFD codes. Their applicability 
to the full-scale fusion problems is still limited by the magnetic field strength, flow 
velocity and geometrical complexity. These limitations can be illustrated with a simple 
diagram (Fig. 1), which shows the progress in the MHD code development in terms of 
the dimensionless magnetic field strength, Hartmann number, defined as 

0 /Ha B L σ νρ= , where 0B  is the strength of the applied magnetic field, is the cross-
sectional dimension of the flow-carrying duct, 

L
σ is the electrical conductivity of the 

working fluid, and ν  and ρ are the fluid kinematic viscosity and density. For flows in a 
rectangular duct, which is a key geometrical element of any LM blanket design, the duct 
half-width b in the direction of the applied magnetic field is typically used as the length-
scale: L=b. Hartmann number squared is also interpreted as the ratio between MHD and 
viscous forces.  MHD computations were pioneered in the 1970s but at that time were 
limited to Hartmann numbers of a few tens [3]. The computations progressed quickly 
over the next three decades reaching Hartmann numbers on the order of hundreds in the 
late 1980s (e.g., [4]) and a few thousands  recently [5]. Significant acceleration in MHD 
computations can be seen at around 2005 due to development of a new consistent and 
conservative scheme [6]. However, the progress has been different between simple 
geometry flows (e.g. in a straight rectangular duct) and more complex flows in blanket-
relevant geometries, such as manifolds, contractions, expansions, bends, etc as also 
shown in Fig. 1. Although high values of the flow parameters can be achieved in present 
computations for simple flow geometries (e.g. Ha~104 in the case of fully developed 
flows in a duct), computations for complex geometries are still limited to significantly 
lower values.  
     Typically, MHD flows in a LM blanket are coupled with heat and mass transfer and 
demonstrate various unsteady features, including instabilities and MHD turbulence. In 
addition to the Hartmann number, other important relevant parameters are: the Grashof 
number that characterizes buoyancy forces relative to inertia forces  (23 /νβ TLgGr Δ= β  
is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, g is acceleration of gravity, and TΔ is a 



characteristic temperature difference in the fluid), and the hydrodynamic Reynolds 
number (ratio of inertia to viscous forces) defined through the mean bulk velocity Um as 
Re=UmL/ν . Present computations for 3D MHD flows with buoyancy forces are limited to 
Gr~108, while the target value for blanket applications is Gr~1012 [7]. The Hartmann and 
the Reynolds numbers are often grouped together in the form of the interaction 
parameter , which is the ratio between MHD and inertia forces. Another 
important parameter is the wall conductance ratio w wc

D codes was 

fusion needs on the part of MHD applications, is to achieve high Hartmann (~104), 
Reynolds (~104) and Grashof (~1012) numbers for complex 3D geometries and multi-
material domains [7]. The required codes should allow computations for unsteady 
(including turbulent) and developing flows and to couple MHD with heat and mass 
transfer. It is obvious that these goals cannot be realized without intensive code testing, 
which in turn will require a benchmark database.  
 

 

as described in [1]. The objective of this exercise was to provide the engineering and 
scientific community with a common reference point for evaluation of commercial CFD 
codes. A series of five benchmark simulations was completed using eight commercial 
CFD codes. These simulations were performed by the vendors themselves, and then 
reported in CFD forums. The first group of benchmarks consisted of three laminar flow 



problems. These were the steady, 2D flow over a backward-facing step, the low Reynolds 
number flow around a circular cylinder, and the unsteady 3D flow in a shear-driven 
cubical cavity. The second group of benchmarks consisted of two turbulent flow 
problems: first, for unsteady, 2D turbulent flow around a square cylinder, and second, for 
a 3D spatially-developing flow in a 180-degree bend. All simulation results were 
evaluated against existing experimental data. Each vendor was given approximately five 
months to perform the simulations and write a summary paper. Although twenty vendors 
were invited, only eight vendors agreed to participate in the exercise. Only two vendors 
completed both laminar and turbulent cases. In general, the codes that completed the first 
two 2D laminar simulations gave acceptable results, when the codes were applied 
correctly. However, some of the vendors demonstrated the general lack of insight brought 
to the solution process. That is, some vendors were satisfied with solutions generated at a 
single grid resolution, never attempting to demonstrate a grid convergent solution. The 
third benchmark problem, the unsteady 3D flow in a cavity, requires a spatial 
discretization scheme that minimizes numerical diffusion. With numerical diffusion 
present, the moderate scale, secondary motions never develop, i.e., the Görtler vortices. 
In some of the simulations performed, Görtler vortices were not predicted or sufficiently 
resolved by the grid. And again, some of the vendors simply did not demonstrate any 
insight into the solution of the problem. Regarding the two turbulent flow benchmark 
simulations in this exercise, most of the vendors refused, motivating their decision by the 
fact that the proposed cases are beyond present CFD capabilities. Those who performed 
the tests demonstrated greater insight into the problem solution and, in some cases did 
solve the problems on multiple grids with significantly different resolutions. 
     

4. Review of available MHD codes utilized by fusion community 

   All MHD codes, which are at present utilized for LM blanket applications run into 

assive non-commercial “home-made” solvers, which are 

 
  
three major groups. The first one is comprised of commercial multi-purpose CFD codes 
with a built-in or user-defined MHD module. Four typical examples of such codes are 
FLUENT (now a part of ANSYS), CFX (also a part of ANSYS), SC/TETRA by 
CRADLE and FLUIDYN by TRANSOFT International. Another code, which can be 
added to this group, is OpenFOAM, an open-source multi-purpose CFD toolbox with a 
built-in electromagnetic module developed by OpenCFD Ltd at ESI Group and 
distributed by the OpenFOAM Foundation. It should be stressed that even though 
hydrodynamic solvers in the above tools have been brought to the point where they are 
useful in engineering design, the MHD components of these codes are still not mature 
and need many improvements.  
     The second group includes m
specially developed for MHD applications. Among such codes are HIMAG (USA) [8], 
MTC (China) [9] and FEMPAR (Spain) [10]. Unlike many commercial codes, these 
codes are relatively new, have not been fully validated, don’t have a convenient user 
interface and often need to be modified to meet specifications of a particular problem. 
The advantages of such codes are: their focus on MHD problems and flexibility 
compared to “black-box” commercial codes when any changes in the source code are 
required.   



     The third group is represented by research codes, which are typically limited to a 
special type of flow and/or simple flow geometries. Such codes are many in number and 
can hardly be reviewed in this paper. A few relevant examples are the CoreFlow [11], 
which can be applied to inertialess flows, research codes based on the asymptotic 
technique [12] and the TRANSMAG code for analysis of MHD induced corrosion of 
ferritic steels in the flowing lead-lithium alloy [13]. Many other examples can be found 
elsewhere.  A special group of research codes that address MHD turbulent flows includes 
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) (e.g., [14]) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) (e.g. 
[15]).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 2. Hartmann - Reynolds number diagram can be used to predict flow regimes in liquid-
breeder blankets, including HCLL (ITER TBM), DCLL (ITER TBM and DEMO), Li/V self-
cooled, PbLi self-cooled and molten salt self-cooled blankets. In the lower, middle and upper 
areas on the diagram, blanket flows are seen to be laminar, Q2D turbulent and 3D turbulent, 
correspondingly. 

5. Selected benchmark problems 
    
     For decades MHD studies of blanket flows were mostly focused on prediction of the 
MHD pressure drop in typical blanket configurations. Among common concerns of LM 
blankets, reduction of MHD pressure drop still remains one of the most important issues, 
stimulating new ideas and efforts on decoupling the electrically conducting wall from the 
fluid. However, there are many important phenomena beyond the MHD pressure drop 



that have not been fully addressed yet. That is why current studies are focusing more on 
the detailed structure of MHD flows, including various 3D and unsteady effects 
associated with buoyancy-driven convection, flow instabilities, and MHD turbulence 
[16]. These complex MHD processes can affect transport properties of MHD flows in a 
drastic way and have a profound impact on blanket performance. In fact, in almost all 
LM blankets, the flows are envisaged to demonstrate instabilities and eventually 
turbulence. In high Hartmann, high Reynolds number MHD flows, the latter takes a 
special form of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) turbulence [17] as illustrated in Fig. 2 for a 
relatively simple fully developed flow in a non-conducting square duct in a transverse 
magnetic field. Therefore, the selected benchmarks should address a wide spectrum of 
MHD flows from laminar to turbulent and Q2D turbulent flows. To span this variety of 
flows, we recommend here five benchmark problems (A-E): two for laminar flows, two 
for turbulent/Q2D flows and one for MHD flows with heat transfer. These five 
benchmark problems are described below. 
  
Benchmark problem A.  Fully developed laminar steady MHD flow 
 
     The recommended benchmark for fully developed flows is a classic 2D MHD problem 
for a flow of electrically conducting fluid in a rectangular duct subject to a uniform 
transverse magnetic field. This problem comes back to studies by Shercliff [18] for a 
non-conducting duct and by Hunt [19] for a duct with electrically conducting walls. In 
both cases the flow forms two Hartmann layers at the walls perpendicular to the magnetic 
field with the thickness scaling as 1/Ha, two side (Shercliff) layers at the walls parallel to 
the magnetic field scaling as 1/Ha0.5, and the core region where the velocity is almost 
uniform. If the duct walls are electrically conducting, the flow forms high-velocity jets 
near the side walls also scaling in width as 1/Ha0.5 (“M-shaped” velocity profile). Two 
benchmark cases can be recommended: (A1) all four walls are non-conducting, and (A2) 
two walls perpendicular to the magnetic field are conducting and two other walls are non-
conducting.

for the flow rate is , where -dP/dx is the pressure gradient in 
the liquid. The cross sectional coordinates z (along the magnetic field) and y (across the 
magnetic field) are scaled by b and by a (half of the duct size in the direction

computations were already done using a research code [20] on a stretched mesh of the 
size 99x99, which provides clustering mesh points near the walls for proper resolution of 
the Hartmann and side layers. In these computations, the convergence criterion was

computations are in very good agreement with the analytical solution.  
 
Benchmark problem B.  3D laminar steady MHD flow 
 
     Here, we recommend two benchmark cases for laminar steady MHD flows in a non-
uniform (fringing) transverse magnetic field at the exit from a magnet:  (B1) flow in a 
conducting pipe (Fig. 3) and (B2) flow in a conducting square duct (Fig. 4) [21, 22]. In 
this problem, the liquid motion within a non-uniform magnetic field results in 3D induced 
currents, which in turn cause an extra 3D MHD pressure drop and change the velocity 
profile.

The pressure drop data have been accurately documented and can be used for code 
benchmarking. The dimensionless flow parameters matching those in the experimental 



studies in the aforementioned references for eutectic sodium potassium alloy (NaK) flows 
in a magnetic field up to 2.1 T are summarized in Table II. Dimensional data can be 
found in [21, 22].

Benchmark problem C.  Q2D turbulent MHD flow 
 
     The suggested benchmark problem for this class of MHD flows has been adopted 
from the experimental study [23] where Q2D turbulent NaK flows in a thin-wall 
conducting rectangular duct (Fig. 5) were observed for Hartmann numbers from 600 to 
4800 and for Reynolds numbers from 3.3x103 to 1.0x105. The instabilities and associated 
turbulence transitions in these flows are related to formation of the M-shaped base 
velocity profile with two inflection points.

C2 (Type II) 2 1200 1x105 0.0714 0.0119 
 
Two Q2D turbulence regimes have been identified in this study. Using the original 
terminology [23], Type I instability occurs in the outer, bulk-side shear layer of the 
sidewall jet, while in Type II instability turbulent vortices are generated in the inner shear 
layer. More recent studies of instabilities and turbulence transitions in Q2D flows with a 



side-wall jet [24] suggest new interpretation of the observed instability types. Namely, 
Type I instability can be interpreted as a primary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the bulk 
flow associated with the inflection point in the velocity profile, while Type II instability 
seems to be related to destabilization of the side boundary layer by the bulk vortices. 
In accordance with the observed two turbulent flow regimes, two benchmark cases C1 
(Type I instability) and C2 (Type II instability) are summarized in Table III.

     To our best knowledge, there have been no successful efforts to reproduce 
experimental results in [23] in computations up to now. Taking into account the 
significant computational challenge, any computations that can reproduce the 
abovementioned flow regimes should be considered as successful. A significant amount 
of statistical data, which can be used for benchmarking the codes can be found in [23], 
including Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, and the time averaged velocity 
profile and pressure drop coefficient. The Reynolds stresses for the benchmark cases C1 
and C2 are shown in Fig. 6.   
 
Benchmark problem D.  MHD turbulent flow 
 
     Two computational techniques presently used for 3D MHD turbulent flows are DNS 
(Direct Numerical Simulation) and LES (Large Eddy Simulation). Both approaches are 
suggested for participation in the benchmarking study. It is also suggested that the 
analysis is limited to the most thoroughly studied configuration, namely the flow in a 
duct of rectangular cross-section with electrically insulating walls. This flow, while 
simple, combines the essential features of the transformation in response to the magnetic 
field: modification of mean velocity, suppression of fluctuations, and development of 
Hartmann and Shercliff boundary layers. Two archetypal cases can be considered: (D1) 
that of a uniform transverse (parallel to a set of walls) magnetic field imposed on a long 
section of the duct and (D2) that of a ‘magnetic obstacle’, which is an area of localized 
transverse magnetic field created by short pole-pieces of a permanent magnet. 
     In both cases, it would be interesting, in addition to the variables computed directly 
for the benchmarking, to consider visualizations of instantaneous and time-averaged 
velocity fields. 
 
(D1) Uniform magnetic field 
 
     In this case, the accuracy of simulations is largely determined by the ability of the 
numerical model to correctly describe the anisotropic suppression of turbulent 
fluctuations and transformation of the mean flow (see, e.g. [14,15,25]). One should also 
consider transitional laminar-turbulent flows, which are of special interest. It should be 
assured that the model correctly reproduces the peculiar flow features at R=Re/Ha 
between approximately 200 and 500, such as localization of turbulence in sidewall layers 
[14,15] and formation of isolated turbulent spots [26].

     The experiment [27] is suggested as a benchmark. In this experiment, flow in a duct of 
aspect ratio 5.82 is subject to a uniform magnetic field on the length of 21 hydraulic 
diameters. The magnetic field is parallel to the shorter walls. A computational model can 
assume a fully developed state and use the standard formulation with relatively short 
computational domain, periodic inlet-exit conditions, and the uniform one-component 
magnetic field applied in the entire domain. The suggested parameters of the simulations 
are listed in Table IV.

magnetic obstacle [28]).  
 
D2. Magnetic obstacle 
 
     Here, the main features of the flow are the suppression of turbulence upon entering the 
magnetic field, formation of large-scale vortices under the influence of the magnet, and 
development of long turbulent jets near the walls parallel to the magnetic field. A good 
computational model should be able to accurately reproduce all of them. It is possible 
that a combination of turbulent and nearly laminar zones makes this problem particularly 
challenging for LES. For the benchmarking, the results of the experiment [28] conducted 
at Re=4000, Ha=400 and duct aspect ratio 5 can be used. The magnetic field is localized 
with the main component parallel to the shorter walls. The non-dimensional parameters 
are based on the maximum magnetic field, shorter wall size, and mean flow velocity as 
the typical scales. Ref. [28] provides measurements of profiles of mean velocity U and 
intensity of streamwise velocity fluctuations at two locations downstream of the magnet 
(see Fig. 8 of [28]) that can be used for verification and validation purposes.  
 
 
 



Benchmark problem E.  MHD flow with heat transfer 
 
     The suggested benchmark problem is based on experimental studies [29] of MHD 
buoyancy-driven convection for a mercury flow in a differentially heated vertical 
enclosure of a square cross-section [40 x 40 x 300 (mm)]. The applied transverse 
magnetic field in the experiment is perpendicular to the temperature gradient (Fig. 8). 
The natural convection occurs due to the imposed temperature difference between two 
vertical walls. These two walls (hot and cold) are 1-cm thick copper plates kept at 
constant temperatures Th and Tc by strong water flows. All other walls are made of 
Plexiglas, i.e., electrically and thermally insulating. The copper plates are coated with 
epoxy in order to insulate them electrically from mercury.

experimental setup in [29] for MHD natural-convection flows: (a) vertical enclosure, (b) cross-
sectional area.   

 
     Relevant dimensionless parameters are the Hartmann number and the Grashof number, 
which are constructed in [29] using the entire cross-sectional duct dimension 2b. For this 
benchmark problem, the main goal is to reproduce in computations the experimental 
Nusselt number (Nu) versus Ha as shown in Fig. 9. Suggested parameters for 
computations are 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 for the Hartmann number and 
3x107 and 1.5x108 for the Grashof number.  The Nusselt number is defined as

In this formula, the numerator is the total heat applied to the hot wall (or extracted from 
the cold wall) and the denominator represents conduction heat transfer between the hot 
and cold walls. As seen from Fig.9, the Nusselt number demonstrates a peak at Ha~200-
300.

convection flow studied in [29]. 

 
 
 
The 3D computations, also presented in [29], predict the location of the peak at Ha~200 
but the computed Nusselt numbers are higher. The differences can be related to both the 
experiment and the computations. As alternative benchmarks, one can consider 
experiments on MHD natural-convection flows in [30] and [31].   
 
Other code testing 
 
     The benchmark problems recommended above are limited to Hartmann numbers not 
higher than a few thousands, i.e., considerably lower than those in fusion applications. 
This limitation is due to the fact that typical laboratory magnets have maximum magnetic 
fields of less than 2 T. Of all selected benchmark problems, only problem A, for which 
comparisons are made against an analytical solution, proposes high Hartmann numbers 
up to 15,000. Therefore, upon successful accomplishment of the proposed benchmark 
cases, the code developers/users can further be motivated to perform more code testing at 
higher flow parameters. Unfortunately, for very high Ha, Re and Gr experimental data 
are not available, so that code-to-code comparisons remain the only possible approach to 



address the validity of computations. Such efforts on extending the code capabilities 
towards the realistic fusion range are highly encouraged but are not considered as a part 
of the present approach to verification and validation of MHD codes for fusion 
applications. 
     In fact, all above recommended benchmarks are based on simple flow geometries, i.e., 
a straight rectangular duct or a pipe of constant cross-section.  In any typical blanket 
module, the geometry is more complex, involving contractions, subtractions, bends, 
manifolds, etc. The duct flows in a blanket are often coupled electromagnetically giving 
rise to higher MHD pressure drop (Madarame effect). It is useful to have benchmark 
problems of this type too. As possible candidates for benchmarks of this type one can 
consider experiments on laminar MHD flows in a Mock-Up of HCLL blanket [32] or 
experimental studies of MHD flows in a sudden expansion [33]. However, taking into 
account a significant number of already proposed benchmarks, we recommend these two 
problems to be considered as a next step providing that problems A- D are accomplished.     
      
 

6. Recommendations on how to organize V&V  
 
     Our recommendations are based mostly on experience, which can be gained from the 
already mentioned benchmark activities for CFD codes described in [1]. Taking into 
account complexity, uniqueness and computational challenges of proposed benchmark 
problems for CMHD, all participants will be given sufficient time, a year, to accomplish 
their computations. The benchmarks can be performed in any order or even in parallel but 
it appears to be more effective to start with the simplest, best understood problem for 
fully developed flows and then to proceed with others as ordered in Section 5, assuming 
that each problem will take on average two months. Once a particular benchmark is 
completed, the obtained results can be discussed among the participants before moving to 
the next one. After completing all the cases, the participants will be given another two 
months to prepare a report summarizing their findings that should include at least 
comparisons with an analytical solution (problem A), with experimental data (problems B, 
C, D and E), with numerical data (problem E), and also code-to-code comparisons (all 
problems). The graphical data in Figs. 3, 4, 6 and 9, which should be used for code 
benchmarking, have been digitized and the data files are available upon request from the 
first author.  Finally, the reports will be compiled in paper/papers to summarize the most 
important results and conclusions.  
     When doing computations, the performers are not supposed to use the same 
computational settings and should be flexible in their decisions about computational 
parameters, meshes, boundary conditions and closing relations (if there is more than one 
choice). For example, computations for the case of a developing MHD flow in a fringing 
magnetic field (Problem B) can be done using only one, transverse, component of the 
applied magnetic field or an entire magnetic field reconstructed from the transverse 
component such that the magnetic field satisfies the divergence- and curl-free 
requirements. A reconstruction procedure has been discussed for instance in [34]. 
Another example is LES of turbulent flows (Problem D), where several decisions could 
be made about the subgrid-scale model, e.g., Smagorinsky versus dynamic model. Also, 
in the case of electrically conducting ducts, it needs to be decided if the thin-wall 



boundary condition is sufficient or the alternative approach of solving the 
electromagnetic equations within the conducting wall is required. While making such 
decisions, the participants are responsible for all necessary tests to make sure that their 
computations adequately address a problem. This also includes mesh sensitivity and 
convergence analysis and other code testing that may require other benchmarks in 
addition to those proposed in this paper. All such details about computational settings and 
extra testing are certainly of a significant interest to all participants and have to be 
included in the reports. The CPU time, memory usage and the ability of a code to use 
effectively the computational resources, i.e. scalability and parallelization, is important 
information that should also be reported for each simulation. The principal goal of the 
proposed testing is, however, not to minimize the CPU time  or/and memory usage but to 
demonstrate the code ability to reproduce accurately experimental or trusted numerical 
data.
