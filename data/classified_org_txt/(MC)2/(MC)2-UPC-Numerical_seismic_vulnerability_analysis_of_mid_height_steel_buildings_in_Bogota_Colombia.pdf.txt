SUMMARY: 

A number of mid-height steel buildings have been erected recently in Bogotá. Their seismic 

risk might be high, given the present microzonation of Bogotá and the lack of comprehensive 

previous studies; noticeably, the response reduction factors were commonly obtained only 

from general recommendations. The objective of this work is to investigate the seismic 

performance of these buildings. This study is carried out on eighteen representative prototype 

buildings. All these edifices have plan symmetry and are uniform along their height. The 

eighteen considered prototype buildings are generated by combining the values of three 

parameters: span-length (6 and 8 m), number of floors (5, 10 and 15) and earthquake-resistant 

systems (moment-resistant frames, concentrically-braced frames and eccentrically-braced 

frames -using chevron braces-). The structures of each of these eighteen prototype buildings 

have been designed according to the former and to the current Colombian seismic design 

codes; in the former code two seismic zones are considered and in the current code such zones 

are coarsely subdivided in three and in five zones, respectively. The structural properties of 

the buildings designed with the former and the current Colombian codes are compared to 

investigate the practical repercussions of the new regulation. The vulnerability of these 

buildings has been evaluated by 2-D “push-over” analyses. The main objective of these 

analyses is to determine the response reduction factor; the obtained values are compared with 

the recommendations of the current Colombian seismic design code. As well, the seismic 

performance of the three considered earthquake-resistant systems are compared.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Steel construction provides two major earthquake-resistant qualities: lightweight and 

ductility; conversely, steel structures exhibit a rather low inherent damping. Globally 

speaking, the earthquake-resistant design of steel buildings tries to take profit of both 

advantages while attempting to compensate this drawback. Three major earthquake-resistant 

solutions have been proposed: MRF (moment-resistant frames), CBF (concentrically-braced 

frames) and EBF (eccentrically-braced frames). Other less frequent solutions have been also 

considered; among them: dual systems, special truss moment frames, outrigger walls, base 

isolation and energy dissipators. The concentrically braced frames are laterally stiffened by 

bracing members; “concentrically” means that, in the connections between beams, columns 

and braces, all the axes of the members are intersected in a single point. Conversely, in the 

eccentrically braced frames such axes do not intersect in a single point. The purpose of this 

strategy is to force the formation of hinges in the sections of the members where the braces 

fall on; the segments comprised between such hinges constitute the dissipative parts of the 

structure and are commonly termed as “links”. In both the concentric and eccentric bracing 

systems, two major types of bracing members have been proposed: diagonal (X-shaped) and 

chevron (V-shaped or inverted V-shaped); globally speaking, diagonal braces are slightly 

more efficient while chevron braces are commonly preferred because of the higher 

availability of space for openings. 

 

A number of mid-height steel buildings have been erected in the last years in Colombia, 



3 
 

principally in Bogotá; they are mostly intended for dwelling, administrative and commercial 

use. These constructions have been designed according to the former Colombian seismic code 

[1], which was basically inspired by the American regulations, mainly those by FEMA, ATC, 

ASCE and AISC. The seismic risk of these buildings might be high, given that a new 

microzonation of Bogotá has been recently released [2] and that no comprehensive theoretical 

studies about their vulnerability have been carried out; in particular, the values of the response 

reduction factor (R) are commonly obtained only from general recommendations that do not 

account for the individual characteristics of each building. The objective of this work is to 

investigate the seismic performance of these buildings in order to provide more accurate 

estimates of the response reduction factor and to be able to formulate design criteria; these 

recommendations might be incorporated to the Colombian seismic design code. As well, 

retrofit strategies will be proposed in further studies. 

 

This study is carried out on eighteen prototype buildings [3] that have been selected to 

represent the vast majority of the existing ones. All these types of prototype buildings have 

plan symmetry and are uniform along their height; in half of them the span-length is 6 m in 

both directions (this corresponds mainly to housing use), while in the others it is 8 m (mainly 

for commercial and administrative use). Three earthquake-resistant systems have been 

considered: moment-resistant frames (MRF), concentrically-braced frames (CBF) and 

eccentrically-braced frames (EBF); in these last two cases, chevron braces are contemplated. 

The numbers of floors are 5, 10 and 15. The structure of each of the eighteen prototype 

buildings is designed for a given seismic zone in Bogotá. According to the former 

microzonation [4] two zones are considered and the structure is designed for the previous 

Colombian regulation [1]; according to the newer microzonation [2] eight zones are 

considered and the structure is designed for the current Colombian regulation [5].

The seismic vulnerability of these buildings has been evaluated, in the framework of the 

Performance-Based Design [6], by static nonlinear analyses (push-over). The structural 

behavior of the buildings is described by finite element models with frame elements; the 

cooperation of the top concrete layer of the slabs is neglected. In the moment-resistant frames 

and in the eccentrically-braced frames the nonlinearities are concentrated in the plastic hinges 

located near the connections. In the concentrically-braced frames, prior to the buckling of the 

compressed braces the nonlinearities are concentrated there; afterwards, there also plastic 

hinges near the connections. In the push-over analyses, two vertical distributions of the 

pushing horizontal forces are considered: uniform pattern and modal pattern (e.g. shaped as 

the first mode of vibration) [7]. The target drifts (performance points) are determined, for 

each performance objective (IO, LS and CP) according to the recommendations of the ATC-

40 [8]. 

 

The results of the push-over analyses provide estimates of the response reduction factor; it is 

concluded that, in some cases, the values recommended by the design code are 

unconservative. As well, some of the buildings exhibit inadequate behavior for several 

performance objectives. 

 

2. SEISMIC MICROZONATIONS OF BOGOTÁ 

This section describes the former and the current seismic microzonations that have been 

proposed for Bogotá. 

 

Figure 1 shows the former microzonation of Bogotá [4]. In Figure 1 “Cerros” corresponds to 

rock and stiff soil, “Piedemonte” refers to good quality colluvial soil and alluvial fans, and 



5 
 

“Lacustre A” and “Lacustre B” correspond to soft clay deposits whose depth is higher and 

smaller than 50 m, respectively. “Terrazas y Conos” are terraces and alluvial fans, “Rondas de 

río y humedales” are river banks and swamps and “Rellenos de Basuras” and “Rellenos de 

Excavación” are rubbish and dig dumps, respectively. In this study only zones “Piedemonte” 

and “Lacustre A” have been considered. The other seismic zones indicated in Figure 1 are not 

considered since they contain only small numbers of steel buildings. Figure 2 displays the 

design spectra of these two zones.

Figure 2. Design spectra according to the former seismic microzonation of Bogotá [4] 
 
Figure 3 displays the abovementioned current seismic microzonation of Bogotá [2]. In Figure 

3 “Cerros” corresponds to rock and stiff soil with top soft layers not exceeding 6 m (vs,30 > 

750 m / s, where vs,30 accounts for the shear wave velocity in the top 30 m), “Piedemonte” 

refers to soft alluvial and colluvial soil (200 m / s < vs,30 < 750 m / s) and “Lacustre” 

corresponds to very soft clay deposits (vs,30 < 175 m / s). As well “Aluvial” refers to mid-

quality alluvial deposits (175 m / s < vs,30 < 300 m / s) and “Lacustre-Aluvial” shows 

intermediate characteristics in between “Aluvial” and “Lacustre”. Finally “Depósito ladera” 

are unstable high slope soils, with relevant risk of land-sliding; the construction is restricted. 

In the categories “Lacustre”, “Aluvial” and “Lacustre-Aluvial”, the numbers indicate the 

depth (in m) of the soft deposit layers. In the category “Piedemonte”, subcategories A, B and 

C do not differ deeply. In this study only zones “Piedemonte A, B and C” and “Lacustre 50, 

100, 200, 300 and 500” have been considered. The other seismic zones indicated in Figure 3 

are not considered since they contain only small numbers of steel buildings.

Comparison between the two microzonations depicted in Figure 1 and in Figure 3 shows that 

the main difference is that the newer microzonation consists basically in a refinement of the 

previous one. In the former microzonation (Figure 1) zones “Piedemonte” and “Lacustre A” 

have been considered; in the current microzonation (Figure 3) such zones are split in 

“Piedemonte A, B and C” and in “Lacustre 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500”, respectively. Figure 4 

displays the design spectra of these eight zones.

Comparison between Figure 2 and Figure 4 shows that in the former microzonation (Figure 2) 

the length of the plateau for soil “Lacustre A” is excessive; thus generating an over-

conservative spectrum. 

 
3. CONSIDERED BUILDINGS 

 
Eighteen prototype buildings are selected to represent the vast majority of the mid-height steel 

edifices in Bogotá. All these buildings have plan symmetry and are uniform along their 

height; all the columns are continuous down to foundation and the influence of the basements 

is neglected. The main carrying-load system is composed of steel columns and of steel decks 

topped with a concrete layer. The plan floor of the buildings is square, with four equal-length 

bays in each direction; there are 5  5 = 25 columns, which are laid according to an 

orthogonal regular pattern. The prototype buildings are distinguished by the span-length in 

both directions, by the number of floors and by the type of earthquake-resistant system (alike 

in both directions). Two span-lengths and three numbers of floors are considered: 6  8 m and

resistant frames (MRF), concentrically-braced frames (CBF) and eccentrically-braced frames 

(EBF); in these last two cases, chevron braces are contemplated. The cooperation of the infill 

walls (cladding and partitioning) is neglected since, according to the common construction 

practices in Colombia, they are habitually separated from the main structure. Figure 5 shows 

overall views of the structures of the selected prototype buildings. The structures depicted in 

Figure 5 correspond to MRF; CBF and EBF are similar, yet incorporating the chevron braces.

Figure 5. Selected representative prototype buildings 

 
As discussed previously, the structure of each of the eighteen prototypes buildings is designed 

for ten seismic zones in Bogotá; two of them (Figure 1, “Piedemonte” and “Lacustre A”) 

correspond to the former microzonation and eight correspond to the current microzonation 

(Figure 3, “Piedemonte A, B and C” and “Lacustre 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500”). Therefore, 

the number of analyzed structures is 18  10 = 180. 

 

To obtain representative results, the buildings in the two zones of the former microzonation 

have been designed according to the previous Colombian regulations [1]; conversely, the 



10 
 

buildings in the eight zones of the current microzonation have been designed according to the 

current Colombian regulations [5]. The importance is “normal” (given their dwelling, 

administrative and commercial use). The seismic design is based in the simplified method 

stated in the codes; among other common simplifications, it implies assuming the same 

fundamental period in both directions (estimated from empirical expressions). In Bogotá the 

design acceleration is Aa = 0.15 g. The dead load has been assumed as 2.5 kN / m2 (slab self-

weight) + 1.5 kN / m2 (partitioning walls) + 1 kN / m2 (facilities) + 1.5 kN / m2 (cladding 

system, distributed along the whole surface of the façade). Live load is L = 2 kN / m2; 

according to the Colombian code, 50% of this load is considered to act simultaneously with 

the seismic action. The design input spectra are obtained from the former and current 

microzonations, Figure 2 and Figure 4, respectively. In spite that the buildings are symmetric, 

5% accidental eccentricities established by the [1] and the [5] are considered. The damping 

factor has been assumed equal to 5%. The Colombian code states a design inter-story drift 

equal to 1%; this condition is the most restrictive in most of the MRF buildings, being 

comparatively less restrictive in the CBF and EBF. The seismic design has consisted of 

determining equivalent static forces in both directions and applying them to 3D models of the 

structures of the buildings. As suggested by both Colombian regulations, only compact 

sections are selected for columns and beams [9]. 

 

The columns are made of A-572 steel (fy = 342 MPa) [10] while the beams and joists are 

made of A-36 steel (fy = 248 MPa) [11]; this difference attempts getting earlier failures in the 

beams than in the columns. The compressive strength of the topping concrete is f c’ = 21 MPa; 

the depth of the steel deck is 50 + 70 mm (120 mm concrete depth) and its thickness is 0.75 

mm. Figure 6 shows plan views of typical floor slabs of the selected buildings; Figure 6.a and 

Figure 6.b correspond to buildings with span-length equal to 6 m and to 8 m, respectively. 



11 
 

Figure 6 shows that each building contains two seismic-resistant frames in the y direction (A 

and E frames) while in the x direction there are four seismic-resistant frames (inside 1, 2, 4 

and 5 frames). As discussed previously, each of these resistant parts can be either a moment-

resisting frame (MRF), a concentrically braced frame (CBF) or an eccentrically braced frame 

(EBF).

Figure 6. Floor slab layout 
 
In the 6  6 buildings the height of the first floor is 4 m and the one of the upper floors is 3 m; 

in the 8  8 buildings those heights are 4.50 m and 3.50 m, respectively. As shown by Figure 

6, the separation in between the joists is 1.50 m (L / 4) for the 6  6 buildings and 1.60 m (L / 

5) for the 8  8 buildings. The columns, beams and joists are made of W sections and the braces 

are made with square hollow sections (HSS) [9]. The joists are W1015 and W1219 for the 

6  6 and 8  8 buildings, respectively. In the EBF buildings, the eccentricity between the 

chevron braces is selected for generating flexural-shear yielding failure in the link [12, 13]. 

Figure 7 shows overall elevation views of the selected 5-story buildings; the configurations of 

only some of the frames can be qualified as “seismic frames” (e.g. those designed to contribute 

to the lateral resistance); Figure 6 shows that, in the x direction, there are four two-bay seismic 

frames (inner and outer frames, see Figure 7.a, Figure 7.c and Figure 7.e) and, in the y direction, 



12 
 

there are two four-bay seismic frames (outer frames, see Figure 7.b, Figure 7.d and Figure 7.f). 

In the seismic frames, the beam-column connections are pre-qualified according to [14]; the 

chosen type is “Welded Unreinforced Flange – Bolted Web” (WUF-B), commonly known as 

“California post-Northridge” connection. In the non-seismic frames, the beam-column 

connections are hinged. In the CBF and in the EBF the connections among the braces and the 

other members are hinged; as well as the connections among beams and columns. In the seismic 

frames, the columns are clamped to the foundation; otherwise, they are hinged. Shear studs 

connecting the steel deck with the supporting horizontal members are placed only in the non-

seismic elements, e.g. the joists (y direction) and those beams that do not belong to the seismic 

frames (x and y directions) [15, 16]. This solution is customary in Bogotá and is basically 

intended for guaranteeing the diaphragm effect of the slabs (under lateral loading) rather than 

for increasing the bending stiffness and strength of beams and joists (under gravity loads).

Figure 7. Elevation views of the 5-story buildings 
 
Table 1 displays the main structural features of each of the eighteen selected buildings. In the 

notation “5 – 6  6 – MRF”, “5” accounts for the number of stories, “6  6” refers to the span-

length in both directions (in m) and “MRF” means Moment-Resisting Frame; analogously 

“CBF” and “EBF” relate to Concentric-Braced Frames and to Eccentric-Braced Frames, 



14 
 

respectively. Given that the structural parameters depend on the soil conditions, the properties 

in Table 1 correspond to the most demanding terrain “Piedemonte-B”, as indicated in Figure 

3. The steel profiles [9] belong to the seismic parts of the structure (highlighted members in 

Figure 6 and in Figure 7). The members of the structure have been designed according to the 

Colombian code [5] as “Moderate Energy Dissipation Capacity” for MRF and EBF and as 

“Special Energy Dissipation Capacity” for CBF; the recommendations in [12] and in [17] 

have been considered for EBF and CBF, respectively. In Table 1 there are two profiles per 

case, e.g. for building 5 – 6  6 – MRF the first floor columns are W14233 / W14257; the 

first / second profiles correspond to x and y directions, respectively. Noticeably, in the CBF 

the beams should be designed to resist the unbalanced axial forces transmitted by the braces 

after the buckling of the compressed brace [5, 17]; Table 1 shows that the beams of the CBF 

are significantly stiffer than those of EBF and even of CBF. In the EBF the braces are 

designed not to buckle prior to the formation of plastic hinges in the link [12].

Table 2 displays the main seismic design parameters for the representative prototype 

buildings, for the “Piedemonte B” zone (NSR-10, newer microzonation). The weights 

correspond to the dead load. The fundamental periods T0 have been determined from the 

empirical expressions suggested by the [5]. The fundamental periods in both directions (T0x 

and T0y) have been also obtained from linear elastic modal analyses by using the same 

structural modeling than in the push-over analyses (section 4); since the modal analyses are 

linear, the obtained fundamental periods refer to initial (undamaged) conditions. The 

comparison among the values of T0 and T0x and T0y shows no major differences among them. 

The fundamental periods TF listed in Table 2 show that the initial stiffness in both directions 

is similar; comparison among the MRF, CBF and EBF cases shows that the stiffening 

generated by the braces is important, mostly in the concentrically-braced buildings. As well, 

the buildings spanning 6 m are significantly stiffer than those spanning 8 m. The response 

reduction factor (R) is obtained as indicated in the [5]. Last two columns in Table 2 show the 

dimensionless spectral ordinates Sa / Aa where Aa = 0.15 g, as discussed previously. Figure 4 

shows that the constant-acceleration branch of the design spectrum ranges in between T = 0 

and TC = 0.56 s; therefore, only buildings 5 – 6  6 – CBF, 5 – 8  8 – CBF and 5 – 6  6 – 

EBF lay inside the plateau. The amplification factors accounting for the current microzonation 

are Fa = 1.95 and Fv = 1.70 [2, 5]. The important values of Sa / Aa in the last two columns in 

Table 2 show that the input acceleration in the bedrock is significantly amplified in the top of 

the buildings; in the 5-story buildings this effect is contributed both by the soft soil and by the 

rather stiff building.

Table 3 displays the equivalent modal masses (mi*) expressed in terms of the total mass of the 

building (m). Figures from Table 3 provide the following conclusions regarding the relative 

importance of the first modes: (i) there are no relevant differences between the x and y 

directions and between the 6  6 and 8  8 buildings and (ii) except for CBF, the first modal 

masses of the lower modes are higher for shorter buildings. Results from Table 3 show that in 

practically all the cases the modal masses of the first mode are higher than 75% of the mass of 

the building; in this case, the FEMA 356 Prestandard and the ASCE-41 [18, 19] indicate that, 

in the push-over analyses, the variation of the horizontal pushing forces along the height of 

the building is proportional to the coefficient given by equation 3-12 of that code. Such 

coefficient is proportional to the mass of each floor and to the height from the base of the 

building.

Table 4 displays the structural steel weight of the eighteen prototype buildings whose 

structure has been designed for the aforementioned ten seismic zones (Figure 2 and Figure 4). 

This weight comprises the main structural steel members: columns, beams, braces, base and 

gusset plates, stiffener plates, bolts and welds. Broadly speaking, the overall cost of the 

structure is proportional to that weight; however, the unit cost of the braced frames might be 

slightly higher than the one of the MRF due to the influence of the detailing of the 

connections. Figures from Table 4 show that the eccentrically braced frames have 

significantly less lightweight than the moment resisting frames and that the concentrically 

braced frames.

4. NUMERICAL MODELLING OF THE STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOR 
 

For the push-over analyses, the structural behavior of the selected buildings (section 3) is 

described with 2-D finite element models with frame elements [20]. Each push-over analysis 

is carried out in a single frame; the cooperation of the non-seismic frames is neglected, hence, 

as shown by Figure 6, there are four seismic frames in x direction and 2 in y direction. In the x 

direction, the outer and inner frames are considered alike, despite the minor differences 

among them, mainly the supported load. Given the absence of shear studs in the seismic 

frames (see section 3), the cooperation of the top concrete layer is neglected. 

 

 MRF buildings. In the MRF buildings the behavior of beams and columns is considered 

basically linear while the nonlinearities are concentrated in plastic hinges located near the 

beam-column connections.  

 CBF buildings. In the CBF buildings [21, 22] the first failure arises when the compressed 

braces reach their critical buckling forces, accounting for the initial imperfections; once 

these braces buckle they are disengaged from the main frame, without any residual after-

buckling strength. The braces have been conservatively considered hinged in both 



20 
 

transverse directions. This brittle collapse model involves a simplification on the safe side. 

 EBF buildings. In the EBF buildings the behavior of beams and columns is considered 

basically linear while the nonlinearities are concentrated in plastic hinges located in the 

connections between the braces and the main beams. 

 

Figure 8 describes the aforementioned failure mechanisms for MRF, CBF and EBF.

Figure 8. Failure mechanisms for the considered building types 
 

The hysteretic behavior of the plastic hinges is described by multi-linear moment-curvature 

laws, as the one displayed by Figure 9. The moment-curvature laws are derived from the 

structural parameters of the steel and the geometrical parameters of the members and of the 

connections, by following the recommendations of  [18]. In Figure 9, Q accounts for any 

lateral force causing the moment in the joint and Qy is the yielding value of Q;  and  are 

deformation quantities (rotation angle and displacement, respectively). The lengths of the 

plastic hinges are determined according to [18]; in most of the cases, these lengths are close to 

half of the depth of the member.

Figure 9. Moment-rotation law of a plastic hinge [18] 
 
The model displayed in Figure 9 is also used to represent the axial failure of the braces of the 

CBF buildings. For tensioned braces, the values of parameters a, b and c are selected as 

indicated by [18] for “Braces in Tension”. For compressed braces, parameters a, b and c are 

selected as a = b = c = 0; this reflects a brittle buckling behavior. 

 

5. PUSH-OVER ANALYSES 

This section describes the results of the 2-D nonlinear static (push-over) analyses of the 

buildings described in section 3. As discussed previously, the variation of the lateral pushing 

forces along the height of the buildings is defined in two ways: uniform (corresponding to 

constant acceleration, e.g. approximately proportional to the mass of each floor) and modal 

(as the first modal shape) [7]. Only the contribution of the first mode is considered, since, in 

most of the analyzed situations, more than 75% of the total mass participates in the 

fundamental mode in the direction under consideration [18], see Table 3. To determine the 

target drifts, the demanding spectra are obtained from the former and current Colombian 

design codes [1, 5] and from the previous and the recently-issued microzonation for Bogotá 

[2, 4], Figure 2 and Figure 4, respectively [20]. For LS (Life Safety) such spectra are intended 

to correspond to 475 years return period, and for IO (Immediate Occupancy) and CP 

(Collapse Prevention) they correspond to 72 and 970 years, respectively [18]. The target drifts 

are determined, by intersecting the capacity curves and the demand spectra, as indicated in 



22 
 

ATC-40 [8]. Given the rather high lateral flexibility of these buildings, the soil-structure 

interaction is not accounted for. Second-order analyses are performed; however, in most of 

the cases the differences with the first-order analyses are small. 

 

Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 display the capacity curves of the buildings with, 

respectively, Moment-Resisting Frames, Concentric-Braced Frames and Eccentric-Braced 

Frames; the buildings have been designed for the most demanding “Piedemonte-B” Zone 

(newer microzonation, Figure 3). In Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 the vertical axis 

depicts the base shear coefficient, i.e. the base shear force normalized with the weight of the 

building, and the horizontal axis represents the drift angle, i.e. the relative displacement of the 

top floor in terms of percentage of the height of the building. In a given building, the capacity 

curves which correspond to the x and y directions (Figure 6 and Figure 7) and to uniform and 

modal pattern variations are plotted together. Point “” indicates the onset of the first plastic 

hinge, which is coincident with the end of the linear branch. Points “”, “” and 

“”correspond to Target Drifts IO, LS and CP, respectively; omitted points mean that the 

capacity curve does not intersect the demanding spectrum, i.e. there is collapse. The reference 

[20] contains similar curves for the buildings designed for the other seismic zones (Figure 1 

and Figure 3).

6. DISCUSSION 

The observation of Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 provides the following conclusions on 

the influence of the involved parameters: 

 

 Direction. The capacity curves for the x and y directions are rather similar both in the 

linear and nonlinear ranges; this resemblance refers to the vertical ordinates, the onset of 

yielding (points ) and the Target Drifts IO, LS and CP. This conclusion shows similar 



26 
 

levels of efficiency in the seismic designs in both directions.  

 Vertical distribution. Since the vertical ordinate is proportional to the base shear, the 

modal distribution can be deemed more demanding than the uniform one; this fact can be 

observed in all the cases. 

 Span-length. Comparison among the left and right pairs of curves (6  6 and 8  8, 

respectively) shows that the capacity curves and the performance points of the buildings 

with span-lengths 6 and 8 m are rather analogous. 

 Earthquake-resisting system. For all the analyzed buildings, the yielding and collapse 

displacements for MRF are higher than those of EBF; in their turn, such displacements are 

greater than those of CBF. Those differences can be explained by the inherent largest 

flexibility of MRF buildings compared to EBF and CBF ones; among EBF and CBF, the 

increase of ductility generated by the eccentricity of the braces implies larger yielding and 

collapse displacements. In terms of forces, the yielding and collapse forces for CBF are 

higher than those of MRF; in their turn, such forces are greater than those of EBF. Those 

differences can be explained by the inherent largest strength of CBF buildings compared 

to MRF ones; among MRF and EBF, the last have less force strength because of the high 

relevance of the shear-flexural behavior of the link. 

 Number of floors. The yielding and collapse displacements for the 5, 10 and 15-story 

buildings with equivalent earthquake-resisting systems are similar. The capacity curves 

show that the seismic strength in terms of base shear coefficient is only slightly influenced 

by the number of levels; the taller the buildings, the lowest the base shear coefficient.  

 

For each capacity curve, the damage intervals suggested by the research project RISK-UE 

[23] are adopted. “ND” (No Damage) corresponds to drift displacements lower than 0.7 y, 

“SD” (Slight Damage) corresponds to drift displacements between 0.7 y and y, “MD” 



27 
 

(Moderate Damage) corresponds to drift displacements between y and y + 0.25 (u  y), 

“ED” (Extensive Damage) corresponds to drift displacements between y + 0.25 (u  y) and 

u, and “HD” (Heavy Damage, that meaning collapse) corresponds to drift displacements 

higher than u. y and u are, respectively, the yielding and ultimate (collapse) displacements. 

For a proper seismic behavior, Target Drifts for IO, LS and CP should correspond, 

respectively, either to SD, MD and ED or to smaller damage intervals [24]. According to this 

criterion, Table 5 displays the adequacy of the levels of damage corresponding to each of the 

three considered Target Drifts. “YES” / “NO” indicate satisfactory / unsatisfactory 

performance and “-” means that the corresponding performance point does not exist because 

the capacity curve and the demand spectrum have no intersection; certainly, this can be 

understood as highly unsatisfactory performance.

Table 5 provides the following conclusions on the influence of the involved parameters: 

 

 Direction. The performances for the x and y directions are rather similar.  



28 
 

 Vertical distribution. The performances for the uniform and modal distributions are 

rather similar. 

 Span-length. The performances for 6  6 and 8  8 buildings are rather similar. 

 Earthquake-resisting system. Globally speaking, CBF buildings exhibit a more adequate 

behavior than the MRF ones while the performance of EBF buildings is unacceptable in 

most of the cases. The highly adequate performance of the CBF buildings can be 

explained by the over-conservative design of columns and beams [17]. 

 Number of floors. By and large, the tallest considered buildings demonstrate a seismic 

performance worse than the shorter ones. 

 

Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15 describe the damage progression for buildings 15 – 8 × 8 

– MRF, 5 – 8 × 8 – CBF and 5 – 8 × 8 – EBF, respectively. Such buildings are designed for 

the “Piedemonte B” zone (Table 1); the depicted combinations of hinges and of failures 

correspond to modal distribution of the pushing forces and to y direction (black dashed 

capacity curves in Figure 10.f, Figure 11.b and Figure 12.b). In Figure 13 and Figure 15, the 

meanings of symbols , ,  and  have been established as indicated in [18]:  corresponds to 

the onset of yielding (corner point B in Figure 9) and ,  and  correspond to acceptance 

criteria IO, LS and CP, respectively [18]. In Figure 14 a similar criterion is also considered for 

the tensioned braces while the compressed braces, because of their fragile behavior, have only 

the code ; noticeably, in the tensioned braces point  corresponds to the final segment of the 

yielding branch (near corner point C in Figure 9). The last sketches in Figure 13, Figure 14 

and Figure 15 correspond to the rightest (collapse) point in the black dashed curves in Figure 

10.f, Figure 11.b and Figure 12.b, respectively; the other sketches are basically uniformly 

distributed along the nonlinear segment of such curves. Results from Figure 13, Figure 14 and 

Figure 15 provide the following conclusions: 



29 
 

 

 Figure 13 shows that the collapse mechanism is extremely brittle since virtually all the 

damage is concentrated in the first floor columns, with little damage in the beams; this 

observation can be basically extended to the other MRFs [20] yet the shorter building are 

more ductile. Given that the MRF buildings were designed fulfilling the code 

requirements aiming to guarantee ductility, this conclusion highlights the difficulty of 

predicting the actual collapse mechanism from merely linear analyses. 

 Figure 14 shows that the CBF buildings perform satisfactorily since all of the damage is 

concentrated in the braces and, prior to collapse, involves a relevant number of them. 

Noticeably, after the buckling of the compressed braces and the yielding of the tensioned 

braces, the remaining structural members (e.g. columns and beams) are still capable to 

resist the pushing lateral forces [17]. These observations can be broadly extended to the 

other CBFs [20]. 

 Figure 15 shows that the EBF buildings perform satisfactorily since all of the damage is 

concentrated in the dissipative segments of the beams (link and adjoining parts). However, 

the collapse mechanism is extremely brittle since virtually all the damage is concentrated 

in the first floor. These observations can be broadly extended to the other EBFs [20].

Following the classic equal-displacement approach [6], the response reduction factor R is 

determined from the capacity curves [25-27] depicted in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12. 

Since Table 2 shows that the fundamental periods of the buildings are clearly out of the short 

period range [28], the correction for short periods is not deemed necessary. The influence of 

the hysteretic characteristics is indirectly taken into account in the design of the push-over 

approach; moreover, some studies [29] have pointed out the little influence of the hysteretic 

characteristics of the structure compared to other effects. R factor is determined as the ratio 

between the collapse and the yielding displacements; R =  Rd where  is the over-strength 

factor (the ratio between the actual and the design strength) and Rd is the ductility factor (the 

ratio between the elastic and the actual strength). The obtained values of R,  and Rd are 

displayed in Table 6. 

 

Figures in Table 6 show that the response reduction factors tend to decrease with the number 

of floors (Figure 13) and the values for the EBF are smaller than those for MRF and CBF; as 

well, R factors for CBF and MRF are similar (Figure 14 and Figure 15). On the other side, the 

values of R are little sensitive to the direction, to the vertical variation of the pushing forces 

and to the span-length.

 (*) First / second values correspond to modal and uniform distributions, respectively 
 
Comparison among the values in Table 6 and the assumed response reduction factors listed in 

Table 2 shows that, in virtually all the cases, the analyzed buildings do not possess the required 

ductility. 

 

The work [30] contains a numerical study for steel MRF designed according to the European 

regulations for high seismicity regions; overall comparison among the obtained values of the 

response reduction factor from that work and from Table 6 shows that both are relatively 

similar. As well, the aforementioned decrease of R with the increased number of floors is also 

confirmed.  

 

The Eurocode 8 [7] states that for MRF and EBF buildings with Ductility Class High (DCH) 

the behavior factor q (which is equivalent to the R factor) can be obtained as q = 5 u / 1, 

where factor 5 plays the role of the ductility factor Rd and u / 1 corresponds to the over-

strength factor . If none push-over analysis has been carried out, for MRF and EBF 



33 
 

buildings like those considered in this work, u / 1 = 1.3 and 1.2, respectively. If capacity 

curves are available, the arising value of u / 1 can be considered, with a top limit equal to 

1.6. For CBF with V-bracing (chevron braces) the Eurocode 8 states that q = 2.5. Comparison 

with Table 6 provides the following conclusions: 

 

 MRF. Rd factor is smaller than 5 in all the cases, the difference being higher for taller 

buildings. u / 1 () is smaller than 1.3 in a relevant number of cases; the top limit (1.6) 

is never reached. 

 CBF. The value of q (R) indicated by the Eurocode 8 is clearly exceeded in all the cases. 

As discussed previously, this satisfactory behavior can be explained by the late 

cooperation of columns and beams [17]. 

 EBF. Rd factor is clearly smaller than 5 in all the cases, the difference being even higher 

for taller buildings. u / 1 () is bigger than 1.2 in virtually all the cases; the top limit 

(1.6) is, by far, never reached. 

 

7. CONCLUSIONS 

This work presents a numerical vulnerability assessment of eighteen 5, 10 and 15-story steel 

buildings. These buildings are selected to represent the vast majority of similar buildings 

recently erected in Bogotá, Colombia. The span-lengths are 6 m and 8 m, and three lateral 

resistant systems are considered: moment resisting frames (MRF) and concentrically and 

eccentrically braced frames (CBF and EBF, respectively); only chevron braces are used. The 

vulnerability is estimated by static push-over analyses by assuming two patterns for the vertical 

variation of the pushing forces: uniform and modal. 

 

Main conclusions of this study: 



34 
 

 Seismic performance. CBF buildings exhibit an adequate behavior, the performance of 

EBF is unacceptable in most of the cases and the behavior of MRF buildings is 

intermediate. The highly adequate performance of the CBF buildings can be explained by 

the over-conservative design of columns and beams. By and large, the tallest considered 

buildings demonstrate a worse seismic performance. The performance of the considered 

prototype buildings is insensitive to the input direction, the vertical variation of the 

pushing forces and the span-length. 

 Collapse mechanism. The collapse mechanism for MRF buildings is extremely brittle. 

Since those buildings fulfill the ductility requirements, this shows the difficulty of 

predicting the collapse mechanism from merely linear analyses. In the CBF buildings all of 

the damage is concentrated in a relevant number of the braces; after the failure of the braces, 

columns and beams still hold capacity. In the EBF buildings the collapse mechanism is 

extremely brittle since the damage is concentrated in the link segments of the first floor 

beams.  

 Response reduction factor. The values of the R are little sensitive to the direction, to the 

vertical variation of the pushing forces and to the span-length. Two major trends are 

observed: R factor decreases with the number of floors and the values for the EBF are 

smaller than those for MRF and CBF. In virtually all the cases, the analyzed buildings do 

not possess the ductility which is required by the Colombian design code. 

 Eurocode 8. Comparison with the prescriptions of the shows that they are over-

conservative for MRF and EBF buildings but are under-conservative for CBF buildings.
