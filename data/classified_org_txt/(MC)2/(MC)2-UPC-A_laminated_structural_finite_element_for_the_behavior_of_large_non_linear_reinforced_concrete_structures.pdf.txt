Abstract

In order to correctly predict the kinematics of complex structures, analysis using three-dimensional finite elements
(3DFEs) seems to be the best alternative. However, simulation of large multi-layered structures with many plies can be
unaffordable with 3DFEs because of the excessive computational cost, especially for non-linear materials. In addition,
the discretization of very thin layers can lead to highly distorted FEs carrying numerical issues, therefore, reduced
models arise as an affordable solution.

This paper describes a new finite element formulation to perform numerical simulations of laminated reinforced
concrete structures. The intention of this work is that the proposed scheme can be applied in the analysis of real-life
structures where a high amount of computational resources are needed to fulfill the meshing requirements, hence the
resulting formulation has to be a compromise between simplicity and efficiency.

So that, the condensation of a dimension (thickness), mandatory to model three-dimensional structures with two-
dimensional finite elements (2DFEs), leads to refer all layers contained within such FEs to a plane, which is typically
named middle plane or geometrical plane, since its sole function is to serve as a geometrical reference. This work is
based on the assumption that the geometrical plane has to be distinguished from a mechanical plane, which is where
the resultant stiffness of all layers is contained. It is also assumed in this work that the mechanical plane changes its
position due to non-linear response of the component materials.

1. Introduction

Current theories that allow the use of two-dimensional FEs to model composite materials, yet powerful,
lack the necessary simplicity for their application in complex structures where a large amount of FE is
required for a good approximation in the obtained results.

Thus, simpler and more efficient techniques are required for modelling laminated structures, where the
three-dimensional description can be reduced to a two-dimensional model by introducing hypotheses on the

displacements and/or on the stresses field, since laminate thickness is at least one order of magnitude lower
than in-plane dimensions.

Reference [1] provides an overview of the available theories and finite elements that have been developed
for multi-layered, anisotropic, composite plate and shell structures. Multi-scale approaches [2, 3] can also
be used to model non-linear multi-layered materials. In this method a macroscopic model is used to obtain
the global response of the structure whereas the material behaviour, modelled with a constitutive law, is
solved with a microscopic model.

Many reduced approaches have been developed and improved since 19th century. In order to facilitate
their classification, they could be distinguished according to [4]:

a) The type of unknown variable chosen, so they could be Displacement Based Theories (DB), Stress-
Based Theories (SB), or if both stress and displacement are considered as unknowns, a Mixed Ap-
proach (MB) is obtained.

b) How the unknown variables are described. In this classification it may be an Equivalent Single Layer
(ESL) description, where governing equations are written for the whole plate, or a Layer-Wise (LW)
description, where each layer is treated independently assuming separate displacement/stress fields
within each ply, which leads to write the governing equations for each layer.

From the previous classification, the most basic DB-ESL model is the Classical Theory (CT) [5],
whereas an improvement to the CT theory is the First Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) [6] which
enhances the CT kinematics by adding shear effects. Although CT and FSDT are excellent alternatives to
accurately model homogeneous thin and thick structures, they lead to poor prediction in the cases listed
below

• Where component materials have a high level of transverse anisotropy.

• When applied to the analysis of composite laminated with embedded debounding.

• When it is necessary to provide regions with 3-D stresses fields, i.e. σZ , 0.

• When it is required to capture the so called zig-zag pattern of in-plane displacements (ZZ condition).

• When it is required to satisfy the condition of continuous transverse shear along the thickness direction
(TC condition).

The cause is found in the linear thickness distribution of the axial displacement, which does not match
the ZZ pattern depicted in figure 1 [4].



C. Escudero et al / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 00 (2016) 1–31 3

In order to fulfill the previously listed condition it must be necessary to use either a theory based on
3-D kinematics, or a LW based theory. Although LW theories accurately fulfill both, the ZZ and the TC
condition, the number of unknown variables is proportional to the number of analyzed layers. As a result,
these models yield not only a high level of accuracy but also to an amount of unknown variables similar to
the 3D analysis. For this reason, LW models may result unattractive for simulating large laminated structures
with many plies. Therefore, these models should be employed to analyze complex problems where other
less expensive approaches fail to give realistic predictions [4].

A special case of LW model where the number of unknowns is independent of the number of analyzed
layer is the Zigzag theory (ZZT), which is a good compromise between the accuracy of MB-LW theories and
the computational efficiency of DB-ESL models. One of the most important advantages of these theories is
that the number of kinematics unknowns are independent of the number of analyzed layers.

Have to be remarked that, the study of the cases where it is mandatory to use a LW description are out
of the scope of this work, and the only feasible solution from a computational point of view, which allows
to achieve good results, is to adopt a ESL scheme.

That is why it has been proposed a scheme capable of reproducing the bending damage of a laminated
material without the need of additional degrees of freedom than the ones listed below.

d =
{
w1 θx1 θy1 w2 θx2 θy2 w3 θx3 θy3

}T
(1)

This simplification is justified by the fact that stiffness of the simple materials used for reinforced con-
crete (RC) structures never exceeds an order of magnitude. In addition, in order to avoid shear locking
situations [7], the proposed scheme has been implemented using a Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle [8] where
the shear transverse strains are postulated to be neglected with respect to other strains.

The paper is organized as follows. We start by presenting the basic framework of the plate theory,
and later the proposed modification, to finally detail an implementation into the FE framework. Section 3
describes the application of the proposed scheme to non-linear materials, and consequently, to plates with
bending degradation. Finally, in section 4 it is shown the performance of the proposed plate scheme, and
are presented some numerical examples; in particular, a linear clamped beam, a linear clamped plate with a
notch, a non-linear clamped beam, an unreinforced concrete frame and a reinforced concrete frame.

2. Basic framework and FE implementation

2.1. Geometry and load.

The plate term is referred to a flat slender body, occupying the domain

Ω = {(x, y, z) ∈ R | z ∈
− t2,+ t2

 , (x, y) ∈ A ⊂ R2} (2)
where the plane Z = 0 coincides with the mid-plane (also referred as the geometrical along this work) of
the undeformed plate and the transverse dimension, of thickness t, is small compared with the other two
dimensions.

2.2. Kinematics

The infinitesimal kinematic for a plate always assume the following displacement fields:

u(x, y, z) = −zθx(x, y), v(x, y, z) = −zθy(x, y), w(x, y, z) = w(x, y) (3)

where u, v and w are the displacements along x, y and z axes respectively, and θx and θy are the rotations
of the transverse line elements about the x and y axes. Accordingly, a straight line element, normal to the
plate mid-surface in the undeformed configuration could either remain straight and normal according to the
classical Kirchhoff plate theory, or not necessarily normal according to Reissner [9] and Mindlin [10], being
the difference among such theories the effect of the transverse shear deformation.

Fig. 2 Middle plane deformation for a thin plate.

The use of classical theories for thin and thick plates applied to homogeneous plates is the best alterna-
tive. However, when it comes to laminated plates formed by layers made of composite materials, the use of
such theories is not sufficient to assess the in-plane deformation fields of their components. That is why this
paper proposes a scheme in which the in-plane displacements field u and v are evaluated according to the
mechanical and constitutive properties of the constituent materials.

First, let us assume the existence of points a and b. Point a is defined as the intersection of the middle
plane and the undeformed normal of the plate, whereas point b is defined as the intersection of the theoretical
deformation of the normal and the neutral (or mechanical) plane. The purpose of using points a and b is
to refer the displacement field w to point a, whereas point b will be the reference for rotations θx and θy,
consequently, it will be used as the reference for in-plane displacements u and v of the layers within the
laminate material. Figures 2.a and 3.a are used as an aid to express this idea. The case when a = b is where
the plate is formed by a homogeneous material, as depicted in figure 2.

Now, let us assume the particular laminate from figure 2.b in its layer 8 has a material stiffener than the
rest, leading to the case illustrated in figure 3.b. This is a , b, and the consequences is that the strains dis-
tribution although remain linear, no longer remain symmetrical to the middle plane, also there is a variation
in the stress distribution and in the generalized stresses σ̂, which in figure 3.c are represented using bending
moment M. From figure 3.b can also be noticed that at point b (neutral plane) the in-plane displacements
are equal to u = 0 and v = 0.

The same as for both thick and thin plate theories, the integration of the in-plane stresses σx, σy and γxy,
and the transverse shears stresses γxz and γyz define the stress resultant per unit length

where z has to be redefined as will be seen later.
According to the classification of the existing theories, the proposed scheme is a modification of the DB-

ESL, where it is taken into account the evolution of the eccentricity of geometric and mechanical planes of a

bi-dimensional element during the damage process, also, generalized stresses and strains have been referred
to the mechanical plane, not to the geometrical plane as occurs in the classical DB-ESL formulation.

2.3. FE implementation

Although the proposed integration scheme is easily extensible to any bi-dimensional plate element, here
the two-dimensional triangular FE developed by Batoz et al [8], depicted in figure 4 and commonly referred
as the DKT element, has been taken as the starting point. The D.O.F. for element DKT have been presented
in equation 1, and such element is based upon the assumption listed below.

As will be seen later, the evaluation of the flexural stiffness for a plate element Db is going to be the
cornerstone of this work, let us first point out that the corresponding value for a continuum material, as the
one depicted in figure 2 can be evaluated using equation 8.

Db =

C. Escudero et al / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 00 (2016) 1–31 7

The matrix D corresponds to the constitutive matrix of the material in plane stress. As can be seen in
equation 9, D has not been integrated along the thickness of the plate.

D =

 (9)
However, for a laminated material formed by materials with different mechanical properties, the previous

approach is limited, and it becomes necessary to express the flexural stiffness Db in terms of the geometrical
and mechanical properties of the kth layer [11], leading to equation 10, which basically is a more general
form of equation 8, since D is no longer constant along the thickness, hence

Db =

k (10)

where Di j has been defined in equation 9, k = 1, ..., n is the current layer, and n the total number of layers
within the laminated material.

Figure 2.c depicts a typical distribution of stresses and strains within a laminated material, although
properly speaking, it is not a laminated material at all, since it is composed by a one-single material. In
any case, figure 2 is necessary as a reference to locate the layers, the middle plane and to state the position
parameters zk−1 and zk within a laminated material (fig. 2.b).

In order to perform the proposed integration scheme over the thickness, equation 10 has to be redefined,
position parameters zk and zk−1 have to be redefined also. For convenience, they are named ẑk and ẑk−1 and
referred to the bottom of the plate now, as shown in figure 3.b. This lead us to the cornerstone of the proposed
scheme, which is the assessment of the neutral axis Z. To define Z, let us start defining the auxiliary matrix
D̂b.

in equation 11, for convenience yk = (ẑk + ẑk−1)/2, whereas tk = ẑk − ẑk−1, this is, the thickness of the layer

where the membrane stiffness Dm also has a role to play in the scheme and is defined as

finally, Ẑ
k

from equation 14 is defined in equation 15.

Ẑ

= ykI − Z (15)

Being I the identity matrix. With this new expression (eq. 14) the bending stiffness tensor is modified
by non-linear effects, result of material failure, by two different means. One corresponds to the variation of
the material stiffness matrix, which now has a lower stiffness as it is replaced by the secant tensor, and also
by the position of the layer respect the new neutral axis of the laminate.

Shall be remarked that Z will be evaluated at the beginning of a quasistatic loading process, and then in
every iteration once damage has occur within the given FE. Also, has to be pointed out that this integration
scheme is intended to be used with a secant tensor Dsec instead of D in equations 11, and 14, this in order to
reproduce the change in the position of the mechanical plane using non-elastic constitutive equation.

Using equation 16 is now possible to evaluate the in-plane strains for each of the layers.

3. Constitutive Formulation

In this section a brief description of the expected bending degradation is carried out, focusing on the
evaluation of the secant constitutive tensor Dsec which is required to reproduce the bending degradation that
arises when some layers within a laminated plate are beyond the elastic threshold and others are not.

3.1. Mechanical plane of a bending plate
Let us start considering the example shown in figure 5 where the layer distribution of a plate under a

monotonic bending stress is depicted. Layers of the laminated plate are formed by a homogeneous and
isotropic material, in such a way mechanical plane lays in the geometrical plane. Let us also consider that
the simple material forming the laminated plate is a concrete-like material, where there is a pronounced
difference among tension and compression damage threshold.

As bending moment monotonic load starts being applied, the expected distribution of strains along the
thickness would be the shown in figure 5.a, whereas stress distribution would be like the ones shown in
figure 5.b. Both stresses and strains corresponding to figures 5.a and 5.b would be in the elastic range.

As bending moment increases, material non-linearity would be reached. The expected response of the
laminate, in case of considering simple concrete, is such that only the layers under tension stress (since
tension is by far the less resistant stress) reach the non-linear range, and due to this, layers subjected to
compression forces undergo a gradual increase of stress. Consequently, strain level of a the composite
material slightly beyond the damage threshold would be as shown in figure 5.c, also, from such figure notice
that mechanical and geometrical axes no longer correspond. On the other hand, expected stress distribution
would be presented in figure 5.d.

Finally, if it stills imposing a bending moment up to a fully damaged state in the plate, strain distribution
would be very much alike at the ones presented in figure 5.e and the corresponding stress distribution shall
be the one shown in figure 5.f. The movement of the mechanical plane, using the same definition of equation
2, is found between the values:

Ẑ
k

− t2,+ t2
 (19)

being ii the diagonal terms of Ẑ
k

matrix. In order to get better accuracy to determine Ẑ
k
, becomes mandatory

to perform a finer layer distribution in the following cases:

• At the farthest zones away from the geometric axis of the shell, since such layers will be subjected to
the higher stresses while acting a bending stress.

• At zones where exists an abrupt change of stiffness, as is the case of the presence of steel reinforcement
within the concrete, no matter their position within the overall thickness.

The main idea of such layer distribution is to endow the proposed integration scheme, with the capability
of capturing the mechanical axis once the shell element has undergone a non-linear effect. The assumption
is that, when the element damages, the mechanical axis moves away from its original position toward one
end (according to the bending moment’s direction), and the nearest to one end, the more damage state is
able to represent.

3.2. Isotropic Damage Model
Continuum damage models (CDM) have been widely accepted as an alternative to deal with complex

constitutive behaviour [12, 13, 14, 15]. Among the different possibilities such a framework offers, the
simplest is the one referring to isotropic damage models where the non-linear behavior is monitored through
a single internal scalar variable called damage or degradation, d. The meaning of internal variable d is the
measurement of the loss of secant stiffness of the material, and it ranges from 0 for the undamaged material
to 1 for the fully degraded one (0 ≤ d ≤ 1) [16, 17]. The constitutive equation for an isotropic damage
model has the form:



10 C. Escudero et al / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 00 (2016) 1–31

Fig. 5 Schematic representation of range to move of mechanical axis.



C. Escudero et al / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 00 (2016) 1–31 11

σ = (1 − d)D : ε (20)

and the secant stiffness Dsec is defined as

Dsec = (1 − d)D (21)

Is important to remark that in the proposed scheme, during the degradation process, the gradual loss of
bending stiffness will be evaluated using the secant constitutive tensor of each layer. An overview of the
components conforming the model proposed by Oliver et al [16] is summarized in next paragraph.

a. a suitable norm, τ, used to compare different states of the deformation making possible to define
concepts such as loading, unloading and reloading.

b. a damage criterion, F(τ, r) ≤ 0, formulated in the strain or the undamaged stress space. The simplest
form of this criterion is:

F(τ, r) = G(τ) −G(r) ≤ 0 (22)

where τ is the norm described in (a), r is the damage threshold, and G(•) is a suitable monotonic
scalar function. Using equation 22, now damage is numerically defined to occur when G(τ) > G(r).

c. evolution laws for the damage threshold and the damage variable. Such laws are given by the rate
expressions:

ṙ = µ̇

ḋ = µ̇
∂F(τ, r)
∂τ

= µ̇
d G(τ)

dτ
(23)

where µ̇ is the damage consistency parameter used to define loading/unloading conditions according
to the Kuhn-Tucker relations.

µ̇ ≥ 0 ; F(τ, r) ≤ 0 ; µ̇F(τ, r) = 0 (24)

The norm G(τ) together with the damage criterion play the important role of defining the yield surface,
this is when G(τ) − G(r) = 0, this is particularly important, since most of the common yield surface can
be reproduced using an isotropic damage model, like the ones proposed by are Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb,
or the modification to the Mohr-Coulomb yield surface proposed by Oller [18] which are suitable to model
concrete-like materials. Ductile materials such as metals, on the other hand, can also be modeled using a
von Mises yield surface.

3.3. Secant tensor for elasto-plastic materials

Including the evolution of permanent deformations or plastic deformations in a CDM allows to represent
the behavior of ductile materials with an elasto-plastic behavior.

Although in this work the proposed scheme only focuses on an isotropic CDM, the concepts presented
here can also be extended to plastic damage models, like the one proposed by Oller in [18] where it is used
a normalized internal variable to represent the plastic damage κp. Range of values for κp are 0 ≤ κp ≤ 1,
such that if κp = 0 there is no plastic damage, and κp = 1 defines the total damage of a solid.

There are also other CDM which include the presence of permanent deformations on the mechanical
behavior of geomaterials [19, 20, 21, 22] especially in concrete subjected to compression. Such schemes
make use of internal variables to represented damage and permanent plastic deformation.



12 C. Escudero et al / Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 00 (2016) 1–31

The idea of using one single damage variable in a general form has been explored by Paredes [23] to
be applied in the assess of the natural frequency of vibration of structures. Paredes considers the different
existing possibilities to define the damage index d, and proposes the index deqv be a function of the yield
surface f (σ) defined as:

deqv = 1 −
f (σc)
f (σ)

(25)

hence, it is now possible to use the damage index deqv in equation 21 to obtain an equivalent secant tensor.
In equation 25 f (σ) is evaluated with the current tensor of stress, whereas f (σc) is evaluated with the tensor
of effective stresses that define the damage threshold of the material which is defined as

σc =


f ∗ 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

 (26)
where f ∗ is nominal threshold of the material’s resistance. For the case of concrete, such threshold is defined
by the resistance to compression, whereas for ductile materials such as steel, it is defined by the yield stress.

Finally, the use of equation 25 takes to the modification of equation 21 resulting in equation 27.

Dsec = (1 − deqv)D (27)

3.4. Two-scalar damage models

Other damage model highly extended to model the opening and closing of cracks due cyclic loads in
geomaterials is the one proposed by Faria et al in [24], here two scalar damage variables d+ and d− are
introduced as internal variables, so it is possible to distinguish among the damage produced by tensile
stresses (cracking) and the damage produced due compressive stresses (crushing). The nature of the scheme
proposed by Faria et al makes it more feasible for seismic analysis purposes.

Using the definition of the elastic secant constitutive tensor, the secant constitutive tensor can be evalu-
ated for this scheme as [24]:

Dsec =
∂σ

∂ε
= (1 − d+)

∂2Ψ+0
∂εe ⊗ ∂εe

+ (1 − d−)
∂2Ψ−0

∂εe ⊗ ∂εe
(28)

The use of two internal variables to reproduce the damage is an advantage in terms of the constitutive
analysis. On the other hand, it becomes cumbersome while trying to establish one single parameter that
define the degradation of the material. This can only be achieved with an equivalent damage index [25] (eq.
27).

3.5. Secant tensor for composite materials

The use of mixing theories allows the numerical simulation of composite materials formed by n simple
materials, being also possible to represent each of them with their own constitutive model. This is because
mixing theories function as a manager of constitutive models whose main function is to preserve the com-
patibility of deformations, the equilibrium of internal forces, and to take into account the corresponding
stiffness of each component.

Classical mixing theory (CMT), whose simpler expression is the rule of mixtures (ROM), was first
studied in 1960 [26] establishing the basis for subsequent developments. CMT takes into account the volume
fraction of the components but not its morphological distribution, since it assumes all component materials
experiment a pure parallel behavior (same strain in all directions). To overcome this strong limitation
Rastellini et al [27] developed a serial/parallel mixing theory (SP ROM) assuming that components behave
as a parallel material in the fiber alignment direction and as serial material in the orthogonal direction.
SP ROM will only be mentioned here, and reader may consult [27, 28] for a full reference for the basic

notations, definition and computational implementation. Also reader may consult references [29, 30] where
SP ROM formulation has been used to characterize reinforced concrete structures.

During a loading process, if any of the component materials reach the non-linear range, the constitutive
tensor of such material will change, and consequently, so the constitutive tensor of the composite material.
Hence, to take into account such change, the use of equations 29, 30 and 31 depicts the way the secant tensor
has to be evaluated using a SP ROM scheme.

and, Dsecpp is the component in parallel direction of the secant tensor, D

of the secant tensor, and Dsecps and D

sp are the components in serial and parallel direction. Finally, the secant

tensor for a composite material using a SP ROM is:

Dsec =

 (31)
Similarly, using the CMT, the secant constitutive tensor of a composite material is equal to

Dsec =
n∑

i=1

ikiDsec (32)

where ik and iDsec are respectively the volumetric participation and the secant constitutive tensor of material
i. In both cases, using either CMT or SP ROM Dsec of the constituent materials have to be obtained using
either equation 21 or equation 27.

3.6. Mesh objectivity of FE formulation response with strain softening
In continuum mechanics, it is known that the inclusion of strain-softening leads to the increment of

strains in narrow strips. This phenomenon is known as strain localization. Two major approaches may be
distinguished for analyzing crack propagation, namely: Discontinuous (or Discrete) Crack Approach (DCA)
and the Smeared Crack Approach (SCA).

The purpose of this section is only to point out in a briefly manner the strain-softening phenomena and to
describe the SCA, since is the approach used in this work. Reader may abound in the subject by consulting
reference [31] where a comprehensive review of the formulations used over the last 40 years for the solution
of problems involving tensile cracking, with both the DCA and the SCA has been carried out. Some brief
remarks on the SCA are listed below.

• The simplicity of this approach. SCA can be readily implemented in any non-linear FE code, by
simply writing a routine for a new material constitutive model.

• Re-meshing is unnecessary. Since the cracking material is assumed to remain continuum and material
properties (stiffness and strength) are modified to account for the effect of cracking.

• Mesh dependency. A drawback is that the total energy dissipated in the cracking process is propor-
tional to the size of the element.

Fig. 6 Fixed beam subjected to flexion.

The requirement that the result from the numerical modelling should be independent of the mesh choice
is named mesh objectivity. Several studies have been done to provide objectivity on the results independently
of the size of the FE mesh (Oliver [32], Oller [33], Oliver et al [34], Cervera and Chiumenti [35] Lubliner
et al [20], Martinez et al [36, 37], Paredes et al [25], among others).

4. Practical Examples

4.1. Linear clamped beam
The first example selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme is shown in figure

6. It is a beam fixed at one end with the other end free where a vertical load P = 10N is applied. The
total length of the beam is L = 0.72m, whereas the dimensions of the cross section are b = 0.04m and
h = 0.10m. The layer distribution of the laminated material is also depicted in figure 6, the thickness of
all layers are tk = 0.01m, all except layer 08 are formed only by a concrete matrix. Layer 8 on the other
hand, is a composite material formed by a volumetric participation of 90% of concrete which is reinforced
with 10% of steel fibre. Composite material for layer 8 will be modeled using the SP ROM [28]. Both
concrete and steel have been modeled using a elastic constitutive equation whose mechanical properties are
Ec = 3.5e7N/m2, νc = 0.20, Es = 2.1e11N/m2 and νs = 0.0, where subindexes c and s stands for concrete
and steel respectively.

Considering only x direction in equations 11, 12, 14, and 15, then

Z1,1 = 7.46x10

also, using the analogy with the beam of Euler-Bernoulli with EI = Db1,1, leads to state that

δa =

3Db1,1
= −4.56x10−3m ; θa =

2Db1,1
= 9.50x10−3rad (34)

where δa and θa are the displacement and the rotation at point a respectively (fig. 7).
The results shown in equation 34 will be used as the basis for the upcoming comparisons with two

modelling strategies. The first strategy consist in a mesh with 365 nodes and 576 two-dimensional triangular
FE combined with the proposed scheme, that for referencing purposes it will be named Sh01 from now on.
The second modelling strategy consists in 2880 elements and 14,837 nodes formed by 20-node Lagrangian
FEs, named Hex01 from now on.

The layer distribution for the laminated composite material depicted in figure 6 has been selected in order
to make comparison in terms of vertical displacement, but especially, in terms of horizontal displacements
among both models.

3 Constitutive Formulation

So far, the considered cases were assuming a linear behaviour of among the stresses and
strains relationship, in this section are presented numerical examples of a laminated
plates subjected mainly to bending stresses. The aim of this section is to point out that
with the proposed integration scheme along the thickness, a layered plate is perfectly
capable of reproducing the expected bending degradation that arises when some layers
are beyond the elastic threshold and others are not.

First, the expected behaviour due the damage evolution is briefly described, then,
numerical results obtained with proposed integration scheme over the thickness are
compared with obtained results from a model formed with hexahedron elements.

Let us considered the example shown in figure 7 where the layer distribution of a
plate under a monotonic bending stress is depicted. Layers of the composite material
are formed by a homogeneous and isotropic material, in such a way mechanical plane
lie in the geometrical plane. Let us also consider that the simple material forming the
laminated plate is a concrete-like material, where there is a pronounced difference among
tension and compression damage threshold.

As bending moment monotonic load starts being applied, the expected distribution of
strains along the thickness would be the shown in figure 7.a, whereas stress distribution
would be like the ones shown in figure figure 7.b. Both stresses and strains corresponding
to figures 7.a and 7.b would be in the elastic range.

As bending moment continues to impose, a non-liner response would be reached.

3 Constitutive Formulation

So far, the considered cases were assuming a linear behaviour of among the stresses and
strains relationship, in this section are presented numerical examples of a laminated
plates subjected mainly to bending stresses. The aim of this section is to point out that
with the proposed integration scheme along the thickness, a layered plate is perfectly
capable of reproducing the expected bending degradation that arises when some layers
are beyond the elastic threshold and others are not.

First, the expected behaviour due the damage evolution is briefly described, then,
numerical results obtained with proposed integration scheme over the thickness are
compared with obtained results from a model formed with hexahedron elements.

Let us considered the example shown in figure 7 where the layer distribution of a
plate under a monotonic bending stress is depicted. Layers of the composite material
are formed by a homogeneous and isotropic material, in such a way mechanical plane
lie in the geometrical plane. Let us also consider that the simple material forming the
laminated plate is a concrete-like material, where there is a pronounced difference among
tension and compression damage threshold.

As bending moment monotonic load starts being applied, the expected distribution of
strains along the thickness would be the shown in figure 7.a, whereas stress distribution
would be like the ones shown in figure figure 7.b. Both stresses and strains corresponding
to figures 7.a and 7.b would be in the elastic range.

As bending moment continues to impose, a non-liner response would be reached.
The expected response of the composite material is such that only the layers under
tension stress (since tension is by far the less resistant stress) reach the non-linear range,

Fig. 7 Vertical and in-plane displacement comparison.

The first point of comparison of the two models are the displacements shown in figure 7. The maximum
value obtained for the z displacement for model Hex01 is δHex01 = −4.79x10−3m (figure 7.a), while the
value obtained with the proposed scheme is δS h01 = −4.55x10−3m (figure 7.b), the latter having better
approximation compared with the value shown in equation 34.

On the other hand, figure 7.c is used in order to show a comparison among the x displacements of both
models. Also in figure 7.c is depicted the value of Z1,1 obtained in eq. 33, which according to the proposed
scheme, will be the reference plane to evaluate the in-plane displacements, and consequently the in-plane
strains and stresses for a plate element. As can be seen from such figure, the relationship among the in-plane
displacements for both models is exact. Values of the in-plane x displacements for model Sh01 have been
evaluated using the obtained value for the rotation θS h01 = 9.48x10−3 rad, whereas values for model Hex01
are the global displacements in x direction.

Also, a comparison in terms of strains and stresses can be performed more accurately if layer 08 from
model Sh01 is split into 8 layers, which leads to a total of 17 layers for model Sh01.

Comparison of the stresses undergone by steel fibres are presented in figure 8. Figure 8.a corresponds
to obtained results for model Hex01. In such figure it is also possible to appreciate the change in the stress
(compressive and tensile) within the same FE. This effect has been possible to be captured due to the type
of FE used, since 4-node and 8-node three-dimensional elements are not able to cast reliable results under
bending conditions, such FE have not been considered in this work. Hence, for bending cases, it is highly
recommended a quadratic approximation or higher [7], which makes computationally expensive the used
strategy for model Hex01, and naturally arises the reason of using the proposed scheme.

Figure 8.b, on the other hand, shows the stresses at the top of the reinforced layer for model Sh01, as can
be seen, the maximum tensile stress undergone by such layer is σxx = 2.710x107N/m2, which matches the
obtained for model Hex01 being σxx = 2.757x107N/m2. In both cases, such values are obtained in the fixed
end of the model. An excellent match among models is also achieved at the bottom part of the reinforced
layer, which for model Sh01 is depicted in figure 8.c. Figure 8.c reports the minimum undergone stress
σxx = −2.228x107N/m2, whereas for model Hex01 σxx = −2.204x107N/m2.

Fig. 9 Geometry and boundary conditions for a fixed plate.

4.2. Linear clamped plate with a notch

The proposed scheme is also efficient in cases where there are large discontinuities between the position
of the mechanical plane of adjacent FE’s. To demonstrate this fact, has been carried out the study shown in
figure 9, where is depicted the geometry of a plate fixed in one of their edges and containing two different
laminated materials. The layer distribution of both laminated materials is also depicted in figure 9, as can
be seen there, the basic difference among them is the notch imposed in laminated material 02. Figure 9 also
presents the loading conditions, mechanical properties of the material, and the geometry of the proposed
model.

The analysis has been carried out using two meshes, the first one composed by 20-node Lagrangian
three-dimensional element, and the second one with triangular DKT element with the proposed scheme.
The obtained results are presented in figure 10, where at the top is presented the deformed mesh for both
models, and at the bottom it is presented a comparison of the vertical displacement.

4.3. Non-linear clamped plate

Let us consider the example shown in figure 11, where a model subjected to bending moment is de-
picted. Two cases are considered, a shell element with the proposed integration scheme, and a conventional
hexahedron element. In both cases, boundary conditions will be the same, namely, one end fixed, and in the
other end, a vertical displacement monotonically increased will be imposed. Dimensions of the model are
72x36x10cm. For the shell model, it has been used a mesh with a total of 144 triangular elements with a
single integration point, on the other hand, the model with hexahedron elements has been performed using
a mesh with 720 finite elements with 8 integration points each.

Material properties of the plate are: Young’s modulus Exx = Eyy = 3.5E4MPa, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.2,
internal friction angle φ = 30°, compression strength σyc = 20MPa, tensile strength σyt = 2.0MPa, fracture
energy G f = 0.25kN/m and compression energy Gc = 26.0kN/m. In order to stay away of the definition
and evaluation of the fracture length, since for both bi-dimensional and three-dimensional elements different
theory may apply, fracture length will be fixed in both examples to lch = hgp = 3cm, where hgp is the length
of a Gauss point in the load direction of a hexahedron element. Finally, to assess the secant tensor of each
layer has been used equation 21 corresponding to an isotropic damage model.

Figure 12 depicts the evolution on the non-linear force-displacement response of both models. It is
easy to notice the excellent agreement achieved between the two models, although the layered shell element
slightly underestimated the response. Also it is easy to notice that bending moment at the support is equal
to Ma = PL. Values corresponding to imposed displacements δ1, δ2 and δ3 are used as a reference to the
information output for a random F.E (figures 13 and 14).

Once both analysis have been performed, the first comparison point is the deformation undergone by
both models, such comparison is shown in figure 13, as expected, damage takes place in the nearest elements
to the fixed end in both models. This seems obvious, since such elements are subjected to the highest levels

of tensile stresses at theirs top layers. In both cases, damage starts at the top most layers/elements, then it
propagates to the inner layers/elements.

In figures 14,(a), (b) and (c) four graphics are shown, from left to right they correspond to: damage
variable of the layer, strain distribution along thickness’s element, stress distribution along thickness and
generalized stress σ̂X . Such figures show the stresses and strains undergone by FE 50 (Fig. 13) at three
representative loading stages during the loading process.

First loading stage (fig. 14.a) correspond to an initial state of stresses at the end of the elastic range, singe
a slight damage begins at the top of the element. As seen, mechanical plane (blue horizontal line) matches
the geometrical plane (red horizontal line). Strains are depicted as a straight vertical line due to the scale
used to show the results (the same scale has been kept for the three figures), although such distributions shall
look very much alike the one shown in figure 13.a. On the other hand, stress distribution remains symmetric
in respect of geometrical plane.

The second loading stage is presented in figure 14.b, corresponds to the maximum bending stress in the
shell (Mmax = 7.774 kN ·m/m), and is also the point where damage along the layers of the element becomes
more visible, since mechanical (blue) and geometrical plane (ref) no longer correspond.

Finally, loading stage shown in figure fig. 14.c corresponds to a high damaged state (although not fully
damaged) where layers at the top of the element are fully damaged and a huge change in the position of the
mechanical plane has occur.

Additionally, in order to point out the biggest advantage of using this scheme, is proposed a different
model using the same geometry and boundary conditions shown in figure 11 with a slight change in the
layer distributions, however, the total thickness remains the same. Such change is due to the addition of
steel reinforcement fibers to enhance the bending resistance of the plate.

The layer provided with steel reinforcement is near the top of the laminate, its thickness is Thi = 3mm,
and has a volumetric participation of fiber equal to 5% embedded in a matrix of concrete. Mechanical
properties used for steel are: Exx = 2.1E5MPa; Eyy = 3.5E4MPa, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0, compression
strength σyc = 412MPa, tensile strength σyt = 412MPa, fracture energy G f = 20.0kPa ·m and compression
energy Gc = 20.0kPa ·m. Constitutive model adopted for mechanical behaviour of steel is the one proposed
by Oller in [18], where plastic internal variable κp takes the place of d in equation 21. To numerically
reproduce the composite behavior, has been used the SP ROM [28, 38], and has been split into 6 layers to
get a total amount of 15 layers within the laminated material.

The reason of using an non-symmetric arrangement of the layers with respect to the geometric plane, is
to show that, if in the linear range there is a difference between the position of the geometric plane and the
mechanical plane, such difference increases once the a monotonically increased displacement is applied.

Such effect can be appreciated in the obtained results once the analysis has been performed, a resume
of such results is presented in figure 15. Figure 15.a shows a comparison among the results obtained for
non-reinforced plate (previous example) and for a reinforced plate. There is a significant improvement in
the bending strength even with a small amount of steel reinforcement, in addition, there is no longer a brittle
failure, but degradation is presented in a more gradual manner.

The graph of figure 15.a also displays displacements δ1, δ2, δ3 and δ4 used as a reference for the output
results for F.E. 50 shown in figure 13, whose stresses and strains undergone are presented from figure 15.b
to 15.e. For display purposes different horizontal scales has been used in such figures.

The stresses and strains of studied FE corresponding to displacement δ1 = 1.25mm are depicted in figure
15.b. As can be seen, although at such loading step the element is in a linear range, already exists a difference
between mechanical (blue line) and geometrical plane (red line). On the other hand, the maximum bending
strength of the model is achieved when δ2 = 2.30mm (figure 15.c). From figure 15.b to 15.d it can be
noticed that there is no significant difference on the stresses or the strains undergone by the element at those
loading steps, neither there is a significant difference in the location of the mechanical axis. Figure 15.e,
on the other hand, depicts a significant change in the stresses accompanied with slight change of strains.
This is due to the degradation in the lower layers of the laminated material, this has caused a change in the
location of the mechanical plane, now it is somewhere inside the reinforced layers, and some of them are
under compressive forces.

The main advantage of the proposed scheme is to accurately reproduce the bending behavior of structures

5 Summary and Conclusions

The starting point of this work has been the use of a 3-node and 2-dimensional triangular
shell element with one Gauss point combined with the state-of-the-art rule of mixtures
theories for composite materials. Thus, make it possible to use composite materials
whose components can be modelled with non-linear constitutive equations.

modelled as laminate materials combining ROM and CDM. Also, the analysis can be performed without
high amount of computational resources, since it is not expensive to add more layers in order to make a
more refined analysis.

Some other representative examples have been chosen as a comparison, although the full potential of the
element presented here, can only be noticed using structures computationally expensive to reproduce due
to the meshing requirements. To reproduce next examples of this section, the proposed scheme has been
implemented into a DKT-OPT shell element [39], which is a triangular flat element with 18 D.O.F and with
drilling rotation. The arrange of the D.O.F used by the DKT-OPT is depicted in the vector of equation 35.

4.4. Unreinforced concrete frame

Practical examples presented in current section (4.4) and in the following (4.5) have been originally
proposed by Molina et al in [40].These correspond to numerical analyses made with solid 3D finite elements
and will be used as reference for comparison purposes, in order to show the potential of the proposed scheme.

An unreinforced concrete frame is presented, in which it is intended to reproduce the mechanical re-
sponse exhibited by a brittle material. Geometry of the frame is shown in figure 16.a, where dimensions are
presented in centimetres. For both cases, width of column C-01 and beam B-01 is 40 centimetres. In both
cases, the discretization along the thickness has been done using the dimensions depicted in table 1 for the
columns and the beams.

Figure 16.b shows a perspective of the mesh used, and the local bases used for the finite elements. In
figure 16.b it is also depicted, as a future reference, the hinges the structure will undergo during the loading
process. So, hinges H1 and H4 are the ones at the bottom of the columns, whereas hinges H2 and H3 are
expected to occur at the beam ends.

The present analysis has been performed using two loading phases, the first one correspond to the self-
weight loading condition, and the second one, corresponds to a push-over analysis, which is defined with
an horizontal monotonically increased displacement, imposed directly in the FE at the left top of the frame
(figure 16.a)

There is only one simple material used to model the current frame, it corresponds to concrete, whose me-
chanical properties agree with those used by Molina et al in [40], and for convenience have been reproduced
below.

• Elasticity modulus: Exx = Eyy = 2.5x104MPa

• Poisson’s ratio: υ = 0.20

• Yield criterion: Mohr Coulomb.

• Damage thresholds:

σyc = 30MPa

σyt = 3MPa

• Fracture and crushing energy:

Gc = 20.0kPa · m

Gt = 0.2kPa · m

• self-weight γ = 2500kg/m3

To assess the secant tensor of each layer has been used equation 21 corresponding to an isotropic damage
model. Finally, fracture length lch is defined equal to the root area of the finite element lch =

√
Ae.

Analysing the obtained results, a manifest brittle material behaviour is noticed in the force-displacement
response (fig. 17.a). The low performance of the concrete under tensile stresses, and the absence of rein-
forcing steel on it, conditioned a poor overall efficiency of the structural system. In order to carry out a
proper description of the obtained displacement-force response graph, it has been divided into 6 segments
and detailed in next lines. The values of the imposed displacements δ1 to δ6 with theirs corresponding reac-
tion are listed in table 2, whereas the corresponding deformation amplified 100 times are shown in figures
17.b to 17.g.

• Segment Oδ1, this is where the elastic response occurs, as can be seen, there is a good match among
initials stiffnesses obtained with the proposed scheme while compared with the reference solution.
This is straightforward since all FE are under an elastic range (a = b from figure 2).

• Segment δ1δ2, is where non-linear process starts, reaching the highest strength (at δ2) of the concrete
frame.

• Segment δ2δ3, shows an abrupt loss of stiffness. It is manifested with the appearance of hinges H1 and
H4 at the bottom of the columns. At this point no hinge has been formed at the column-beam joints.

• Segment δ3δ4: another lost of stiffness has occur, more abrupt even than the previous one. Similar to
the previous loading segment, the loss of stiffness is produced by the apparition of a new hinge (H3).

• Segment δ4δ5, at this loading segment, the structure withstand with only one remaining union rigidly
tied.

• Segment δ5δ6, finally structure yields, and the hinge H2 is formed. Beyond displacement δ6 it is
assumed the structure has lost its whole capacity to withstand lateral forces, which is also confirmed
by the deformation undergone (fig 17.g) where all expected hinges have been formed.

As can be seen, beyond displacement δ1 there is not an exact match between the reference solution and
the obtained results. However, the efficiency of the proposed scheme is proved with the obtained results
since has been possible to reproduce the abrupt degradation at the beam-column joint, and at the support of
the columns.

4.5. Reinforced Concrete Frame
Geometry and mesh for this model are similar to the one presented in section 4.4, i.e, they correspond

to figure 16. Also, loading conditions are the same, namely, two loading stages have been applied, first a
self-weight loading condition, and then, a monotonically increased displacement.

Mechanical properties used for modelling concrete, agree with the used in section 4.4, whereas mechan-
ical properties of steel fibres are reproduced below.

• Elasticity modulus: Exx = 2.1x105MPa; Eyy = 2.5x104MPa.

• Poisson’s ratio: υ = 0.00.

• Yield criterion: Von Mises.

• Damage thresholds:

σyc = 412MPa

σyt = 412MPa.

• Fracture and crushing energy:

Gc = 20.0kPa · m

Gt = 20.0kPa · m

• self-weight γ = 7845kg/m3.

Constitutive model adopted for mechanical behaviour of steel is the one proposed by Oller in [18],
where plastic internal variable κp goes from 0 to 1 which suits equation 21 since d is replaced by κp. Cross
sections of structural elements with steel reinforcement are presented in figure 18. Both sections have been
discretized using 34 layers with the thickness distribution shown in table 3. As can be noticed, the layer’s
thickness has been adjusted to the position of the steel reinforcement.

Figure 19.a displays the force displacement response for both analysis, the one carried out by Molina et
al [40] with four-nodded Lagrangian elements, and the one of the present work. From such figure it can be
seen a perfect matching between initial stiffness of both models. A slight difference appears for an applied
load close to 50kN, when damage in concrete starts (displacement δ1).

A higher difference takes place when the steel reinforcement at base of the columns, goes into non-linear
range (displacement δ2). The difference in the obtained results at point δ2 may be due to the difference in
the constitutive theory used to model the non-linear behaviour of the steel. Point δ3 of figure 19.a is where
the reinforced concrete frame presents its higher resistance to lateral forces, beyond such point, a slight
difference is presented between both results, the tendency depicted infers a plastic process taking place in
the steel reinforcement. Finally, beyond imposed displacement δ4 the response of both models are very
much alike.

Damage on bottommost layer is shown in figure 19.b whereas figure 19.c depicts the damage on the
topmost layer of the laminate material (see normal direction of local z axis on figure 16). The evolution of
the damage shows the same initial behaviour as the case studied in section 4.4, namely, it starts at the bottom

Present Work

Figure ?? displays the force displacement response for both analysis, the one carried
out by Molina et al [8] with four-nodded Lagrangian elements, and the one of the present
work. From such figure it can be seen a perfect matching between initial stiffness of both
models. A slight difference appears for an applied load close to 50kN, when damage in
concrete starts (point A).

As a conclusion, shall be remarked the fact that, the proper steel reinforcement
within the frame, gives the structural system efficiency, in terms of lateral loading re-
sistance and ductility.

5 Summary and Conclusions

The starting point of this work has been the use of a 3-node and 2-dimensional triangular
shell element with one Gauss point combined with the state-of-the-art rule of mixtures

of the columns, and then at the beam-column joint, however, due to the presence of steel reinforcement, a
most uniform distribution of damaged elements is achieved.

As a conclusion, shall be remarked the fact that, the proper steel reinforcement within the frame, gives
the structural system efficiency, in terms of lateral loading resistance and ductility.

5. Summary and Conclusions

The starting point of this work has been the use of a 3-node and 2-dimensional triangular shell element
with one Gauss point combined with the state-of-the-art rule of mixtures theories for composite materials.
Thus it makes it possible to use composite materials whose components can be modelled with non-linear
constitutive equations.

In this work has been proposed, developed and implemented in PLCD [41] a laminated shell element
able to reproduce the damage due to bending stresses (out-of-plane), besides of the typical damage due to
membrane stresses (in-plane), this without being necessary to introduce additional degrees of freedom into
its kinematics.

The use of bi-dimensional shell element capable to reproduce not only the damage due membrane stress,
but also the damage due to bending stresses, is mandatory to model complex three-dimensional structures.
Hence, the idea of this work comes with the necessity of keeping the complexity of the resulting formulation
for the FE to a minimum, and consequently, also the required computational resources, thus, make the
analysis of three-dimensional structures computationally affordable.

Main conclusions regarding the development of this work are listed below.

• The integration scheme over the thickness proposed in this work, combined with a bi-dimensional
triangular element has proved to be capable of reproducing the damage due to bending stresses, and
it is not necessary additional degrees of freedom.

• A significant advantage of the modification proposed to the DB-ESL theory, is being able to use
laminated materials combined with the state-of-the-art rule of mixtures theories for composites, which
in the case of the present work has been applied to model the behaviour of the reinforced concrete
confining elements. Also, the use of non-linear constitutive equations to model the behaviour of its
components is possible. This makes possible to model and assess the damage of three-dimensional
structures with a reasonable low requirement of computational resources.

• To extend the proposed scheme to a composite material is only required to obtain the secant constitu-
tive tensor Dsec of such composite.

• In order to achieve a fully optimized formulation, improve the efficiency of the analysis process,
and speed up both solution and convergence, a tangent stiffness matrix for the element have to be
formulated or evaluated using perturbations techniques.

• Although in this work good results have been obtained modelling beams and columns as 2DFEs
with the modification proposed to the DB-ESL approach, such examples were used for comparative
purposes, and to show the efficiency of the scheme. This modelling strategy is not a common practice,
since the nature of DB-ESL approach does not allow to take into account the out-of-plane shear
resistance conferred by the stirrups. For that reason, the proposed scheme should be combined with
another that allows to overcome this situation, or has to be used with caution in the damage assessment
of structural elements such as beams of columns when the out-of-plane steel reinforcement play an
important role.
