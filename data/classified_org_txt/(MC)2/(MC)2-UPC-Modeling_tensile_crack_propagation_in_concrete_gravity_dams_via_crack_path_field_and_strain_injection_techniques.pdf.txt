Abstract: This work investigates tensile crack propagation in concrete gravity dams by using some 

recently developed numerical techniques (crack-path field and strain injection techniques) [1-3]. The 

work carefully addresses aspects related to mesh independence, robustness and computational cost, 

which are the main issues in fracture modeling. The novel technique consists of a procedure to insert, 

in the selected domain areas, specific strain fields for enhancing the performance of the underlying 

finite elements in modeling fracture. Representative numerical simulations of concrete dams show the 

accuracy and robustness of the methodology. The code used for the simulations is open-source and 

available at http://www.cimne.com/compdesmat/. 

1 Introduction 

Nowadays, structural safety of large dams remains a great concern due to the high potential risk 

associated to this kind of structures. A dam failure, followed by a sudden flood wave, can result in 

large life losses and in strong environmental and economic impacts, as it was reported for several 

catastrophic failure cases [5, 6]. Historically, the main causes of significant dam failures are related to 

foundation defects (erosion, sliding on its rock foundation, etc.) [7-9]. Structural failures, when not 

directly caused by foundation movements, are less frequent but its importance should not be 

minimized in the design neither in the safety control of the dam. Due to the importance of these 

structures, it is a worldwide standard practice to monitor continually dams as a part of the safety 

control process [10], which supports afterwards the safety assessment and decision. On the other 

hand, quantifying realistically concrete dams’ safety factors is a complex engineering question that 

depends on multiple phenomena affecting the performance and resistance of the dam and its 

foundation.  

In this work attention is focused on crack propagation through the dam body. Cracks progressing deep 

inside gravity dams can seriously affect its structural safety. Computational failure analysis can be an 

effective tool for realistically predict the eventual crack profiles and the ultimate structural resistance, 

allowing improved estimation of the structural safety factor.

The importance of computational methods in assessing dams safety and damage was soon recognized 

by some authors in the 1980s, which have used linear elastic fracture mechanics [11-15] to perform 

the first computational simulations of fracture in concrete dams. These authors argued that, due to the 

large size of dams, the fracture process zone is small in front of the overall structure and therefore 

linear elastic fracture mechanics can be applicable with limited errors, since failure occurs in a brittle 

(or quasi-brittle) manner. On the other hand, other authors argue that, due to the specific 

characteristics of dam concrete (that can have characteristic length up to 10 times greater that 

common concrete), the non-linear effects should not be neglected, even for large dams [16, 17].  

Apart from this theoretical and important question, in the 1990s, nonlinear fracture analysis starts 

becoming further used in fracture modeling of concrete dams. Depending on the manner that the de-

cohesion process at the crack interface is modeled, two major descriptions were used: 

1. In the cohesive (or discrete) approach [18, 19] the non-linear mechanical behavior is 

described by introducing a traction separation law (relating the traction vector and the vector 

of displacement jump) along the surface where the decohesive process occurs (typically 

coincident with the element sides). 

2. In the continuum approach [20-23] the non-linear mechanical behavior at the interface is 

described by a standard stress-strain constitutive equipped with softening, to account for the 

stress release associated to failure. Here the main assumption consists in admitting that the 

displacement jump can be captured in a smeared manner throughout the localization band.  

In both approaches fracture energy plays a fundamental role in order to make results physically 

meaningful (ensuring correct energy dissipation and overcoming the mesh size dependence). The 

main flaw of the initial methods based on these approaches was the spurious dependence on the mesh 

alignment, which is critical because different meshes can deliver different results, in terms either of 

the crack trajectory or of the dissipated energy. The main consequences of mesh dependence 

phenomena are well documented in the literature, and consist, essentially, in two types of undesirable 

behavior: 

 Mesh bias dependence: Refers to the spurious tendency of the crack to follow certain 

preferred directions related to the mesh alignment, i.e. the crack tends to propagate 

parallelly to the element sides avoiding zigzagging. The main inconvenience of this 

dependence is that it can lead to unrealistic\unphysical failure mechanisms, with 

consequences also in the ultimate structural load carrying capacity, which may be over or 

under-estimated. 

 Stress locking effects: Refers to the lack of ability of finite elements to capture strain 

localization, in a one-element-width localization band, without spurious stress transfer to 

the neighboring elements. The principal inconvenient of stress locking is the extra 

dissipation that occurs in elements outside the localization band which results in an over-

stiffer behavior that leads to an overestimation of the ultimate structural load carrying 

capacity, which is not on the safety side. 

Despite these limitations, which make re-meshing techniques mandatory to obtain mesh independent 

results, interesting applications to concrete dams have been reported in the literature by using both 

cohesive [4, 24, 25] and continuum models. The fact that the continuum approach can be implemented 

in a standard non-linear finite element code by just introducing strain softening in the constitutive 



3 

model, made the approach widely used and various constitutive models were explored for modeling 

crack propagation in concrete dams. For example in [17, 26] applications by using smeared crack 

models are reported and in [27-30] the authors have applied damage/plasticity based models. 

In the 1990s, aiming to overcome the flaws of the classical methods, new developments and 

enhancements have been proposed in the context of the continuum models. Depending on how the 

crack/slip-line (displacement jump) is captured by the numerical methods, the continuum approaches 

can be classified in three groups: 

 The strain-localization-based methods, in which, due to strain softening, strains tend 

naturally to localize in narrow bands that under ideal conditions encompass just one finite 

element. This approach corresponds to the aforementioned, firstly proposed, continuum 

models. These are the most conceptually simple and intuitive models for simulating crack 

propagation
1
 but are known to suffer from mesh bias dependence and stress locking flaws. 

 In the supra-element-band methods, a regularized displacement jump is captured by a 

band of finite elements encompassing several elements across it. The bandwidth is then 

considered a characteristic length. This class of models include material-regularization-

based approaches (non-local, gradient or Cosserat models [31, 32] and the, more recent, 

phase field models for fracture [33]). In general, good results are obtained, although the 

fact that the size of the finite element is smaller than the, very tiny, characteristic length 

implies that a huge number of elements are required, this leading to large computational 

costs. 

 In the intra-elemental methods, the discontinuity interface settles inside the finite 

element, thus, no restrictions in the size of the finite elements exist and very coarse 

meshes can be used. In these methods, the finite elements are enriched with additional 

discontinuous displacement modes and are termed E-FEM or X-FEM if the support of the 

additional modes is elemental or nodal based, respectively. The performances of both 

methods are similar [34], but some computational benefits from the E-FEM side can be 

obtained due to the elemental support of the enriching modes that can be condensed out , 

this leading to a lower computational cost. 

However, in both methods, robustness depends on the precise determination of the position of 

the discontinuity and this, is classically done by means of crack-tracking algorithms that are 

cumbersome to implement, have a code-invasive character and may seriously affect the 

robustness of the method [35]. These drawbacks seem to be responsible for its little use in 

modeling real-life problems and in commercial codes incorporation.  

Outside the finite element framework, alternative methodologies, of diverse natures, have been also 

proposed for material failure modeling: 

 In the discrete element methods [36, 37] the idea of continuum media is left aside being 

formulated in terms of rigid discrete elements that interact with each other according to 

contact laws. For modeling fracture in structures without “a-priori” preferable failure

 These classical models do not require any enhancement more than a proper regularization of the softening 

modulus for ensuring a correct dissipation of energy. 



4 

surfaces, the discrete elements are generally chosen to be circular or spherical particles and 

the corresponding inter-particle contacts can either be assumed as brittle or following a given 

softening curve [38, 39]. These methods model directly the meso-structure of the materials 

being therefore computationally more demanding than the continuum models (that are at the 

macro-scale level). 

 The lattice models have been initially developed to deal with random heterogeneous materials 

[40]. The structure is discretized as a lattice composed of Bernoulli beams that transfer 

normal forces, shear forces and bending moments. Usually linear elastic analyses are 

performed and beam elements that exceed tensile strength are removed [41, 42], and 

consequently, their inertial effects are neglected. 

 Multi-scale approaches with different theoretical background have been proposed (see [43] 

for a general insight). Usually, in these approaches two distinct length scales are considered: 

one corresponding to the structural size (macro scale) and other corresponding to the zone, 

near the crack tip, where the fracture is being processed, which intends to capture the complex 

phenomena of fracture deriving from the material micro-structure (e.g. the atomistic 

simulations of [44]). 

In the last two decades, some of the previous mentioned E-FEM and X-FEM methods, material-

regularization-based approaches, phase field models, discrete/lattice and multi-scale approaches have 

attracted large interest of the computational mechanics community, and a huge number of papers have 

been published in the different fields of research. However, so far, applications were mostly restricted 

to academic benchmarks and few cases of real-life structures have been reported [45]. For this reason, 

these methods are no regarded, yet, as a true reliable alternative for modeling crack propagation in 

concrete dams, such that can help in the design or in the safety control of these large structures. Some 

flaws of these methods that make general authors to be reluctant in using them are the following: 

 Higher computational cost relatively to the more classical methods, with consequences in the 

computational times and, thus, in productivity. 

 Increasing theoretical complexity, which makes the new methodologies less appealing for 

more “practical” developers and general engineers. 

 Difficulties of implementation in standard non-linear finite element codes. In some cases, the 

intrusive character of the formulations, make the methodologies quite cumbersome to 

implement. This can be a dissuasive factor for new implementers and developers. 

 Unavailability of commercial or open-source software. Most of these new numerical 

techniques have not been yet incorporated to commercial codes. The insufficient interest of 

commercial companies can be related with the three flaws enumerated previously. Regarding 

to the lack of open-source software, usually, in the computational failure mechanics field, the 

developing authors do not distribute their computational codes in open source formats or, if 

so, the code is not properly publicized (for example in the corresponding paper).  

1.1 Objectives and main assumptions of the work 

In this work, the departure point are the recently developed crack-path-field and strain-injection 

techniques [1-3, 46], that have proved to be a valuable tool for capturing propagating material failure 

in a set of 2D “quasi-static” academic benchmarks. The main novelty of this method is the 



5 

introduction of the strain injection concept, i.e. the imposition of goal-oriented strain-fields, in 

selected areas of the domain and at specific stages, to improve the performance of the resulting model 

in capturing propagating material failure.  

In fact, a proper combination of these techniques (crack-path field and strain injection) and a 

stabilized mixed formulation leads to a general mesh independent methodology ready for failure 

modeling of real-life large concrete structures, like concrete dams. The methodology provides the 

classical advantages (mesh independence and low computational cost) of the intra-elemental methods 

while being minimally intrusive for the simulation code in which it is implemented. These interesting 

properties allow us to think that the new techniques show a strong potential to be competitive in front 

of other promising approaches aiming at capturing propagating cracks (the phase-field models [47], 

the full mixed approach
2
 of [48] and the recent improvements to the strong discontinuity approach 

either in the E-FEM or X-FEM versions [49-51], etc.).  

So far, the methodology was implemented only for 2D cases, with applications limited to isothermal 

quasi-static problems. The kinematical description of the motion is also simplified to infinitesimal 

strains. The authors are aware that seismic analyses, in which inertial effects cannot be neglected, are 

one of the main actual concerns in terms of dam structural safety and, therefore, it will be considered 

in subsequent work. Notice that by neglecting the inertial effects, more realistic comparisons with 

experimental results can be performed since physical phenomena difficult to quantify and measure, 

like the damping mechanisms, play no role. In quasi-static cases, the necessary physical parameters to 

introduce in the model are limited to the elastic constants (Young’s modulus and Poisson's ratio), the 

ultimate tensile strength and the material fracture energy, which can be measured in laboratory. 

Moreover, the interior fluid pressure in the open cracks was also neglected. Although the authors are 

well aware of the importance of this issue (hydraulic fracture), this is not in the scope of this work, 

which is essentially devoted to evaluate the benefits of the proposed computational methods for 

modeling crack propagation in dams. 

The main objective of the present paper is to assess the capabilities of the new numerical tools, so far 

with applications limited to some academic benchmarks, in modeling tensile crack propagation in 

concrete dams. The theoretical summary of the methodology presented in sections 2, 3 and 4, has the 

exclusive goal of providing the reader with the general ideas about the method and it does not pretend 

to be exhaustive. In [1] a deeper presentation of the formulation and its implementation details can be 

consulted by the interested readers. 

The numerical simulations, in section 5, show the potential of the methodology to model fracture 

propagation in concrete dams. Aspects related to mesh independence (mesh bias and stress locking), 

robustness, and computational cost, which are the main issues in material failure modeling, are 

carefully addressed.

 This mixed approach uses continuous interpolations both for the displacements and the strains. The 

computational cost is higher due to the increased number of degrees of freedom per node: from 2 

(displacements) to 5 (2 displacements plus 3 strains) in 2D cases.

2 Finite element setting. Variational approaches to the mechanical problem 

2.1 Displacement based finite element formulation 

Standard finite element formulations of the non-linear mechanical problem (summarized in Box 1) are 

usually displacement-based, in the sense that the displacement field, u , is the independent unknown 

to be interpolated by using some suitable interpolation functions. The strains, , are computed from 

the compatibility equation, (3), and the stresses, , via the constitutive relation, (4). The one field 

variational equation corresponding to the equilibrium equation of the mechanical problem in Box 1 

reads (in rate form):

Equation (1) is equivalent to the classic virtual work principle where *( , )extW b t  stands for the work 

produced by the external forces and

prescribed displacements, tractions and body loads, respectively. 

In the context of material failure modeling, it is well known that displacement based finite element 

formulations are not adequate for modeling highly concentrated strain localization processes as the 

ones that occur in the onset of crack initiation and propagation. 

2.2  Mixed 1/ 0u  formulation 

An alternative approach is the one based on two fields: displacements and strains, /u , in which both,

In contrast with the one-field approach in equation (1), the two field format in equation (6) opens a

context of the assumed strain methods [52], this providing additional freedom in the choice of the 

strains that can lead to formulations with enhanced kinematics and flexibility, which might be 

valuable for material failure modeling.

REMARK 2-1 It can be shown the equivalence of the mixed /1 0u  formulation for 

quadrilateral elements in equation (9) with the reduced integration of displacement based 

formulation [1-3, 53], which is known to be unstable when applied to the whole domain 

B . In practice the instability is noticeable by the spurious propagation of zero energy 
(hourglass) displacement modes that become dominant and pollute the solution in terms 

of the displacement field.  

2.3 Stabilized mixed 1/ 0u  formulation 

In the past, to overcome the instability originated by reduced integration methods, diverse 

stabilization procedures and hourglass control techniques, with different theoretical foundations, have 

been proposed. [54, 55]. Here we use the stabilization term proposed in [1-3]

Where ( ) ( ) [ , ]e t 0 1  is a stabilization parameter, which, can be specific for every element and evolve

 The proposed stabilization term in equation (10) falls into the family of consistently stabilized methods (see 

[56, 57]). The consistency of the stabilization stems from equation (7-b), which implies that with mesh 

refinement ( )e s hu , this meaning that the stabilization term in (10) vanish with mesh refinement 
regardless of the value of the stabilization parameter.

The stabilized mixed formulation in equation (11) can be regarded as a weighted combination of the 

irreducible displacement based formulation (fully integrated term) and the mixed displacement-strain 

formulation (reduced integrated term), weighted by ( )e and ( )( )e1  respectively.

where

 are termed the stabilized stresses.  

REMARK 2-2 Analyzing expression (12), it is noticeable that, for 
( )e 1  the method is 

equivalent to the standard irreducible formulation, whereas for 
( )e 0 , the stabilization 

term vanishes and the unstable mixed formulation is recovered. In previous works of the 

authors [1, 3], was found that 
( )

.
e 0 1  provides a good balance, since the hourglass 

instabilities of the pure mixed formulation are avoided while keeping the improved 

properties of the formulation for strain localization modeling. 

REMARK 2-3 The improved properties of the stabilized mixed formulation were shown 

in [1, 3] and are related to the improved flexibility of the finite elements kinematics, 

which largely enhance the propagation capabilities of the elements (strongly alleviating 

mesh bias defects). On the other hand, the kinematics still exhibits a limited capability 

for describing the mechanical behavior of a crack inside a finite element without spurious 

stress transfer to the neighboring elements (stress locking phenomena). For this reason 

some strain injection modes will be applied. 

3 Strain-injection techniques  

Strain injection refers to a general numerical technique that consists of inserting, in selected parts of 

the domain and during different stages of the simulation, specific strain fields, that have the goal of 

enhancing the performance of the finite elements. The key point of this technique is to split the 

domain into two disjoint subdomains: the injection domain, injB , where some enhanced strain modes 

are injected, and the remaining part of the body where the underlying finite element formulation is 

used (see Figure 1).

3.1 Strain-injection techniques and mixed formulations for failure analysis 

For modeling tensile crack propagation in concrete gravity dams we propose to use the mixed 

stabilized finite element formulation
4
 (presented in section 2.3), as the underlying formulation, due to 

its improved performance for modeling strain localization processes. Therefore, considering a finite 

element discretization and the domain split of Figure 1, the variational equation of the mechanical 

problem (equivalent to the virtual work principle) can be written as:

(13) 

Where the work produced by the internal forces is computed by the sum of two terms. The first one, 

the mixed term, corresponds to that part of the domain where the mixed stabilized formulation of 

equation (12) is used. The second term, the strain injection term, corresponds to that part of the 

domain where a specific strain field, 
( )e
inj , is injected in the constitutive equation  of those 

elements, 
( )eB , belonging to the injection domain, ( )inj tB . Here, new equations defining the enhanced 

strain modes, 
( )e
inj , should be added to the system (see section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2). 

3.2 Strain-injection modes  

In the context of material failure modeling, the injected strain modes have the goal of enhancing the 

performance of the finite elements in capturing strain localization such that the mechanical behavior 

of a crack can be captured inside the finite elements without spurious stress locking effects. In [1] two 

strain fields were proposed to be injected in quadrilateral elements: the constant strain mode and the 

discontinuous displacement mode. 

3.2.1 Constant Strain Mode (CSM) injection 

The constant strain mode injection consists of assuming constant strains within the finite element. 

This can be formalized by using the displacement-constant strain mixed formulation ( / inj1 0u ) of 

section 2.2, but now exclusively restricted to the injection domain, that is, the compatibility equation 

is weakly imposed only for those elements belonging to the injection domain:  

                                                      

4
 Here we propose a modification in the methodology relatively to the previous works of the authors [1, 3] (in 

which the irreducible displacement formulation was used as underlying formulation). In section 3.4 we explain 

the motivation for this option.

REMARK 3-1 The injection kinematics proposed in equation (15) is equivalent to the 

kinematics of the unstable mixed formulation in equation (8). The key difference is that 

(15) is just used in those elements belonging to the injection domain. We would like to 

remark that, using this injection concept, no stabilization is needed for the injected elements, 

since the use of the mixed stabilized formulation, of equation (12), in the larger part of 

the domain, prevents hourglass displacement modes to propagate at the structural level 

(rather than at the element level by stabilization). 

REMARK 3-2 The CSM injection proposed in (15) still cannot resolve the discontinuity 

inside the finite element without stress locking (for general situations), but it provides a 

slight increase of flexibility in those finite elements that are good “candidates” to develop 

discontinuities, thus establishing a transitory stage to the Discontinuous-Displacement 

Mode (DDM) injection that will be presented at section 3.2.2. 

3.2.2 Discontinuous-Displacement Mode (DDM) injection 

The discontinuous-displacement mode injection consists of enriching the element kinematics with the 

strong discontinuity kinematics (summarized at Box 2) such that the mechanical behavior of the crack 

can be perfectly captured inside the finite element without spurious stress transfer to the neighboring 

elements (stress locking phenomena).

Following the same process than in section 3.2.1, the two-field ( /u ) mixed formulation of section 3 

can be extended to a three-field ( ˆ / /u u ) formulation which requires therefore, two additional 

equations. One comes from imposing weakly the equality between the regular part of the strong 

discontinuity kinematics, ( )ˆ e , in equation (16) and the regular constant strain,

3.3 Injection domains 

After defining the strain modes to be injected, the subsequent questions to be posed are where and 

when these strain modes should be injected in order to effectively improve the performance of the 

finite elements for capturing strain localization. The answer to these questions is given by selecting 

proper injection domains. In the context of material failure modeling it is intuitively reasonable that 

the proposed strain modes should be injected in that part of the body where the fracture is being 

processed. By this reason the definition of the injection domains ( )inj tB  is grounded on consistent 

mechanical criteria, such as the discontinuous bifurcation analysis that qualifies a stress/strain state as 

compatible with the onset of a discontinuous displacement field. Two conditions are required to be 

fulfilled at the finite element barycenter

 After condensing the field

 at the element level, the finite element formulation simplifies in a two field 

formulation ( ˆ /u u ). To solve the displacement jump, u  , traction continuity is imposed at the 
discontinuity surface (

Approach (CSDA) (see [58]).

Conditions in equation (21) can be described as: 

1- The discontinuous bifurcation condition has been fulfilled in a previous time ( ( )( )eB Ct t x ) 

where t stands for the actual time and Bt  is the bifurcation time. 

2- The element is in in-loading regime at the current time ( ( )( , )eC tx 0 )
7
 since unloading 

elements cannot localize. 

The injection domain, injB , is that part of the domain where several strain mode injections can be 

performed (it has common conditions for all possible injections). In preceding sections two strain 

modes were proposed: the CSM and the DDM. Therefore two sub-sets of injB  ( locB  and disB ) where 

these strain modes are respectively injected must be defined, such that: ( ) ( ) ( )inj loc dist t tB B B  and 

( ) ( )loc dist tB B  

3.3.1 The discontinuity injection domain 

The discontinuity injection domain ( ) ( )dis injt tB B , in which the discontinuous displacement mode 

(DDM) is injected, is the set of elements that have bifurcated and, in addition, are effectively 

developing a strain localization process
8
. The defining conditions, for a finite element to be part of the 

discontinuity domain, are three:

2- The element has achieved a “sufficient degree of softening”
9

the stress-like internal variable,

 Notice that not all the bifurcated elements develop cracks; some of the elements that initially bifurcated unload 

elastically in subsequent time steps. 

9
 This condition has the aim to guaranty that the element not only has bifurcated but is effectively developing a 

consistent strain localization process.

3- The element is crossed by the discontinuity path t . In order to inject the DDM effectively, the 

discontinuity path should be identified little in advance. In the context of the strain injection 

techniques this is obtained by the Crack-Path Field technique described in Section 4. 

3.3.2 The localization domain 

This domain, where the constant strain mode is injected, includes all the in-loading bifurcated 

elements (belonging therefore to the injection domain, equation (21)) which do not verify, yet, the 

conditions for belonging to the discontinuity domain (equation (22)), i.e.: 

( ) ( ) \ ( )loc inj dist t tB B B . (24) 

Typically, this set of elements evolves very quickly during the loading process. In fact, part of the 

elements that initially bifurcate, tend to unload elastically in subsequent stages leaving, therefore, the 

injection domain, while others, crossed by the discontinuity, remain developing strain localization 

until verifying conditions in (22). At that moment those elements become part of the discontinuity 

injection domain, disB  (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 where two typical strain injection-loading processes 

are depicted). 

3.4 Summary and motivation 

In previous works of the authors, the strain-injection techniques were used in combination with a 

standard displacement-based finite element formulation whereas in the present work, we propose a 

modification consisting of using, as underlying formulation, the mixed stabilized mixed formulation. 

The reasons for this option are mainly related to the brittleness of the fracture process in large 

structures, as is the case of concrete dams, since, due to smaller size of the fracture process zone in 

front of the overall structure size, the fracture type approaches a brittle fracture process [11-15].

In the previous works the strain injection techniques were applied to a set of quasi-brittle fracture 

academic benchmarks and, for that case, yielding or damage occur in a diffuse manner in the 

neighborhood of the crack tip. In the context of the strain injection techniques, this was translated into 

a set of elements evolving in the front of the crack tip, being injected by a constant strain mode, which 

was then regarded as an “enhancement bulb”, (see Figure 3) improving the flexibility and propagation 

capabilities of the finite elements. 

 

Figure 3 Evolution of the injection domains for three typical stages of loading in quasi-brittle fracture. 

Instead, when modeling fracture propagation in concrete dams, due to the brittle behavior, the fracture 

process zone is much smaller
10

, and the enhancement bulb reduces, almost, to the elements crossed by 

the discontinuity (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 for an illustration).  

 

Figure 4 Evolution of the injection domains for three typical stages of loading in brittle fracture. 

The principal inconvenient of this issue is that the enhancement bulb is too small (very few elements 

are injected with the more flexible constant kinematics) to avoid mesh alignment dependence. The 

choice for using the mixed stabilized formulation allow us to overcome this issue without drawbacks 

and with the advantage of constructing a more general methodology that can be used for modeling 

crack propagation for both large and small size structures. 

With the definition of the strain modes and the respective injection domains in hand, equation (13) 

can be specified as follows: 

                                                      

10
 Hence a very fine mesh would be required in the fracture process zone.

REMARK 3-3 The mixed stabilized formulation in the first term of equation (25) brings 

extra flexibility to the proposed methodology, enhancing the propagation capabilities of 

the finite elements. Then, the injections proposed in section 3.2 allow resolving the 

discontinuity inside the finite element without spurious stress transfer. The final result is 

a mesh independent methodology ready for modeling the failure of real-life large 

concrete structures like concrete dams.  

REMARK 3-4 The formulation proposed here is very general in the sense that it can be 

used for modeling strain localization for both large and small size structures. Moreover it 

can deal also with the locking effects arising from constitutive models that do not exhibit 

plastic change of volume, as is the case of J2 plasticity model (see [1]). 

REMARK 3-5 The strain injection procedures proposed in this work, crucially rely on 

the incremental character of the injected strains, this allowing the smooth evolution, 

along time, of the corresponding strains and stresses, consistently with the evolutionary 

character of the injection domains. That is the reason for the mechanical problem of Box 

1 to be stated in rate form.  

4 Crack path field technique 

Finite element formulations, either displacement-based or mixed ones, considering non-linear 

constitutive models equipped with strain softening (local, nonlocal, etc.), are widely used for studying 

fracture, which is represented by strain concentration in narrow bands. The crack path-field technique, 

proposed in [1-3], has the goal of determining the position of a strong discontinuity, , represented 

by a diffuse strain localization field obtained from one of these methods.  

4.1 One-dimension-problem: Motivation 

The motivation for the numerical technique is very intuitive and can be illustrated, for the one-

dimensional continuum case, as shown in Figure 5. The basic idea is to understand the diffuse 

localized field  as a regularization of a strong discontinuity whose position, , can be assumed at 

the maximum value of the continuum function . In practice, the maximum of the continuum function 

, can be determined by the zero value of its derivative.

Considering now the discrete case (as obtained from a linear finite element interpolation) shown in 

Figure 6, where the variable  is available at the sampling points, the strategy to determine the 

position of 
 
is the following:

 is obtained by a double 

smoothing procedure of the localized variable h  (Figure 7). Then the crack-path 

position  is determined as the zero level set of

Notice that in some points outside the localization zone the function 
h

 takes also null 

values (see Figure 6 b)) not corresponding to maxima of h , but instead, corresponding 

to the trivial case: 

h

In practice, these not interesting zones of h 0  (not corresponding to ) do not 

introduce any additional trouble since they are located in elements outside the non-linear 

zone where no strains localize and so are easily identified by the numerical procedure as 

non-interesting zeros.

implementation details, can be consulted by the interested readers. More information can 

also be found in [2, 3]. 

REMARK 4-3 In order to perform the discontinuous mode injection two typical 

questions arise: a) Which elements have to be injected? b) For the injected elements, how does the 

discontinuity cross the finite element? In the context of the strong discontinuity approach, this 

information is generally obtained by resorting to global tracking algorithms [59]. Here, 

the strain-injection technique is used in combination with the described crack-path field

technique. A crucial issue of the method is that the crack-path-field has to be sufficiently 

well captured at the time of the DDM injection. In order to achieve this goal a delay in 

the DDM injection has to be imposed. This delay is controlled by the parameter  in 

equation (23). From the author’s experience,  provides a good balance between 

the (little) error produced by delaying the injection and the need of having reliable 

information from the crack-path field technique prior to that injection.  

5 Representative numerical simulations 

In this section two representative numerical simulations of gravity concrete dams were studied. The 

first example consists of a concrete dam scale model (of a 96-m-high gravity dam) where 

experimental measurements obtained in a laboratory are available for comparison [4]. The second 

example consists of a full-scale concrete gravity dam (Koyna dam), which has been used as a case 

study by numerous researchers [14, 17, 26, 27, 45, 51].  

For the material behavior modeling, a plasticity-based Rankine constitutive model equipped with 

strain softening (properly regularized such that dissipation matches the material fracture energy) is 

used. It is not the first time that a Rankine model, implemented within the framework of plasticity 

theory, is used for material failure modeling of concrete structures. In [60] a Rankine plasticity model 

was used for modeling mode-I crack propagation in some academic benchmarks. 

In this work, for the integration of the constitutive equation, an implicit-explicit (IMPL-EX) scheme 

[61, 62] is used, which translates in a high increase of robustness of the numerical procedure when 

compared to fully implicit integration schemes, in which lack of robustness issues are well known in 

the context of computational failure modeling [63]. 

5.1 A gravity dam model 

In [4] Carpinteri et al. experimental tests of scale-down models of a gravity dam have been reported. 

The models have a horizontal notch on the upstream side and the experimental test was driven by 

controlling the crack mouth opening at that notch. Figure 8 illustrates the experiment setup, including 

the model dimensions, the position of the notch and the equivalent hydraulic loads. The finite element 

mesh and the mechanical properties used in the numerical model are also shown in the figure. 



19 

 

Figure 8 Dam model, finite element mesh and mechanical properties used in the numerical model, being 

u  the ultimate tensile strength, E  the Young’s modulus, v  the Poisson’s ratio and fG  the fracture energy. 

In the numerical simulations, the loading process was performed by applying, in a first stage, the self-

weight loads and, in a second stage, the hydraulic loads. The second stage is carried out through a step 

by step Newton-Raphson scheme in which the crack mouth displacement at the notch is controlled by 

using arc-length techniques. All the computations were performed under plane strain conditions. 

In Figure 9 quantitative responses for three different options are depicted in terms of the force–

CMOD (Crack-Mouth-Opening Displacement) curves. The “strain injection” curve was obtained by 

using the strain injection techniques described in this work, while the “experimental” and “cohesive 

model curves” were obtained by Carpinteri et al, being the former experimentally measured and the 

later numerically computed by using a cohesive crack model supported in an automatic remeshing 

processes, at each crack growth step, so that the crack lies in the finite element mesh sides. 

Figure 9 shows an excellent agreement between both numerical solutions. The obvious advantage of 

the strain injection technique is that no remeshing process is needed. Relatively to the comparison 

with the experimental solution the peak load is well captured although the post peak response curve is 

much stiffer in the experimental test. Reasons for this may relay on some issues of the experimental 

set-up that are missed in the numerical model.

5.1.1 Mesh dependency analysis 

When modeling material failure, mesh dependence is a critical issue since different meshes can 

deliver different results, in terms either of the crack trajectory or in terms of the dissipated 

energy. Mesh dependence phenomena is well documented in the literature and displays essentially 

two types of undesirable behavior that are summarized in Section 1: Mesh bias dependence and 

stress locking effects. 

In order to assess if the results obtained by using the injection techniques are mesh independent, 

comparative analysis were carried out by using two different fine meshes: one structured and another 

unstructured (Figure 12). Additionally, the obtained results are also compared with the ones coming 

from standard displacement-based (irreducible) formulations, which are known to suffer from mesh 

dependence. Finally the results obtained with the strain injection techniques by using an unstructured 

coarse mesh are also presented. 

a) b) c) 

   

Figure 12 Finite element meshes; a) structured fine mesh; b) unstructured fine mesh; c) unstructured coarse 

mesh 

Figure 13 compares results obtained with the two finite element formulations (strain injection 

techniques and irreducible formulation) for both fine meshes in Figure 12. Since the Rankine 

constitutive model is the same for both formulations, the differences in Figure 13 can be exclusively 

attributed to the performance of the finite element formulation. 

In fact, the results obtained with the irreducible formulation show a considerably stiffer behavior in 

terms of the post-peak response that can be related to spurious extra energy dissipation due to stress 

locking defects. This issue has also consequences in the peak load which is miss-predicted for the 

irreducible formulation when using the unstructured mesh. Although, for this specific example, the 

differences in terms of the peak load are not too large (less than 10 %), we would like to remark that 

the results obtained with the irreducible formulation are not on the safety side.  

Relatively to the results obtained by using the strain injection techniques and the coarse unstructured 

mesh, it can be observed that the peak load is slightly miss-predicted but the post-peak behavior is 

very well captured, this indicating that similar amount of energy is being dissipated for both (fine and 

course) meshes, this clearly proving the mesh-size objectivity of the obtained results. 



22 

 
Figure 13 Finite element meshes; a) structured mesh; b) unstructured mesh 

It is also remarkable that results obtained by strain injection technique, for both fine meshes, are 

almost the same, which is a strong indicator of mesh independence. This can be noticed either by the 

overlapping curves in Figure 13 or by the near coincident crack trajectories in Figure 14.  

For the coarse unstructured mech. although the results in Figure 14 show some differences in terms of 

the crack trajectories (which are corrected with mesh refinement), this doesn’t translate, as mentioned 

before, into relevant differences in the quantitative structural response (see Figure 13).

Relative to the results obtained by the irreducible formulation, Figure 15 shows different results in 

terms of the crack patterns. This issue is related to the mesh bias influence, since the crack pattern 

obtained for the structured mesh seems to be clearly influenced by horizontal mesh direction.

5.2 Full size concrete gravity dam 

The Koyna Dam in India, whose geometry is depicted in Figure 16, is an example of a full-scale 

concrete gravity dam that can be used for testing new modeling techniques. The crack propagation 

throughout the dam body, under quasi-static conditions, caused by an hypothetical overflow, was first 

studied by Gioia [14] by using linear elastic fracture mechanics. The authors found that a crack 

developing from point B in Figure 16, is the most critical in terms of the ultimate structural resistance 

and, for this reason, an initial imperfection is assigned to that location.

During the numerical simulations, the dam initially undergoes its self-weight and the full reservoir 

hydrostatic pressure, and then, is subjected to a step by step constant pressure increase due to 

overflow. The loading corresponding to the overflow is indirectly applied by using arc-length 

techniques in which the crack mouth opening displacement at point B is controlled. All the 

computations were performed under plane strain conditions.

For assessing the mesh influence in the obtained results two distinct finite element meshes, structured 

and unstructured, are used (Figure 17).  

a) b) 

  
Figure 17 Finite element meshes; a) structured mesh; b) unstructured mesh. 

The analysis of the results are performed in two stages: 

1- First, the results obtained with the injection techniques and both finite element meshes (of 

Figure 17) are compared. 

2- Second, the results obtained with the injection techniques are compared with results obtained 

by using an irreducible finite element formulation. Since in both cases, the constitutive model 

is the same, the eventual enhanced behavior reflects, exclusively, improvements related to the 

finite element formulation. Comparison with other authors’ results is also performed at this 

stage. 

5.2.1 Results obtained with the strain injection techniques

The curves of Figure 18 display minimal differences which is a strong indication of very similar 

structural behavior. For both meshes, point A is a limit point, from where the crack progresses without 

increasing the load (“snap-through”) until point C. After this point, of unstable physical crack 

propagation, the crack still grows but requiring load increase. Figure 19 and Figure 20 show the crack 

propagation evolution at three different stages of the computations (see the points in Figure 18), for 

the unstructured mesh.

Figure 21 compares the results obtained using both meshes in terms of the crack propagation. This 

comparison clearly displays that both solutions are very similar in terms of the crack pattern (see 

Figure 21 c)) which indicates that the results are independent of the mesh alignment. Figure 22 shows 

the deformed configurations for both finite element meshes.

5.2.2 Comparisons with the classic displacement-based finite element formulation  

In Figure 23, results obtained with the proposed techniques are compared with those obtained with the 

displacement-based irreducible formulation and by Gioia [14] using Linear Elastic Fracture 

Mechanics (LEFM).

injection techniques and the irreducible formulation for both meshes of Figure 17: a) Structured mesh; b) 

Unstructured mesh. 

There it can be checked that, due to stress locking effects, the classical formulations overestimate the 

ultimate structural load carrying capacity. This mesh dependent behavior is further noticeable for the 

unstructured mesh, which is consistent with the fact that stress locking effects are, normally, more 



27 

severe for this kind of meshes. In Figure 23 it is also included the result obtained by Gioia (LEFM), 

using a structured mesh under plane strain conditions

.  

Spurious stress locking effects can also be identified by the plot of the equivalent plastic deformation 

in Figure 24. This figure shows that, for the results obtained with the classical formulation, the non-

linear effects spread spuriously, by several elements in the direction orthogonal to the crack. Instead, 

for the results obtained with the strain injection techniques the plastic effects are highly concentrated 

in a one-element-width localization band, this indicating that no spurious stresses are being 

transferred by the open crack.

using the strain injection techniques and the irreducible formulation for both meshes of Figure 17. 

These results clearly display the advantages of the strain injection techniques in front of the classical 

irreducible formulations. In particular, they show that stress locking effects are effectively minimized. 

6 Conclusions 

In this work, the potential of the recently proposed strain injection techniques, so far with applications 

limited to some academic benchmarks, has been explored for studying crack propagation in concrete 

gravity dams. 

The obtained results clearly show the improvements obtained by using the proposed methodology in 

terms of mesh independence, either avoiding mesh bias or stress locking effects. This spurious 

undesirable behavior can lead to unrealistic failure mechanisms or to the overestimation of the 

ultimate structural load carrying capacity. In the Konya simulation, for instance, the displacement 

                                                      

13
 Other authors have studied crack propagation in this dam (cf. [17, 27, 51]) in plane stress conditions. 

Although the obtained results are not too different, a rigorous comparison cannot be performed due to the 

different choice of the plane analysis assumptions, and for this reason, comparisons with those results have been 

skipped in this work. 



28 

based classical formulation delivers results overestimating the structural resistance in about 20 %, 

which is not on the safety side. 

The new methodology has several advantages that the authors would like to remark: 

 Mesh independence of the results. 

 Low computational cost – the explored approach captures the crack inside the finite element, 

which means that coarse meshes can be used when compared with the finer meshes required 

by other methodologies (nonlocal [31, 32, 64], phase field [33, 47], etc.) that use several 

elements across the band for modeling the crack. Moreover, all the additional degrees of 

freedom (related to the enhanced strain modes) are condensed out at the element level. The 

final result is a methodology that keeps the computational cost at the level of the standard 

displacement-based finite element formulations. 

 Nonintrusive numerical implementation in existing finite element codes – The strain-injection 

technique in combination with the crack-path-field technique avoids the code invasive global 

crack tracking algorithms, usually used in association with other intra-elemental approaches 

(E-FEM [58] or X-FEM [65]), with no apparent cost in terms of robustness. This issue is a 

strong advantage, since the implementation tasks, in a non-linear finite element code, affect, 

essentially, the element level. 

 Constitutive model generality – the method affects exclusively the finite element formulation, 

this meaning that, in principle, any continuum constitutive model equipped with strain 

softening can be used within the formulation. 

Due to these important properties, that address the main issues of material failure modeling (mesh 

independence, computational cost, robustness), the strain injection techniques render a methodology 

particularly efficient for modeling tensile crack propagation in concrete dams. Moreover, the results 

obtained in this paper show that the method is ready for being used in practice, allowing improved 

estimation of the structural safety factor and helping in the security control of those gravity concrete 

dams which might be particularly vulnerable to crack propagation.  

The ongoing extension of the presented methodology to 3D cases will open the application field to 

large arch dams.
