Abstract: This paper presents a finite element approach for modelling three-dimensional crack 
propagation in quasi-brittle materials, based on the strain injection and the crack-path field techniques. 

These numerical techniques were already tested and validated by static and dynamic simulations in 2D 

classical benchmarks [1-3] and, also, for modelling tensile crack propagation in real concrete structures, 

like concrete gravity dams [4]. The main advantages of the methodology are the low computational cost 

and the independence of the results on the size and orientation of the finite element mesh. These 

advantages were highlighted in previous works by the authors and motivate the present extension to 3D 

cases. 

The proposed methodology is implemented in the finite element framework using continuum 

constitutive models equipped with strain softening and consists, essentially, in injecting the elements 

candidate to capture the cracks with some goal oriented strain modes for improving the performance of 

the injected elements for simulating propagating displacement discontinuities. The goal-oriented strain 

modes are introduced by resorting to mixed formulations and to the Continuum Strong Discontinuity 

Approach (CSDA), while the crack position inside the finite elements is retrieved by resorting to the 

crack-path field technique.  

Representative numerical simulations in 3D benchmarks show that the advantages of the methodology 

already pointed out in 2D are kept in 3D scenarios. 

1 Introduction 

Computational failure mechanics is a field of research that has attracted significant interest in the last 

decades. The safety of the engineering designs motivates the research in the field. Numerical methods 

that can realistically simulate crack propagation have become relevant tools for modeling failure 

scenarios. They allow a safe and efficient design of new structures, quantification of safety factors of 

the existing ones, in front of non-expected loads, and the assessment of the remaining structural life of 

structures that, due to ageing and degradation of the constituent materials, have lost part of their initial 

load bearing capacity.  



2 

Within the context of the finite element method, the earliest methodologies for modeling propagating 

cracks have shown to provide mesh dependent results [5, 6]. A systematic analysis of the main 

numerical problems arising from these methodologies, stress locking and mesh-bias dependence, was 

first done in [7]. These numerical pathologies have motivated a subsequent huge scientific research on 

the field, and a multiplicity of methods have been proposed and developed by different authors.  

One important family of methods is based on the regularization of standard continua equipped with 

strain-softening. These methodologies incorporate a characteristic length and the discontinuity is 

captured by a band with bandwidth, h, encompassing several finite elements. For this reason, this family 

of methods can be also referred in [2] as supra-element-band methods. Non local [8-10] and gradient-

enriched [11, 12] models, which share some similarities with the more recently proposed phase-field 

models of fracture [13, 14], can be included in this category. 

Another relevant family of methods considers the discontinuity captured inside the finite element. In 

these methodologies, also termed intra-element methods [2] , the finite elements are enriched with 

additional discontinuous displacement modes and they give rise to the E-FEM [15-17] or X-FEM 

techniques [18, 19] when these additional modes have an elemental or nodal support, respectively.  

Despite the huge advances that have been achieved in the last years, most of the existing methods have 

shown limitations for being applied in modelling real life problems, either because the models have 

been implemented only for 2D cases, or because the computational cost of the 3D implementation is 

unaffordable when applied to large structures. In fact, many times they require the use of large-scale, 

parallel, computing equipment, not available to most of the researchers and engineers.  

The remarkable properties of the strain injection techniques in terms of mesh independence and low 

computational cost, pointed out in 2D modelling, either for static[2, 4] and dynamic calculations [3, 

20]1, have motivated the authors to perform the present extension to 3D, in which the applications are 

computationally much more demanding. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to provide evidence 

that the methodology can be extended to three dimensions, while retaining its main advantages, so a 

mesh independent time-affordable methodology, which can be used in a standard personal computer 

for modelling 3D crack propagation and material failure, can be proposed and validated.  

In order to validate the technology, some applications to 3D benchmarks have been performed and 

results are compared with experimental or numerical tests by other authors. Since the goal of the paper 

is focused on the 3D extension, the inertial effects are left aside and the kinematical description of the 

motion is simplified to infinitesimal strains. 

The finite element formulation presented in this work closely follows the formulation derived in the 

previous publication [4], where a mixed stabilized formulation is used for all the domain. In order to 

provide the unfamiliar reader with the main features of the methodology, a brief theoretical summary 

is given in sections 2, 3 and 4, but specific details, that can be consulted in [1-4], are not included for 

the sake of length and avoiding repetition of material already published. 

                                                      

1 For dynamic cases remarkably coarse meshes were used when compared with competing methods, as pointed 
out in [3].

2 Adopted variational 3D approach to the mechanical problem  

Standard finite element formulations of the non-linear mechanical problem (summarized in Box 1) are 

usually displacement-based, in the sense that the displacement field, ( , )txu , is the independent 

unknown to be interpolated by means of suitable interpolation functions. Due to implementation 

reasons, the mechanical formulation will be presented in rate form. 

Given the external actions, * ( , )txu& , * ( , )tt x& and ( , )tb x& , find ( , )txu& , ( , )txe& and ( , )txs& :

are the prescribed displacements, tractions and body loads, respectively. In equation (3) as , e ,  stand, 

respectively for the stresses, the strains and internal variables of the constitutive model. 

Conversely, this work uses the mixed stabilized formulation presented in [4], based on two fields, 

displacements and strains / eu : 

where equations (5)(a) and (5)(b) correspond to weak forms of the equilibrium (1) and compatibility 

(2) equations, respectively, extW& stands for the work rate produced by the external forces and h  and m

for suitable test functions. In comparison with the one-field case, the mixed formulation in equation (5) 

renders a more flexible approach for modelling material failure, since it gives additional freedom in the 

choice of the strain interpolation. 

By choosing standard bi-linear interpolation functions for the displacement field and element-wise 

constant interpolation for the strains, in eight-noded hexahedral finite elements, and adding a consistent 

stabilizing term to the equations, the finite element approximation of equation (5) reads, after some 

mathematical manipulation (see [4]):

stands for the mean value of the symmetric gradient of the displacements over the finite element.  

This mixed formulation is particularly suited for developing the strain injection techniques since the 

strain modes to be injected are also proposed by resorting to mixed / eu  finite element approaches. 

3 Strain injection techniques 

The main idea of the strain injection technique consists of improving the performance of some specific 

elements (belonging to the injection domain, injB ) for modeling strain localization by injecting specific 

enhanced strain modes, while the remaining elements keep using the base formulation (in the present 

work the mixed formulation (6)) typically in the zones where the body behaves elastically (Figure 1).  

Figure 1: Split of the domain into sub-domains: (strain) injected domain, injB , and non-injected 

domain, \ injB B . 

In previous works from the authors for 2D cases [1, 2, 4], two specific strain modes were proposed, 

which will also be used in the present 3D implementation: the constant strain mode (CSM) and the 

discontinuous displacement mode (DDM).  

The CSM will be injected in those elements that initially verify the bifurcation condition ([21]), which, 

therefore, are regarded as “candidates” for developing displacement discontinuities. We would like to 

emphasize that not all of these “candidates” elements, will develop discontinuities at this, or subsequent 

times. In fact as the loading process goes on, strains tend to localize in narrow bands, so the elements 

outside this band will naturally unload, leaving, therefore, the injection domain and recovering the 

mixed finite element formulation (6). On the other hand, those elements where strains remain localizing 

will be reached by the evolving crack path (see section 5), so they will be injected with the discontinuity 

displacement mode (DDM), for enriching their ability to capture accurately the crack opening inside 

the finite elements, without spurious stress transfer to the neighboring elements. Figure 2 illustrates the 

process.

injected with the constant strain mode ( CSMe ) while in dark gray are identified de elements injected with the 

discontinuous displacement mode ( DDMe ). 

The CSM injection is obtained by considering the strains constant inside the finite element. Here it is 

highlighted the convenience of the mixed finite element formulation, since this mode can be activated 

just by considering 
( )et = 0  in equation (6), which renders:

This injection will be applied as soon as the bifurcation condition has been fulfilled in the centroid of 

the finite element, at time ( )( )eB Ct t³ x  (where Bt  is the bifurcation time) and as long as the element

The DDM injection was inspired by the strong discontinuity kinematics [16] and allows modeling the 

crack opening behavior inside the finite elements without stress locking defects. After some 

manipulations that can be consulted in previous works of the authors [1, 2], the discontinuous 

displacement mode can be written as:

displacement jump inside the finite element, ( )j x  is a continuous indicator function (see [1, 2]), taking 

values of 0 or 1 for each side of the discontinuity, dS  is the Dirac distribution shifted to S and k is the 
(small) regularization parameter, used, for computational purposes, to regularize the Dirac’s 
generalized function and standing for the bandwidth of the band capturing the jump. The regularizing 
parameter, k, can be defined as a fraction of the elemental effective bandwidth ( )el  computed as:

1- The elements are crossed by the discontinuity path tG . In order to inject the DDM, the 

progression of the actual discontinuity path should be identified a little in advance. In the context 

of the strain injection techniques this is obtained by the crack path field technique described in 

Section 4. 

2- The barycenter of the finite element has achieved a “sufficient” degree of softening. This is 

imposed in terms of the stress-like internal variable ( )( , )eCq tx , as following: 

( ) ( )( , ) ( )e ebifC Cq t qx xg£  (11) 

where 
( )( )ebif Cq x  is the value of internal variable at the bifurcation time and g is a user-parameter 

defining the injection threshold (typically [ . , . ]g Î 0 9 1 0 ).  

REMARK 3-1 The methodology used in this work is a combination of the strain injection 

and the crack path field techniques in Section 4. In fact, for effectively injecting the DDM, 

the crack path should be identified in advance. For ensuring that the crack path is well 
captured a delay between the DDM injection and the bifurcation time has to be considered. 

The user-defined parameter g in equation (11) plays this role, safeguarding that a 

“sufficient” degree of softening was achieved prior to the injection. From the author’s 

experience, g = 0.95  provides a good balance between the (little) error produced by delaying 

the injection and the need of having reliable information from the crack-path field 

technique prior to that injection. 

4 Crack-path field technique 

The crack-path field technique allows tracing the discontinuity path, G  (see Figure 3), in terms of the 

strain localization pattern that arises, naturally, by introducing softening in the constitutive relations 

between stresses and strains. The intuitive idea for predicting the position of the discontinuity is to 

compute the relative maxima of a, conveniently chosen, localizing field. In this work, we chose to use 

for such purpose the strain like internal variable ha  of the continuum constitutive model (Figure 3). In 

practice, the locus of relative maxima of the localizing field can be computed by means of the zero 

level-set of its normal directional derivative (see Figure 4).

is computed at the domain nodes, the exact position of the crack path thought the element can be easily 

retrieved in an element basis, in terms of its nodal values (Figure 5). 

Figure 5: Retrieving the elemental positon of the crack from the nodal crack-path-field values: sign 

changing from positive, ( im

- ), identifies that the elemental edge , ( i j- ), is crossed by the 

crack (the crossing point is identified for ( )m =x 0  assuming a linear evolution the edge). Potential situations 

for linear hexahedral elements are sketched in the figure. 

5 Representative numerical simulations 

In order to asses the performance of the strain injection and the crack-path field techniques proposed in 

this work, a number of representative simulations of 3D propagating cracking in quasi-brittle materials 

are presented in the following sections.  

5.1 Homogeneous strip subjected to tensile stretching using a scalar isotropic 

damage model 

The homogeneous strip subjected to tensile stretching sketched in Figure 6 is analyzed first. The value 

of this simple problem comes from the fact that an exact analytical solution is available, so the results 

provided by the numerical simulation can be rigorously compared to an exact solution. This example 

was already analyzed by the authors in a previous work [2] in 2D (where the strip was idealized in 2D 

plane strain conditions), and is used here as a first step for validating the 3D implementation. 

 

Figure 6: Homogeneous strip subjected to tensile stretching. Geometry (m) and material parameters, being 

us  the ultimate stress, E the Young’s modulus, n  the Poisson’s ratio, fG  the fracture energy and g is the 

user-parameter defining the DDM injection threshold (see REMARK 3-1). 

The theoretical solution for this quasi-homogeneous problem, when using a scalar isotropic damage 

model (slightly perturbed at some point to break the initial homogeneity) with null Poisson ratio, 

consists of a vertical crack passing through the perturbed point. In order to challenge the methodology,

a miss-oriented mesh of 8-node hexahedral finite elements was used to perform the numerical tests, as 

shown in Figure 7, where results obtained with the standard displacement based formulation and the 

strain injection techniques are plotted. As it can be observed, the results obtained with the standard 

formulation are clearly affected by the mesh bias, since the localization band follows de mesh alignment 

and a spurious tangential displacement jump is obtained. On the other hand, when using the strain 

injection techniques the localization band “zigzags” through the mesh and, in spite of the challenge 

posed by the mesh bias, a vertical crack pattern is obtained consisting in a crack opening in mode I of 

fracture (with zero tangential displacement jump) (see Figure 8). These results, along with the force 

displacement curves depicted in Figure 9, provide strong evidence of the advantages and accuracy of 

the strain injection techniques for modeling crack propagation in 3D problems.

5.2 Four-point bending test  

The classic four-point bending test of a concrete beam, reported by Arrea and Ingraffea [22], and used 

as a benchmark by various authors (e.g. [7, 23-26]), is now considered by using a Rankine-type 

plasticity model (Figure 11). Likewise for the homogeneous strip example of Section 5.1, this example 

was previously analysed by the authors in [2] (where the 3D geometry was simplified to ideal 2D plane 

stress conditions). Here it is used as second validation step of the 3D implementation, now by 

considering a bending beam. 

The results reported by using physical experiments, consist of a curved fracture propagating from the 

notch tip, as it is depicted in Figure 11. The numerical analysis was carried out by controlling the Crack 

Mouth Sliding Displacement (CMSD) at the notch.

Figure 12 shows some results obtained with the strain injection techniques using an unstructured mesh. 

It can be observed that the crack trajectory compares well with the experimental result. The plot of the 

iso-displacement contours along with the deformed mesh shows the sharpness of the strain localization 

band, that encompasses just one finite element, this indicating that stress-locking effects are effectively 

circumvented.

For a quantitative comparison, the force-displacement curves obtained by using the strain injection 

techniques and the standard displacement based finite element formulation are plotted in Figure 15. In 

the figure the experimental envelop provided in [22] (shaded zone) is also depicted. The plot shows that 

the results obtained with the standard formulation are much more dissipative (area below de curve) than 

the ones obtained by the strain injection, that fit well in the experimental envelop. This fact gives 

additional evidence that stress locking is effectively minimized by the proposed injection techniques.

REMARK 5-1. It is known in the Continuum Strong Discontinuity Approach that when 

strong discontinuities are used with Rankine-type plasticity models, the so-called strong 

discontinuity conditions place restrictions on the displacement jump [27], that has to 

evolve in pure mode I (without tangential component). In case of curved cracks these 

conditions constrain the crack to evolve because cracks in pure mode I have to 

propagate in a straight path. This incompatibility was analysed in [2] and termed as 

kinematic locking. In order to alleviate this kinematic restriction, the regularization 

parameter k, of equation (10), was set, for this example, equal to the element size ( )el , 

this allowing a mixed mode compatible with the curved crack to propagate without 

locking effects. 

5.3 Pull-out test 

This example consists of the numerical simulation of the pullout of a steel anchor embedded in a 

concrete block. Pullout tests have been investigated, either numerically or experimentally, by diverse 

authors using a variety of experimental setups. The first numerical studies have been performed in two 

dimensions using axisymmetric plane finite elements [7, 28, 29] and also lattice elements [30].  

More recently, these problems had started to be used as a benchmark for testing new methodologies 

aiming at modelling crack propagation in three dimensions [31-35]. Here, in order to have data for 

comparison, we choose the geometry considered in [7, 31-35], consisting of a 40 mm thick steel disc, 

with radius equal to 200 mm, and a concrete cylindrical block with radius and thickness of 700 mm and 

600 mm, respectively.  

As shown in Figure 16, the problem is axis-symmetric, so by applying symmetry conditions in the 

lateral vertical faces just a quarter of the specimen needs to be modeled. The anchor bolt was not 

explicitly modeled in the simulation, so the vertical load F was applied directly in the steel disc, being 

the concrete block pulled against a counter-pressure ring placed on the superior surface of the block and 

fixed in the vertical direction. The steel disc was assumed connected to the concrete only at top face, 

whereas no contact has been assumed along the bottom and lateral surfaces.  

The numerical analysis was held by using arch-length techniques so eventual snap-backs exhibited by 

the response can be traced.

Young’s modulus, n  the Poisson’s ratio, fG  the fracture energy and g is the user-parameter defining the 

DDM injection threshold (see REMARK 3-1). 

In the analysis presented in [7] the author identified two different mechanisms of failure: i) a splitting 

mode and ii) a conical pull-out failure mode. Here we are interested in simulating the conical pull-out 

failure where the crack propagates from the upper circular edge of the steel disk into the concrete block 

towards the counter-pressure ring. 

Figure 17 shows the evolution of the pull-out failure mechanism simulated by using the strain injection 

techniques and a Rankine plasticity constitutive model, for three representative stages of analysis.

In Figures 18 and 19 the results obtained with the strain injection techniques are compared with those 

computed with the standard displacement-based finite element formulation. In Figure 18, a quantitative 

comparison, in terms of the force displacement curves, is presented, while in Figure 19 the equivalent 

plastic deformations at the final stages of analysis are plotted, this allowing to compare qualitatively 

the distribution of the non-linear effects. This latter figure shows that the results obtained using a 

standard displacement-based finite element formulation, suffer from severe stress locking and the pull-

out failure mechanism does not evolve. In contrast, it can be observed that, by using the strain injection 

techniques. The conical pull-out mechanism is formed and that the non-linear phenomena concentrate

in a band encompassing just one finite element, this indicating that stress locking effects are much 

circumvented [36].

In Figure 21 the results obtained with the strain injection techniques are compared with results obtained 

by other authors. In terms of the crack trajectory of the pull out mechanism the various solutions are 

quite similar, i.e. the crack propagates from the upper circular edge of the steel disk at the bottom of the 

concrete block towards the counter pressure ring.

As for the quantitative results (force-displacement curves in Figure 21) some relevant differences are 

found. In fact, the solutions provided in [32] (using X-FEM) and [33] (using stabilized mixed 

formulations) are more stiffer throughout the loading process. On the contrary, the results in [31], using 

a partition of unity method (PUM), and the ones obtained with the techniques proposed in this work, 

both using the concept of “embedded discontinuities”, display a more flexible response and both lead

softening is the one obtained with the strain injection techniques proposed in this work. 

5.4 Brokenshire torsion test 

This torsion test was proposed by Brokenshire [37] for the experimental study of fracture torsion and 

consists of a prismatic concrete beam with a notch inclined by 45º in relation to the top and down 

surfaces. The experimental setup used by Brokenshire is depicted in Figure 22, where it is shown that 

the beam is restrained by two steel frames at both ends, being supported at three corners and loaded at 

the fourth corner, this generating the torsional moment.  

The Brokenshire torsion test has attracted large attention from the computational mechanics community 

[38-46] since the experimentally reported results, consisting of a nonplanar curved crack trajectory 

(Figure 23), are challenging for those numerical methods aiming to simulate 3D nonplanar crack 

propagation. Here we are presenting some numerical results obtaining by using the strain injection 

techniques and a Rankine plasticity model. Again, as for the four-point bending test in section 5.2, for 

releasing the kinematic locking, that arises when Rankine-type plasticity models and strong 

discontinuities are used, the regularization parameter k, in equation (10), was set equal to the elemental 

effective bandwidth ( )el  (see REMARK 5-1).

In Figure 24 the finite element mesh used in the simulations and a curve displaying the applied force 

versus the Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD), between points A and B (of Figure 22-a). are 

depicted. In turn, Figure 25 shows the evolution of the injection domain, at the front surface, for three 

representative stages of loading (which are signaled in Figure 24-b), while Figure 26 shows a three 

dimensional view of the evolution of the crack path at the same stages of loading. In this latter figure it 

can be appreciated a nonplanar curved crack, propagating downwards from the notch tip, that compares 

well with the experimentally reported results (shown in Figure 23). The crack rotation in the horizontal 

plane can be better appreciated in Figure 27, which shows a top view of the crack path. In Figure 28 are 

shown the iso-surfaces of equivalent plastic deformation and an amplified deformed mesh. In these 

figures, it can be observed that the non-linear phenomena and the displacement jump are captured in a 

sharp band encompassing just one finite element.

In Figure 29 the force-displacement curves obtained with the strain injection techniques are compared 

with the ones obtained experimentally by Brokenshire. These comparisons involve the applied force 

versus the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and also the applied force versus the crack 

mouth sliding displacement (CMSD). It is observed that the strain injection solution captures well the 

limit load as well as the post-limit behavior.

6 Conclusions 

This paper presents a natural extension to real-life three dimensional cases of the crack path field and 

strain injection techniques, that have been proposed by the authors in previous publications and assessed 

in ideal 2D problems [1-4]. The numerical benchmarks clearly show the applicability of the proposed 

techniques for modeling complex crack trajectories in three dimensions.  

The advantages of the methodology, pointed in previous publications, are retained by the present three-

dimensional implementation. In this sense, from this work it might be concluded the following for the 

3D version of the proposed approach: 

 As shown in section 5, where representative numerical applications were presented, coarse 
finite element meshes can be used. Besides, the additional degrees of freedom, for injecting the 

discontinuous modes, are condensed out at the element level, this meaning that the 

computational cost of the methodology remains almost the same than using standard 

displacement-based finite element formulations.  

 The obtained results also provided evidence that stress-locking effects are much minimized and 
that the three-dimensional crack trajectories are independent of the mesh directions, so that 

mesh-bias effects are removed.  

 In this work, either isotropic damage or a Rankine plasticity have been used to model the 
fracturing material, but the techniques can be immediately extended to other continuum 

constitutive models exhibiting strain-softening.  

The proposed strain injection techniques can be regarded as a mesh independent time-affordable 

methodology for modelling 3D crack propagation, which can be used in standard personal computers. 

The authors think that it can be competitive in front of alternative methodologies, both in terms of 

accuracy of the obtained results and response-time of the numerical computations. As an illustration, 

the most relevant computational issues (including the computational cost) involved in the resolution of 

the 3D examples presented in this paper are presented in Table 1Table 1: Relevant computational 

features in 3D problems. M. The used coarse meshes required by the proposed approach, translate into 

very affordable computational times in a regular desktop.
