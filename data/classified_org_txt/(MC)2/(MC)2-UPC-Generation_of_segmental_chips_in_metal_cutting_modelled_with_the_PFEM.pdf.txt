Abstract The Particle Finite Element Method, a lagrangian
finite element method based on a continuous Delaunay re-
triangulation of the domain, is used to study machining of
Ti6Al4V. In this work the method is revised and applied to
study the influence of the cutting speed on the cutting force
and the chip formation process. A parametric methodology
for the detection and treatment of the rigid tool contact is
presented. The adaptive insertion and removal of particles
are developed and employed in order to sidestep the diffi-
culties associated with mesh distortion, shear localization as
well as for resolving the fine-scale features of the solution.
The performance of PFEM is studied with a set of different
two-dimensional orthogonal cutting tests. It is shown that,
despite its Lagrangian nature, the proposed combined finite
element-particle method is well suited for large deformation
metal cutting problems with continuous chip and serrated
chip formation.

1 Introduction

The development of a new machining process requires con-
siderable investment of time and resources. Precise knowl-
edge of the optimal cutting conditions is essential for a timely
start-up. Process characteristics such as the tool geometry
and cutting speed directly influence chipmorphology, cutting
forces, final product dimensionality and tool life. Computer
simulations of the cutting processes can potentially reduce
the number of design iterations and result in substantial cost
savings.

The studyofmetal cutting is difficult froman experimental
point of view, experiments are difficult to carry out. Among
the reasons there are the high speed at which the cut takes
place under industrial machining conditions and the small
scale of the phenomena which are to be observed. Further-
more, the continuous development of tool and work piece
materials and the continuous development of tool geometries
makes the testing a laborious and hard task.

The chip formation process in cutting is difficult to analyze
using analytical methods, due to that, finite element model-
ing (FEM) has frequently been used to study the process
of chip formation at high cutting speeds, see for example
[12,18,25,31]. Numerical modeling of machining processes
is continuously attracting researchers for better understand-
ing of chip formation processes, the heat generation in cutting
zone, tool-chip inter facial frictional characteristics and qual-
ity of the machined surfaces. Finite element simulations
allow studying the cutting process in greater detail than possi-
ble in experiments. In the modeling of machining processes,
the workpiece material is highly deformed due to the cutting.

Comput Mech

In a Lagrangian analysis, this deformation produces a large
mesh distortion. Element distortion has been always matter
of concern which limited the analysis to incipient chip for-
mation in some studies. Standard Lagrangian approaches
such as FEM cannot resolve the large deformations very
well. Instead, FEM with an Eulerian formulation requires
the knowledge of the chip geometry in advance and the mesh
is fixed in the space, that, undoubtedly, restricts the range
of cutting conditions capable of being analyzed. Therefore,
modelingmetal cutting processes becomes amajor challenge
for the finite element method (FEM).

Themain demanding task is relatedwith themodeling and
simulation of large configuration changes. Numerical simu-
lations of cutting process involves angular distortions and
large strains, generation of new boundaries, multiple con-
tacts and self-contact, and fracture with multiple cracks. All
of them are difficult to manage using standard FEM. The
main objective of this paper is specifically to contribute to the
solution of some of the problems described above through the
application of the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM)
to the solution of metal cutting processes including the gen-
eration of continuous but also segmented chips.

1.1 Contents

The paper starts with the description of the problem (see
Sect. 2), explaining which elements come into play in
the numerical simulation and complex physical phenomena
occur which during chip formation.

In Sect. 3 the coupled thermo-mechanical problem equa-
tions are presented in a summarized form of the initial
boundary value problem (IBVP). The equations are writ-
ten using the weak form of the problem and particularized
with the mixed displacement-pressure formulation which
prompted the use of stabilization.

In Sect. 4 we describe the contact phenomena at the
workpiece-tool interface with a rigid tool contact. In Sect. 5
we present an overview of the thermo-elastoplastic models
at finite strains and its stress-update algorithm.

Details of the implicit solution of the Lagrangian FEM
equations in time using an updated Lagrangian approach
and a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme are presented in
Sect. 6.

Then, in Sect. 7, the basic general steps of the PFEM
and the custom characteristics of the present formulation are
explained.

From the model explained in Sect. 5.2 a set of examples
are analyzed in Sect. 8 in order to test the capabilities of the
present formulation for predicting the transition from con-
tinuous to serrated chip formation when an increase of the
cutting speed is applied.

2 Problem statement

In this section, the complex physical phenomena that occur
during chip formation and the numerical model developed
within this work is described.

2.1 Description of the physical problem

High speed machining has a lot of advantages in comparison
with traditionalmachining.Theproductivity canbe improved
by increasingmaterial removal rate, decreasing cutting forces
and enhancing surface quality. Complex physical phenomena
occur during chip formation, such as adiabatic shearing bands
formation.Thermal softeningof thematerial in the shear zone
leads to an increase of the deformation in this zone, which
produces heat and leads to further softening. This positive
feedback between softening and deformation causes a narrow
band (adiabatic shear band) of extremely large deformation,
while the surrounding material is only slightly deformed.
For this process to be plausible, the thermal softening must
be larger than strain and strain rate hardening, so that the
effective stress-strain curve of a material point inside the
shear localized region has a maximum. The cutting speed
must be high enough so that heat conduction out of the shear
zone is small or negligible.

In this work we present the segmental chip formation,
which segmentation is solely caused by the described mech-
anismof adiabatic shearing. Inmany applications,machining
is one of the main cost-determining factors, especially when
hard-to-machine alloys like the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V have
to be cut. Due to the fact that titanium is a poor thermal
conductor, titanium alloys form segmented chips, where the
deformation of the chip is inhomogeneous and regions of
large and small deformation alternate, leading to a serrated
back side of the chip. Large deformations and changes in
geometry occurring during chip formation and segmenta-
tion make the numerical simulations of machining a big
challenge. The main objective of this work is precisely to
contribute to solve some of the problems described above
through the use of the Particle Finite Element Method
(PFEM) and its main ingredients: (1) continuous Delaunay
triangulation and (2) insertion and removal of particles.

2.2 Description of the numerical model

The model of unsteady chip formation that will be analyzed
in this work is shown in Fig. 1. It represents a linear cut-
ting test with some particular characteristics. To simplify the
process complexity, the tool is considered rigid and will be
defined in a parametricway, having a rake angle, a flank angle
and a tool radius. The process is studied using a reduced
two-dimensional model, which strongly improves the com-
putational times and gives a clearer representation of the

resultant thermo-mechanical response. The cutting tool is
moved at a constant speed from the right to the left. The
width of the cutting edge is larger than that of the work piece
and it extends on both sides of the work piece. The work
piece material is considered as homogeneous, isotropic and
initially unstressed. Also, thework piece acceleration and the
induced anisotropy are neglected. The motion of the left and
lower parts of the work piece are restricted in the horizontal
and vertical directions. Cutting begins at time t = 0. Build
up of the workpiece on the tool and subsequent growth of
the chip is to be simulated in real time. The model accounts
for heat conduction, heat generation through plastic work
dissipation and workpiece-tool contact neglecting friction.
The modeling used in this work is able to predict the transi-
tion between continuous and serrated chip formation when
increasing the cutting speed, this happens due to adiabatic
shearing experienced by the material. Material separation in
front of the tool has been modeled by considering the chip
formation process as pure deformation where material flows
visco-plastically around the tool tip.

3 Equation of motion, thermal effects and balance
of mass

A solid domain containing a deformable material which
evolves in time due to the external and internal forces is
considered. Displacements and thermal conditions from an
initial configuration at time t = 0 to a current configuration
at time t = tn are prescribed in some parts of the present
domain. The volume V and its boundaries � at the initial and
current configurations are denoted as (V0, �0) and (Vn, �n),
respectively. The aim is to find the spatial configuration that
thematerial is going to occupy at time t = tn+�t , and, at the
same time, obtain displacements, strains, and stresses in the
updated configuration. In the present work, we will choose
simple 3-noded linear triangle to discretize the displacement,
the pressure and the temperature fields (PFEM requirement).
Higher order elements can also be used, see [32].

3.1 Balance of momentum

tensor and p is the pressure, bi are the external body forces
and t

field and wi are the space weighting functions for the dis-
placement field.

Upon discretization of (1) with finite elements the gov-
erning equations become

of the shape functions used in the interpolation of the problem
variables.

3.2 Thermal balance

In applications such as metal cutting, substantial amount of
heat may be generated due to the plastic working of the
solid. Temperatures attained can be quite high and have a
considerable influence on the mechanical response. The rel-
evant balance law, in this case, is the first law which can be
expressed in weak form as

functions for the temperature. The rate of heat supply due to
the plastic deformation in the bulk is estimated as

Q = βẆ p (6)

123

where Ẇ p is the plastic power per unite of deformed volume
and β the Taylor-Quinney coefficient. Inserting the finite ele-
ment interpolation into (5) results in the semi-discrete system
of equations

Fθ,dyn(θ̇) − Fθ,int (θ) + Fθ,ext = 0 (7)

where Bθ is the global gradient-temperature matrix respec-
tively. The Bθ matrix contains the derivatives of the shape
functions used in the interpolation of the temperature field.

ABackward Euler method is used to discretize (7) in time,
with the result

Fθ,dyn(θ̇n+1) − Fθ,int (θn+1) + Fθ,ext = 0 (11)

where

θ̇n+1 =

The mass conservation equation can be expressed in weak
form as

where J is the determinant of the deformation gradient, α
is the thermal expansion coefficient, θ0 is the temperature of
the solid at the beginning of the cutting processes and κ is the
incompressibility modulus. q represents the space weighting
functions for the pressure.

Upon discretization with finite elements, the incompress-
ibility balance equations (13) are written as

Fp,pres(p) − Fp,vol(u) = 0 (14)

where

Fp,pres(p) =

In finite element computations, the force vectors presented in
Eqs. 2, 11 and 14, are obtained as the assemblies of element
vectors. In this work, the element force vectors are evaluated
using Gaussian quadratures.

3.3.1 Stabilization of the mixed displacement-pressure
equation

The selected discretization (linear elements for displacement
and pressure) is known to lead to spurious oscillations in the
pressure field and a stabilization procedure is required. For
this purpose, the stabilized formulation called the Polyno-
mial Pressure Projection (PPP) presented and applied to the
Stokes equations in [8] is used. The PPP introduces a pressure
term in the mass conservation equation. Unlike other stabi-
lization methods, the Polynomial pressure projection (PPP)
does not require specification of a mesh dependent stabi-
lization parameter or calculation of higher-order derivatives.
The PPP uses a projection on a discontinuous space and as a
consequence can be implemented in an elementary level sur-
passing the need of mesh dependent and problem dependent
parameters. Using the PPP stabilization strategy, the balance
of mass is re-written as

Fp,pres(p) − Fp,vol(u) + Fp,stab(p) = 0 (17)

where

Fp,stab(p) =

and Ñ(e) contain the set of polynomials of order 0, μ is the
shear modulus and αs a parameter that takes the value 1.
More details about the implementation of the PPP strategy
are found in [19–22].

4 Contact

4.1 Rigid tool contact

The approach followed in this work to take into account the
interaction between a cutter and a workpiece is to consider
the tool as a rigid element and the workpiece as deformable
body. If the cutter is rigid, the geometry of that element is not
going to change during the contact. A simple way to define
a fixed geometry is using the mathematical description of
its boundary. That allows us to avoid the drawbacks coming

123



Comput Mech

from the treatment of contact between finite elements or a
boundary with described by a mesh of finite elements.

When contact between finite elements is considered, the
mechanics turns to something numerically more complex. A
geometrical contact search is required and a special master-
slave structure is needed to solver the contact interaction. If
the tool surface is discretized with standard finite elements,
there is no continuity from one element to another. There-
fore the discrete interface gives a non-smooth contact force
profile. The lack of continuity degrades the convergence of
the solution.

In order to obtain a good definition of the contact forces a
good characterization of the contacting geometry is needed.
This is done using a parametrization of the tool surface. Once
an active set of contacts are determined, the mathematical
description of the contact constraint is included in the linear
momentum balance equation.

4.1.1 Parametrization of the contact tool surface

The geometrical scheme considered to describe a cutting tool
can be characterized with three parameters: the tip radius, the
angle of the rake face (rake angle) and the angle of the flank
face (flank angle) (see Fig. 2). Defining these three parame-
ters a circle (or a cylinder in 3D) and twoplanes tangent to that
circle are mathematically determined. For the contact detec-
tion, one must also define the exterior side and the interior
size of the tool. When a particle of the deformable domain
is going to exceed the described contour that particle will
be in contact with the tool. The geometrical contact defini-
tion is performed by any particle of the workpiece boundary.
The contact parameters will be defined by the contact zone
where a particle is going to interact with. Taking into account
the characteristics of the parametrization, these zones can be
classified as the rake, the tip and the flank side of the cutting
tool (see Fig. 2). The spatial zones are determined by the
intersection of geometrical areas defined by the subgroups

shown in Fig. 3. Each subgroup is defined geometrically
using the projection of auxiliary vectors coming from the
geometrical characterization of the tool parametrization.

4.1.2 Normal contact contribution

The definition of the outward normal directionnwill be given
by the mathematical equation characterizing the rigid tool
surface.A boundaryworkpiece particle contacting to the rake
of flank areas will got the normal of that planes. In the case
of a particle contacting with the tip contour the normal will
be characterized by the segment joining the particle with the
tool center. Once a particle enters in contact with one of the
tool surfaces the normal gap gN will be computed projecting
the exceeding distance vector into the corresponding normal.
Using a penalty approach, the constitutive equation for the
normal force PN is given by

PN = κgN (19)

where the κ is the penalty parameter. Note that κ must be
proportional to the contributive surface area of the particle
entering in contact in order to ensure that the finite elements
pass the patch test. The contact constraint contribution for
the weak form of the linear momentum equation is given by

∫
�cont

wi PN ni d�cont = PNn (20)

n is the normal to the contact surface.

In this section, the formulation of the constitutive thermo-
plasticitymodel at finite strains will be summarized. In Box 1

Comput Mech

Fig. 3 Geometrical contact search based on the definition of spatial rigid tool contact zones

we present the main equations of the thermo-mechanical J2
flow model for rate dependent plasticity that will be used
in this work. Details of the theory of thermo-plasticity as
well the definition of the variables that appear in Box 1 are
explained see [19–21,29]. In this model, we assume that the
deformation gradientF admit amultiplicative decomposition
in elastic and plastic parts, F = FeFp, respectively. The elas-
tic response is expressed in terms of be = FeFeT , whereFe is
the elastic left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. The elas-
tic response of the material is modeled using a hyperelastic
Neo-Hookean model [3,27].

The implicit Backward-Euler method is the most com-
monly used integration scheme for plasticity (see [27,28,30])
and it is the integration scheme adopted in this work.
Other integration schemes are available in the literature see
[13,15,21]. Box 2 shows themain steps involved in the radial
return mapping algorithm to solve the J2 plasticity model
presented in Box 1.

5.2 Isotropic Hardening law

In a typical machining event, very high strain rates in excess
of 1 ·107 s−1 may be attained within the primary shear zone,
while the remainder of the workpiece deforms at moderate

or low strain rates. A simple model which accounts for this
behavior is described in the following lines.

As it is the intent of this paper to show that PFEM is able
to predict the main effects of the cutting speed on chip for-
mation, a rather simple, generic flow stress law has been used
as is described in the material model presented by Bäker in
[1]. The isothermal flow stress (σy + β) used in this paper is
given by

where K and n are temperature-dependent material param-
eters, ˙̄e0 the reference strain rate and C is a constant. More
detail can be found in [1].

K ∗, n∗, θMT and μ are material properties see([1]). Val-
ues for these parameters and thermophysical data are listed
in Tables 1 and 2. It should be noted that this flow stress
law should only be considered as an approximation to the
real material due to the large extrapolations necessary. The
extrapolation is necessary because the split-Hopkinson bar
apparatus allows to characterize the material at strain rates of
up to 1 · 104 s−1 at different temperatures but in high speed
machining, the strain rates over 1 · 107 s−1 are reached.

6 Thermo-mechanical coupling

The following lines present a summaryof the isothermal split,
developed in [29]. Let tn → tn+1 be the initial and final time
step. Let �t = tn+1 − tn be the time increment.

The algorithm in Box 3 is based on the application of an
implicit backward-Euler difference scheme to the momen-
tum equation, for fixed initial temperature (temperature
at previous time step) and the application of an implicit
backward-Euler difference scheme to the energy equation
at a fixed configuration (configuration obtained as a solution
of the mechanical problem).

The solution of the balance of momentum equation for
fixed initial temperature gives an update of the primary vari-
ables un+1, pn+1 and a first update of the internal variables
(left Cauchy-Green tensor, internal energy and entropy) of
the form

In summary, the isothermal split solves the mechanical
problem with a predicted value of temperature equal to the
temperature of the last converged time step and, then, solves
the thermal problem using the configuration obtained as a
solution of the mechanical problem. A full Newton-Raphson
scheme is used for the solution of the non-linear system;
the necessary linearization of the constitutive law has been
presented in see [21,29]. The details of the linearization of
the weak form of the momentum and energy equation can be

7 The Particle Finite Element Method

The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) was developed
initially for solving fluid dynamics problems. The method
was presented as a novel way to model free surfaces in a
Lagrangian manner, following and tracking the fluid parti-
cles along the domain (see [11]). The Lagrangian description
of the continuum, commonly used in the field of solids,
allowed the possibility of the modeling of fluid dynamics
and the treatment of the fluid-structure interaction problems
in a unified manner. A wide range of simulations has been
facedwith PFEMsince it was first presented: fluid interacting
with rigid bodies, used in marine and port engineering; ero-
sion processes, used in river engineering, mixing processes
or fluid coupling with thermal effects, industrial granular
flows; trying to give a response to many industrial problems
[10,16,17].

In this paper we apply the method to the modeling of
industrial metal cutting processes, concentrating our efforts
on the modeling of segmental chip formation in the cut.
The Lagrangian description of the continuum is something
common within the theory of solids for the Finite Element
Method. However finite elements have some critical limita-
tions when they deform too much and its shape is distorted.
That occurs when the material suffers large strains as is
the case of the concerning problem. The role of the parti-
cle description of domain is to introduce a solution for this
matter.

The definition of the variables that appear in this box are explained in Sects. 3 and 5 and references [21,30].

The original idea of the PFEM was to improve the
mesh quality by performing a re-tessellation of the domain.
This must be used only when is needed and localized to
the regions with critical distortion. That allows to adapt
to the large changes of the meshing domain and avoid
global remeshing and interpolation from mesh to mesh
at each computing step. In 2D, the re-tessellation con-
sists in re-computing the element connectivity using a
Delaunay triangulation [6,26] where the current position
of the particles (i.e., of the mesh nodes) is kept fixed.
Mesh distortion is corrected and improved naturally with
the PFEM, because the triangulation maximize the mini-
mum angle of all the angles of the triangles of the new
mesh. Therefore it tends to avoid distorted skinny trian-
gles.

First applications of the PFEM to solid mechanics were
done in problems involving large strains, large rotations,
multi-body contacts and creation of new surfaces (riv-
eting, powder filling and machining,shearing) [14,19,20,
22–24]. In this work, we extended the Particle Finite
Element Method to the numerical simulation of metal

cutting processes involving the transition from continu-
ous to serrated chip with the increment of the cutting
speed.

7.1 Basic steps of the PFEM

The PFEM is characterized by the particle description of the
material domain. A cloud ofmaterial particles are considered
to define the continuum domain. A Lagrangian description
of the analysis domain is used to define the particles motion
which is tracked during the transient solution. An incremen-
tal update of the body configuration is done at each time step
with the use of theUpdatedLagrangian formulation.The con-
tinuum equations are solved with the FEM. Hence a mesh of
FE must be generated with the re-connection of the mate-
rial particles discretizing the continuum. The quality of the
numerical solution improves with the discretization, so the
number and the location of the material particles is going to
improve the problem resolution. Adaptive mesh refinement
techniques will be used to improve the resultant particle dis-
tribution.

123



Comput Mech

For clarity purposes the steps of typical solution with
the PFEM are described next. The starting point is a col-
lection or cloud of nodes (C) pertaining to the analysis
domain. The volume (V) of the analysis domain is defined
by the contours of that cloud of nodes. A mesh (M) dis-
cretizing the domain is obtained by the re-connection of the
nodes. An example of the remeshing scheme using PFEM
is shown in Fig. 4. The solution involves the following
steps:

1. Definition of the domain(s)�n in the last converged con-
figuration, t = tn , keeping existing spatial discretization
�̄n .

2. Discretization of the given domain(s) in a set of particles
of infinitesimal size elimination of existing connectivities
�̄n .

3. Reconstruction of the mesh through a triangulation of the
domains convex-hull and the definition of the boundary
applying the α-shape method [9], defining a new spatial
discretization.

4. A contact method to recognize themultibody interaction.
5. Solution of the system of equations for tn+1 = tn + �t .
6. Go back to step 1 and repeat the solution process for the

next time step.

The transference of elemental variables that is a critical
aspect in solids but less in fluids is usually performed by
a smoothing process. This process consists in transfer the
information of Gauss points to nodes (particles) before the
elimination of the existing elements connectivity (step 2) and
recover the information with the interpolation of the nodal
variables into Gauss points before to perform the solution of
the system equations (step 5). The improved transfer of ele-
mental information used in this work is going to be described
in detail in Sect. 7.2.

Although we are not going to make use of this aspect in
our modeling, highlight that with this description is easy to
model separation of particles from the main domain such as
fracture of the chip in metal cutting problems. In the case
of individual particles segregation, their isolated motion is
determined taking into account that a particle has a known
density, a known initial acceleration and velocity, and is sub-
jected to gravity forces.

7.2 Meshing procedure and variables transfer in the
PFEM

The meshing procedure is a process of crucial importance in
a typical solution with the PFEM. The continuous remesh-

Comput Mech

ing is performed via Delaunay triangulation which build a
discretized domain with certain particular properties. The
Delaunay tessellation generates the convex figure of mini-
mum area that encloses all the points of the domain. The
resultant mesh may be not conformal with the external
boundaries of the solid domain. If the external boundaries
are not preserved the conservation of volume of the domain
is not necessarily fulfilled. This is a relevant weakness of
the method which is not a valid solution for solid mechanics
problems.

In fluids, the tracking of the boundaries (free surfaces) is
a part of the method capabilities and the boundary recogni-
tion problem is overcome with the so-called α-shape method
[9]. With the α-shape method one can consider that an
element of the convex hull conforms an external bound-
ary if fulfills a certain characteristic mesh size. That solves
the problem partially, because the resultant external sur-
face generated using α-shapes will be different from the
previous known external boundaries. There also exist other
techniques that combine the α-shapes with the previous
boundary magnitudes, like normal vectors and directions,
that used with the proper algorithm also preserve the con-
tour surface and the volume of the model [5]. Note that
in order to deal with complex material flows, where the
material can be merged, the use of α-shapes is essen-
tial.

In this work the α-shape method has been replaced by an
alternative. In order to preserve exactly the domain contour,
a constrained Delaunay algorithm [6,26] is used. If bound-
aries are constrained the external boundaries are preserved
and the volume conservation is guaranteed. In Delaunay tri-
angulations the constrained tessellation is not difficult to
achieve, however in certain non-convex 3D domains the con-
strained tetrahedralization is not always possible. In these
cases, one possible solution consists in adding some nodes
on the border of the domain. This is not a big deal for the

PFEM, where the addition and removal of particles will be
part of the meshing procedure. Applying these techniques,
the constrained algorithm allows to perform 2D and 3D
modeling. In this work we will focus in the analysis of 2D
models.

7.2.1 Adding and removing particles

In the Lagrangian approach, the particles move because of
thematerial flow and it may happen that particles concentrate
in some regions of the domain and, on the contrary, in other
regions the number of particles becomes too low to obtain
an accurate solution. To overcome these difficulties, basic
PFEM adds and removes particles comparing with a certain
characteristic distance.

The addition and removal of particles is one of the princi-
pal tools that we have improved and extended in this work in
order to model properly the segmental creation of the chips
in a machining problem. By inserting and removing parti-
cles, the main difficulties associated with element distortion
can be solved. The insertion of particles also allows for the
resolution of the different scales of the solution. That will
permit to capture the plastic shear bands that occur during
the cut of a metal-like material.

The insertion of particles we propose applies geometrical
and mechanical criteria. The critical cases for the addition
of new particles are depicted in Fig. 5. The geometrical cri-
teria are based in a characteristic mesh sizes, i.e. h for the
element size, s for the boundary. The mechanical criterion is
based in the equal distribution of the plastic power, such that,
elements exceeding the prescribed tolerance εtol are targeted
for refinement.

Comput Mech

where Q is the mechanical power (see [27,28] ) and �e is
the domain of the element. When the condition is fulfilled, a
particle is inserted in the Gauss point of the finite element.

The most general geometrical insertion criterion is based
in the radius of an element circumsphere rec, when rec > h, a
new node is added at the center of the circumsphere or at one
of the sides of the element. For the boundary, another char-
acteristic distance s is defined, when the distance between
boundary particles di j > s, a new node is added in the cen-
ter of the boundary segment. The characteristic distance for
the boundary s has a direct relationship with the geometri-
cal resolution of the tool tip, where the cut of the material is
originated. The insertion of particles in the boundary is a fun-
damental process inmetal cutting problems. The geometrical
description of the cut is done by the insertion of particles in
the boundary of the workpiece at the tool tip. This allows for
the contour increase and creates the shape of the cut.

Similar criteria are defined for the removal of particles.
The critical cases for the removal of particles are depicted in
Fig. 6. If the distance between two nodes di j < h is smaller

than certain characteristic distance h, one of the nodes will
removed. A particular criterion with a different characteristic
distance s is applied for the boundary segments, if di j < s,
one of the nodes will removed.

The mechanical criterion for removing particles is based
on error estimators, a particle is removed if the error ‖σ −
σh‖ < εtol is smaller that a given tolerance εtol . The used
error estimators are based on plastic strain values or on
the norm of the isochoric-stress. These two magnitudes use
to describe the region of interest where the different scale
of the physical solution is taking place. The absence of
error on them says that nothing relevant occur in that zone
and therefore the finite element mesh can be coarsened if
needed.

The refinement can be applied globally to all domain or
only in a certain predefined zone of interest. Note that the
zone of interest, in a problem of cutting, can be defined as a
spatial bounding box close to the cutting tool. The refinement
procedure applied to a numerical modeling of a linear cutting
test is presented in Fig. 7.

Information Transfer scheme for the PFEM

1. Calculate the integration points global coordinates of the of the new
triangulation.

2. Update the internal variables of the new triangulation.

This step states that the integration point information of finite element in the new mesh
corresponds to the integration point information of the closest finite element in the
previous mesh. The information of the previous mesh is needed to perform this transfer.

It is important to remark that step 2 is optional.

The main advantage of the proposed strategy is that:

It is not necessary to create a complete newmesh (without step 2); we only adapt the mesh
with the addition of new particles and the mesh quality is improved using a Delaunay
triangulation insertion algorithm.

7.2.2 Elemental variables transfer

In the PFEM, particles preserve the information from mesh
to mesh. All the information necessary in subsequent time
steps has to be kept, the particle information includes nodal
displacements, temperatures, pressures, geometrical domain
labels, and characteristic sizes. If the number of particles
is not modified the information is automatically preserved.
Only in the case of the inserted particles an interpolation is
needed to define their new nodal information. In the case of
removed particles, the information stored in them is lost for
the subsequent time steps, but it is kept until the end of the
meshingprocedure to perform the interpolationswithfidelity.

The coarsening of the mesh reduces the computational
cost of the analysis, however some information is lost during
this process. If we are interested in the analysis of the residual
stresses the coarsening must be avoided.

As was explained in Sect. 7.1, the transfer of elemen-
tal information in a typical simulation with the PFEM lead
with certain smoothing of the transferred variables. That was
because the elemental information is transferred to nodes
and interpolated again to the new elements when the new
mesh is performed. This transfer scheme is in line with the
particle description of the continuum. However the loss of
information due to that transfer is severe and is a very diffu-
sive process, even if you transfer only the increments of the
elemental values.

If we look at the places where the mesh does not change,
using this transfer procedure the solution is smoothed any-
way and the equilibrium after meshing is lost. Nevertheless,
this not happens if the transfer is done directly from the
previous element to the new element. When the infor-
mation is transferred between elements, if the mesh not
changes, the solution is the same and the equilibrium is pre-
served. When the mesh is not the same, the equilibrium
is perturbed only in areas where large changes occurred
and the transformation of the information is unavoid-
able.

In Box 4, the procedure for mesh refinement and infor-
mation transfer is shown. This procedure is the one that is
applied in the examples presented in this paper for the simu-
lation of segmental chip formation in metal cutting processes
(see Fig. 7).

cutting speeds. The effect on cutting forces and chip
shapes

The application concerns the cutting of a rectangular block
of Ti6Al4V alloy of length 200 µm and width 60 µm, a cut-
ting depth of 35 µm, a rake angle of 0 and a tool radius of
2µm. The cutting speed has been varied between 0.1 and

123



Comput Mech

ting speeds (temperature in Kelvins (K) )

20 m/s. Material behavior is given by a modified Johnson–
Cook law (Bäker law) with the materials properties shown
in Tables 1 and 2. The conductivity and specific heat depend
linearly on the temperature. The tool has been assumed to be
mechanically rigid, the friction and the thermal exchange
between the work piece and the tool are neglected. The
solution scheme used in the present example is based on
the isothermal implicit scheme and the remeshing is based
on the particle finite element method (PFEM) presented in
Sects. 7 and 6. Insertion and removal of particles is used in
this example to save computing time and in order to improve
the localization phenomenon. Material separation in front of
the tool has been modeled by considering the chip formation
process as a pure deformation where material flows visco-
plastically around the tool tip. An additional tool is used in
order to avoid chip penetration in the workpiece. A total of
4000 time steps were needed in order to calculate any of the
chips shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10, the standard computing
time was 2.5–9 h on a computer running with the processor
Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.53 Ghz. The example presented in

Fig. 9 Comparison of chip morphologies of Ti6Al4V at different cut-
ting speeds (temperature in Kelvins (K) )

this section has been taken from Bäker [1] and De Micheli
[7]. An especially appealing feature of high-speed cutting
processes is that the specific cutting force for most mate-
rials strongly decreases with increasing the cutting speed.
The frequently observed transition between continuous and
segmented chip is reproduced by the model. Figures 8, 9,
and 10 show the temperature field for seven different values
of cutting speeds. At small cutting speed, continuous chip
are formed with increasing the shear angle. Chip segmen-
tation is observed at cutting speeds higher than 5 m/s and
the segmentation increases with the increase of the cutting
speed.

Figures 8, 9, and 10 show another interesting phe-
nomenon: the width of the shear zone in the continuous chip
becomes smaller with the increase of the cutting speed. As
the increasing temperature causes a decrease in hardening,
the width of the shear zone becomes smaller so that strain
rates becomes larger.

8.1.1 The cutting forces

Plots of the cutting force are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. The
plots are distance-resolved, in such a way that results for
different cutting speeds are comparable. For the continuous
chip formation, the cutting force tends to a constant value,
whereas, for the segmental chip formation, the cutting force
oscillates around a mean value. The observed decrease in the
cutting force at high cutting speed can be thus explained as
follows: increasing the cutting speed causes an increase in
the temperature. Although the strain rate increment, causes
a larger isothermal flow stress, the increment of temperature
leads to thermal softening, so that the mean flow stress is
reduced. In conclusion, the simulations show that the large
decrement of the cutting force associated with the increment
of the cutting speed ismainly a result of the thermal softening
which changes the effective stress-strain curve and increases
the shear angle.

8.1.2 Adiabatic shear band formation process

In Fig. 13, we can observe in detail the chip formation of
an adiabatic shear band in our simulation at 20 m/s. The
evolution of the cut is shown in six different time instants,
going from Fig. 13a–f, in all of them the contour fill for
the von Mises stress is depicted. The instant represented by
the Fig. 13a shows a state where one shear band is nearly
fully developed and the deformation occursmainly along this
strongly curved band. In the instant depicted by the Fig. 13b

Fig. 11 Cutting forces of Ti6Al4V at different cutting speeds

Fig. 12 Cutting forces of Ti6Al4V at different cutting speeds

the deformation occurs in this band, but there is also some
deformation in the region behind this shear band, leading to
a damming of the material. Generally, the concentration of
the deformation begins at the tool tip, but a second defor-
mation concentration starts at the free surface, close to the
tool rake face (see Fig. 13c) before the shear band is fully
formed. The cutting force increases during the first stages
and reaches a maximum during this phase because the newly
forming shear band. Although the deformation concentrates
during the instants shown in Fig. 13c, d, this shear localiza-
tion is not coloured by the plot of the vonMises stress contour
fill. During this cutting fase, the von Mises stress inside the
zone where deformation concentrates is larger than in the
adjacent zones, mainly due to the higher strain rates in this
region. In the instance depicted in Fig. 13e, true strain local-
ization has begun near the tool tip as the von Mises stress
experience a important decrement there. This has a direct
correlation with the large increment in the temperature field.

123



Comput Mech

Fig. 13 Development of the von Mises stress inside a chip for a cutting speed of 20 m/s (MPa)

At that instant, the area of deformation concentrates at the
free surface, which is not a localized deformed area because
the vonMises stress is larger there than in the adjacent zones.

Therefore there are two zones where the deformation con-
centrates, the main localization of the deformation grows
continuously from the tool tip and afterwards the two zones
join. When the localization has started; no further deforma-
tion takes place in the dammed region behind the shear band.
When the two areas of large deformation are joined all strains
get concentrated inside the shear band (see Fig. 13f).

9 Conclusions

In this work, the chip formation of Ti6Al4V during cutting is
studied using revised Particle Finite Element Method. A first
conclusion is that PFEM is well adapted for the simulation
of the complex processes involved. The obtained results are
in good agreement with those presented in the literature (see
[1,7]).

Effects observed experimentally for many materials,
namely a reduction in the cutting force followed by a plateau
region, and the transition between continuous and segmented
chips, have been successfully reproduced by the PFEM sim-
ulation. It was shown that the reduction in the cutting force
can be understood as an effect of thermal softening which
causes a change in the effective stress-strain curves of the
material and thus increases the shear angle and reduces the
amount of plastic deformation necessary to deform the chip.
The transition from continuous to segmented chips causes
a further reduction in the cutting force, which is, however,
much smaller. The results presented in this paper have thus
given evidence that experimentally observed trends in chip
formation can be predicted by PFEM.

In conclusion, it should be noted that investigating an ide-
alized process (neglection of friction, deformation of the tool
and a simplified flow stress law) seems to be a fruitfulmethod
to understand details of the chip formation process. A nec-
essary improvement of the model presented in this paper
concerns in the inclusion of the neglected phenomena (fric-

tion, deformation of the tool, more complex flow stress and
the heat transfer between the tool and the workpiece) (see
[20]).
