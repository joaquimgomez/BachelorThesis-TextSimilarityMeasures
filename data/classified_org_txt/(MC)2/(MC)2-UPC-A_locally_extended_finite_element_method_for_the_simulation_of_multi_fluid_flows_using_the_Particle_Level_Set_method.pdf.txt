Abstract

The simulation of immiscible two-phase flows on Eulerian meshes requires the use of special techniques to guarantee a
sharp definition of the evolving fluid interface. This work describes the combination of two distinct technologies with
the goal of improving the accuracy of the target simulations. First of all, a spatial enrichment is employed to improve
the approximation properties of the Eulerian mesh. This is done by injecting into the solution space new features to
make it able to correctly resolve the solution in the vicinity of the moving interface. Then, the Lagrangian Particle
Level Set (PLS) method is employed to keep trace of the evolving solution and to improve the mass conservation
properties of the resulting method. While the local enrichment can be understood in the general context of the XFEM,
we employ an element-local variant, which allows preserving the matrix graph, and hence highly improving the
computational efficiency.

Keywords: Two-phase flows, Enrichment, Discontinuous pressure, XFEM, Particle Level Set.

1. Introduction

The simulation of multi-fluid problems faces two
main challenges. The first one is related to the difficulty
in approximating kinks and jumps in the simulated field,
and the second one is connected to the difficulty in ac-
curately capturing or tracking the interface between dif-
ferent fluids [1].

If the interface-tracking approach is used, the compu-
tational domain adapts itself to the shape and position of
the interface. The mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian approach
in [2], the space-time approach in [3] or the pure La-
grangian particle finite element (PFEM) approach in [4]
are among this family. The way the interface is tracked
is on itself a parameter of paramount importance in the
treatment of the jump/kink in unknown fields. The main
drawback of interface-tracking methods is the need for
regenerating the computational mesh at the distorted
zones. Recent developments in the PFEM seem to cir-
cumvent this problem by convecting particles and then
projecting and solving on the fixed mesh [5].

The alternative approach to the treatment of the inter-
face, called interface-capturing method, is based on the
idea of capturing the position of the interface by keep-
ing trace of some marker field. Typical examples of
this approach are the Volume of Fluid method (VOF)
and the Level Set method. Interface-capturing meth-
ods have gained more popularity as they easily deal
with merging and breaking-up of the interface. In the
Level Set method, the interface is represented implic-
itly as the zero-level of a smooth function and typically
the signed distance function is the candidate. Since the
values of the level-set function are needed exclusively
in the vicinity of the interface, it is often observed that
this equation is only solved there [6, 7]. Despite many
efforts in using high order spatial and temporal schemes
to evolve the distance function, it needs to be reinitial-
ized frequently as it soon ceases to be a distance func-
tion. Unfortunately, it appears to be difficult to con-
serve the interface during the reinitialization process
which often leads to the breakdown of the mass conser-
vation. Various solutions have been proposed to over-
come this problem. In [8, 9] the volume-of-fluid (VOF)
method is coupled with the Level Set method to obtain
a second-order technique which is generally superior
to either method alone. The Particle Level Set (PLS)
method introduced in [10] uses Lagrangian marker par-

ticles to rebuild the level set in regions which are under-
resolved. This is often the case for flows undergoing
stretching and tearing. Particles are seeded near the
interface and contain a local measure of the interface
position that is used to correct the level set function
error due to convection or reinitialization. Geometric
mass-preserving redistance method proposed in [11, 12]
and developed for unstructured meshes, avoid a uniform
mass-conserving correction. This method computes a
node-wise correction on a narrow band close to the in-
terface considering that mass loss/gain concentrates on
the interface zones with higher curvature. The Discon-
tinuous Galerkin (DG) method has also been applied to
improve mass conservation of the level set method. The
quadrature-free DG method developed in [13] for the
conservative form of the level set equation remains sta-
ble even if the level set diverges from a signed distance
function.

Unfortunately, as we anticipated before, even when
the position of the interface in space is known, a second
challenge arises: accurately approximating the fields
of interest within the cut elements close to the inter-
face. Sharp definition of the interface results in cut ele-
ments. If jumps in material properties are large or inter-
face forces are involved, the conventional FEM can not
capture the possible jump/kink in the pressure/velocity
fields. One solution is to assign a numerical thickness
to the interface that provides a smooth transition in the
material properties at both sides of the interface [14].
This type of methods requires constant interface thick-
ness during time. However, if a sharp interface is de-
sired, cut elements need to be enriched. In [15] pressure
is locally enriched at the interface to capture a kink in
the pressure field. In [16] two enrichment functions,
one for each side of the cut, are introduced at the el-
ements crossed by the interface. These functions are
local to each element, linear on each side of the inter-
face, discontinuous along the interface and zero at the
element nodes. Similar to [15], these enrichments are
condensed before assembly. Beside local enrichment,
global one, and in particular the XFEM have been also
widely used to model multi-fluid flow [17–20]. Except
for the intrinsic XFEM [21], all versions of the XFEM
add enrichments to the global system and therefore the
graph of the system needs to be updated as the interface
moves.

In this work we present a local enrichment only for
the pressure field and couple it with the PLS method.
The basis for the enrichment are taken from the shifted
XFEM [22], or its equivalent [23], and presented for tri-
angular and tetrahedral elements. Basically inside each
element we add one enrichment for each node and then

condense them all at the element level. This enrichment
can be seen as an extension to the ones proposed in [15]
and [16] that locally add one or two DOFs, respectively.
We then couple this enrichment with the PLS method to
capture the interface. The overall system is presented in
the residual-based variational multiscale stabilized form
similar to the one proposed in [15, 20].

The content of this paper is presented as follows. In
section 2 the incompressible two-fluid problem is pre-
sented. Our proposal for the local enrichment is intro-
duced in Section 3, and Section 4 is devoted to the PLS.
Comparison between the XFEM and our proposal and
also the effect of the PLS in the results are presented
through different numerical examples in Section 5.

2. Problem statement

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations govern-
ing the two-phase motion in a domain Ω are written as:

ρ(∂tu + u · ∇u) − ∇ · (2µ∇su) + ∇p = ρb
∇ · u = 0. (1)

This set of equations is completed by the appropriate
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The do-
main Ω is split into two parts, denoted by + and −, with
the following material properties:

(ρ(x), µ(x)) =
{

(ρ+, µ+) if x ∈ Ω+
(ρ−, µ−) if x ∈ Ω−.

Note that a jump in density at the interface Γ produces a
discontinuity in the pressure gradient, and a jump in vis-
cosity causes a discontinuity in pressure. Surface ten-
sion can also produce a jump in the pressure field at the
interface.

In this work we do not consider the effect of surface
tension and therefore we have the balance of the internal
forces at the interface as:

(σ− − σ+) · n = 0.

The internal stress σ at each domain has the form σ =
−pI + 2µ∇su.

The variational equivalent of (1) is to find (u, p) ∈

obtained using the Algebraic Sub-grid Scale (ASGS)
method [24] or the Finite Calculus [25] approach. Non-
linearities are best handled in an implicit fashion using
a residual-based Newton-Raphson strategy. Temporal
discretization is performed by a second order Bossak
scheme [27] (or see page 543 in [26]). The semi-
discrete stabilized variational form of this problem is:

and the stabilization parameters are,

τ1 =

and τ2 = µ + 0.5ρhe|ue|,

where he and ue are the characteristic elemental length
and the velocity vector, respectively. Accurate solution
of (2) requires a modification in the finite element space,
to capture the possible kink or jump expected at the so-
lution.

3. Enrichment

When the interface cut elements on a fixed mesh, the
jump in density causes a kink in the pressure field and
hence it induces a jump in its gradient at the interface

ements can not represent a kink in the pressure field inside an element.

position (Figure 1). It is clear that for simple elements,
triangles in 2D and tetrahedra in 3D, the linear approx-
imation of pressure can not represent the expected kink
in pressure. The pressure field does not belong anymore
to the standard one, and therefore one way to capture it
is to add enrichments to the standard field in these ele-
ments.

Remark. The method described in this work is
mainly applied to physical problems dominated by grav-
itational forces, i.e. small errors in the pressure can lead
to large errors in the velocity. Therefore, an improve-
ment of the pressure approximation is more beneficial
than modifying the velocity approximation. Numerical
studies performed in [19] suggest that it is not advisable
to enrich the velocity approximation space as it does not
improve the results significantly. Severe convergence
problems and an increase in the required number of it-
erations have been also reported as the consequences of
the velocity enrichment.

We define the enriched pressure field at each cut ele-
ment as:

peh =
Nnode∑

i

Nei p
e
i +

Nnode∑

i

Mi(p
e
enr)i . (3)

Here (peenr)i are the elemental pressure enrichments
associated to the corresponding enrichment basis Mi.
These basis are defined at each node of the cut element
as:

Mi(x, t) = Ni(x, t) · [ψ(x, t) − ψ(xi, t)], (4)

with ψ(x, t) being the global enrichment function and
Ni(x, t) is the standard FE shape function for node i.
This definition for Mi(x, t) has the property that Mi(x, t)
is zero in the mesh nodes and takes its maximum at the
interface. Zero support at the nodes facilitates inter-
preting the new added DOF as local to the cut element
rather than global. This definition for Mi(x, t) ensures

Kronecker-δ property of the overall approximation. It
means that at each given node i, pressure is only inter-
polated with its own nodal value because any other node
j has zero support at node i. The enrichments do not af-
fect explicitly the nodal approximation of pressure as
they are zero at the nodes of the mesh. These basis are
known as the XFEM shifted basis [19] in the literature.

Two definitions are proposed for ψ in the literature.
In case of strong discontinuities (jump in pressure) sign
enrichment is defined as:

ψsign(x, t) = sign(φ(x, t)) =




−1 if φ(x, t) < 0
0 if φ(x, t) = 0
1 if φ(x, t) > 0.

(5)

where φ(x, t) is the level set function that is defined
as the signed distance function whose zero matches
the interface position. Its exact definition is presented
in Section 4. Similarly for the weak discontinuities
(kink in pressure fields) Moës et al. [28] and Hansbo
& Hansbo [23] separately proposed an abs-enrichment
shape function that is defined as:

ψabs(x, t) =
Nnode∑

i

|φi|Ni(x, t) − |
Nnode∑

i

φiNi(x, t)|.

Figure 2 shows the enrichment shape functions, Mi,
for weak and strong discontinuities in a triangular ele-
ment.

Remark. Numerical results in [19] suggest that even
when no surface tension is considered, sign-enrichment
provides better results than abs-enrichment although the
latter seems sufficient. Using the sign-enrichment, a
larger approximation space for the pressure is provided
which also allows capturing strong discontinuities in
pressure. On the other hand, we know that a discon-
tinuity in pressure not only appears due to the surface
tension effect, but also due to viscosity jumps [29].
Therefore, In this work we only consider the sign-
enrichments:

ψ(x, t) = ψsign(x, t).

As already mentioned, these enrichments have zero sup-
port at the nodes and therefore can be interpreted as lo-
cal to each cut element. The matrix form of the semi-
discrete stabilized form (2), using equations (5), (4) and
(3), at each cut element is written as:

element, U = {u,p}, and Penr contains the elemental
enrichments for pressure. Following this arrangement,
matrix A contains all terms related to the original DOFs,
U, matrix B contains terms related to the original DOFs
and enrichments, and matrix D contains terms related
only to the enrichments, Penr. Note that, to be consis-
tent, the enrichment is also applied to the test function of
pressure. Vector F represents the body force term. Ex-
act computation of the integrals in (2) requires a modifi-
cation in the quadrature rule. To this end, each triangu-
lar element (tetrahedral in 3D) is split into sub-elements
and for each sub-element the same integration rule as
for the non-cut elements is used (see Figure 2b).

Now we proceed to the condensation by computing
first the enriched pressures Penr from the second equa-

tion in (6) as:
Penr = −D−1BT U,

and then plug it into the first equation in (6) to obtain,

(A − BD−1BT )U = F,

at each cut element. The condensation process is valid
as long as the matrix D is invertible. Recalling equation
(2), D is the Laplacian of the enriched pressures com-
puted as:

D = τ1

∫

Ωe

∇penr · ∇qenr dΩe.

From the definition of M in (4), it is clear that, no matter
where the interface is, the ∇Mi is always bounded and
actually constant in each side of the interface. As the
result, D is always invertible unless if for some Mi the
support tends to zero.

Remark. The enrichment shape functions with small
support typically occur when the interface is close to a
node or edge and lead to an ill-conditioned system ma-
trix. Two approaches to treat this problem are given
in [30–32]. In this work we use the blocking crite-
ria proposed in [30] in which for each cut element en-
richment is considered if the ratio between the mini-
mum and maximum sub-volumes is bounded by a user-
defined constant C � 1, i.e.

min(Ve1 ,V
e
2)

max(Ve1 ,V
e
2)
< C. (7)

Note that doing condensation, the cut element ends
up having the same DOFs, U, as the rest of the ele-
ments and therefore the graph of the matrix remains un-
changed as the interface evolves. This is not the case
for the conventional XFEM where the enrichments are
global.

Figure 3 compares our proposed local enrichment
and the XFEM. In local case, Figure 3a, only the cut
elements are engaged and the additional DOFs are rep-
resented with black circles inside each element. On
the other hand in the XFEM enrichment scheme, Fig-
ure 3b, three types of subdomains are usually distin-
guished. The first one, Ωenr, is composed of elements
cut by the interface which have all nodes enriched. The
second subdomain, Ωpenr, has all elements that have at
least one node enriched, and the last subdomain is the
collection of elements with standard DOFs and with-
out enrichment. In XFEM, as the interface moves, new
elements are cut and so new global DOFs need to be
considered. This means that the graph of the matrix as-

sembly need to be recomputed, which is quite costly for
large problems.

Remark. Note that the XFEM provides a continu-
ous pressure field at the nodes and at the inter-element
boundaries, while the local enrichments are only con-
tinuous at the nodes (they are zero at the nodes) and
not at the inter-element boundaries. This irregularity in
pressure is still acceptable because pressure, as appears
in (2), belongs to the L2(Ω) space and does not require
control over the derivatives.

Remark. Similar local enrichments that add one en-
richment for the cut element or two, one at each side of
the interface, already exist in the literature. One of such

elements cut by the interface. This function has the con-
stant gradient at each side of the interface and has zero
support at the nodes. Nenr is defined by the level set
values φ at the element nodes as:

Nenr = 0.5(−|
Nnode∑

i

Nei φi| +
Nnode∑

i

Nei |φi|).

This definition for Nenr is quite similar to the definition
for ψabs shown in Figure 2c. Note that here this function
is directly used as the enrichment shape function while
in XFEM it is used to define Mi.

The enrichment proposed in [15] suffers from insta-
bilities. The idea proposed here of capturing the kink
in the pressure field with just one added DOF perfectly
works for 1D problems. However, for 2D and 3D sit-
uations one enrichment is not sufficient to capture the
correct pressure field and actually one enrichment per
cut edge seems more appropriate. Intuitively, as long as
the edges are cut at the same height, one enrichment is
sufficient but when deviation occurs and therefore each
edge is cut at a different height, more than one enrich-
ment is needed. As for 3D problems the number of cut
edges can reach up to four in each tetrahedra, a generic
enrichment that covers all cases would be an enrich-
ment at each node. Our proposed local XFEM satisfies
this requirement as all nodes are enriched, and at the
same time takes advantage of the condensation to avoid
change in the graph of the matrix as is common in con-
ventional XFEM.

In the following section we review an interface cap-
turing technique based on the Level Set method. No
iteration is considered between the multi-fluid solver
and the interface capturing one. At each time step, first
the interface is moved and then one step of the predic-
tor multi-corrector fluid solver is performed. This is in
contrast to some more sophisticated coupling strategies
such as those presented in [33] and [19].

4. Particle Level Set (PLS) method

The underlying idea behind the Level Set method is
to represent an interface as the zero-level set of a higher
dimensional function φ(x, t). This function is scalar
and substantially reduces the complexity of describing
the interface, especially when undergoing topological
changes such as pinching and merging. The level set
function φ(x, t) is defined to be a smooth function that is
positive in one region and negative in the other.

The motion of the interface is determined by a ve-
locity field, u, which can be a function of position, time

and geometry of the interface, or be given externally, for
instance as the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
(1). The advection equation for the interface evolution
is:

φt + u · ∇φ = 0. (8)

This level set equation is a first order hyperbolic PDE
and only needs to be solved near the interface.

The most common choice for the level set function
φ is the signed distance to the interface so that |∇φ| =
1. This ensures that the level set is a smoothly varying
function well suited for high order accurate numerical
methods. There are several techniques to solve the level
set equation (8) in space and time [6, 7].

Despite the high order temporal and spatial approxi-
mations of the level set equation, instabilities may ap-
pear when the level set cease to be a signed distance
function. This situation occurs at the presence of large
topological changes at the interface vicinity, which are
quite common in practical problems. One solution is
to reshape the level set function to a distance function.
This method, called reinitialization, has been shown
to stabilize the numerical instabilities and is performed
frequently during the evolution of the interface. Reini-
tialization is performed at each time step by solving to
steady state (as fictitious time τ→ ∞) the equation:

φτ + sgn(φ0)(‖ ∇φ ‖ −1) = 0. (9)

where sgn(φ0) is a one-dimensional smeared out signum
function [14].

Unfortunately, one of the major drawbacks of the
reinitialization process is the difficulty in preserving the
original location of the interface, often leading to break-
down in the conservation of mass. To overcome this
problem of mass loss with the level set method (Figure
4a), various solutions have been proposed [10, 11, 13,
34].

The PLS [10] method uses Lagrangian marker parti-
cles to rebuild the level set in regions which are under-
resolved. This is often the case for flows undergoing
stretching and tearing. Two sets of massless marker par-
ticles are placed near the interface with one set, the pos-
itive particles, in the φ > 0 region and the other set, the
negative particles in the φ < 0 region (Figure 4b). It is
unnecessary to place particles far from the interface and
this greatly reduces the number of particles needed in a
simulation. The region near the interface could be con-
sidered as the region covered by all elements that have at
least one corner with the distance inferior to three times
the element size. In this work 10 particles are seeded

in each tetrahedral element, which is different from the
4d (d is the dimension) particles proposed in the origi-
nal work for the cubic elements [10]. Considering that
each cubic element could be divided into 6 tetrahedra
the choice of 10 particles is reasonable. The placement
of the massless particles around the zero-level set for
this test can be seen in Figure 4b. In Figure 4c the PLS
solution after one revolution is shown.

terface for the Zalesak test. C) PLS solution after one revolution.

For the purpose of interface reconstruction a radius
rp is assigned to each particle as the function of its dis-
tance to the interface. This radius is bounded by min-
imum and maximum values based upon the mesh size
near the interface (0.1d < rp < 0.5d , d is the mean
mesh size). Note that this radius provides a local mea-
sure to the interface position. Once particles are seeded
and their radius adjusted, the level set equation (8) is in-
tegrated forward in time. Then, particles are advected
with the evolution equation

dxp
dt

= u(xp), (10)

where xp is the position of the particle and u(xp) is its
velocity. The particle velocities are interpolated from
the velocities on the underlying grid.

Remark. In this work we use the second order Crank-
Nicolson method for the time stepping of the level set
equation (8). The particle evolution equation (10) is in-
tegrated in time using sub-stepping technique in which
10 sub-steps are considered.

In smooth well resolved regions of the flow where the
level set method is highly accurate, the particles do not
drift a non-trivial distance across the interface allowing
us to maintain a high order accurate level set solution.
Instead, in under-resolved regions we find particles that
are on the wrong side of the interface by more than their
radius. We define a particle as escaped particle only if
it crosses the interface by more than its radius. Escaped
particles are used to reconstruct the level set function in

under-resolved regions.
To this end, a local level set function is defined for

each escaped particle by means of the radius associated
to the particle as:

φp(x) = sp(rp− ‖ x − xp ‖), (11)

where sp is the sign of the particle, i.e. ±1. These level
sets are only defined locally on the corners of the el-
ement containing the escaped particle and can be seen
as the particle predictions of the values of the level set
function on the corners of the element. Any variation
of φ from φp indicates possible errors in the level set
solution.

The escaped positive particles are used to rebuild the
φ > 0 region and the escaped negative particles to re-
build the φ ≤ 0 region. For example, take the φ > 0
region and an escaped positive particle. Using equation
(11), the φp values of the grid points on the element con-
taining the particle are calculated. Each φp is compared
to the local values of φ and the maximum of these two
values is taken as φ+. This is done for all escaped pos-
itive particles creating a reduced error representation of
the φ > 0 region. That is, given a level set φ and a set
of escaped positive particles E+, we initialize φ+ with φ
on all grid points and then calculate

φ+ = max
∀p∈E+

(φp, φ
+).

Note that this operation is done only for the escaped
positive particles and φp’s are only calculated on the el-
ements containing the escaped particles. Similarly for
the negative region, φ ≤ 0, we initialize φ− with φ and
then calculate

φ− = min
∀p∈E−

(φp, φ
−).

φ+ and φ− will not agree due to the errors in both the par-
ticle and the level set solutions as well as interpolation
errors, etc. We merge φ+ and φ− back into a single level
set value by setting φ to the value of φ+ or φ− which is
least in magnitude at each grid point,

φ =

{
φ+ if |φ+| 6 |φ−|
φ− if |φ+| > |φ−|.

The minimum magnitude is used to reconstruct the
interface (instead of, for example, taking an average),
since it gives priority to values that are closer to the in-
terface.

The PLS method is also capable of correcting the er-
rors due to the reinitialization. During the reinitializa-

tion step, particles are not moved to conserve the zero-
level set and then any error in the reinitialization scheme
is corrected by them. After the reinitialization and cor-
rection steps, the radii of the particles are adjusted ac-
cording to the current value of φ(xp).

In summary the order of operation in one time step of
the PLS method is as follows:

• Solve the level set equation (8) and move the par-
ticles.

• Correct errors in the level set function using parti-
cles.

• Reinitialize the distance function and again correct
errors using particles.

• Adjust the particle radii.
• Reseed particles, if necessary, to have a uniform

distribution.

Our proposed local XFEM is loosely coupled with
the PLS method to perform numerical examples as
shown in the following section. At each time step first
the interface is moved, and then one step of the predictor
multi-corrector fluid solver is performed.

5. Numerical examples

All the following examples are solved on tetrahedral
meshes and no surface tension is considered. Regard-
ing the PLS method, the maximum seeding distance is
limited to 3h, where h is the maximum edge size. The
constant used in the enrichment criteria of Eq. (7) is
taken as C = 10−4.

5.1. Rayleigh-Taylor instability

A single mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability is consid-
ered to study the interface capturing technique coupled
with the enrichment method. This instability occurs
when a heavy fluid is accelerated into a light one due
to gravity forces. Various authors have used XFEM
or other stabilized methods coupled with the Level
Set method and hexahedral elements for the simula-
tion of this phenomenon [20, 35]. A rectangular do-
main Ω = [L × H] with L = 0.5 m and H = 4 m is
extruded in the third direction by one element thick-
ness h = 0.015625 m. The domain is uniformly dis-
cretized by 49152 tetrahedra (32 × 256 × 1 cubes,
each of which divided into 6 tetrahedra). The insta-
bility is triggered by a cos form deviation of the am-
plitude 0.05 at the horizontal interface between two

fluids, z = 0.05cos(2πx). The top heavy fluid has a
density ρ+ = 3 kg/m3 and a dynamic viscosity µ+ =
0.0135 kg/(ms) and the bottom light fluid has ρ− =
1 kg/m3 and µ− = 0.0045 kg/(ms). The gravitational
acceleration of magnitude g = −10 m/s2 in the z di-
rection is considered. Similar dimensionless Reynold
number, Re =

gHLρ+/µ+ =

√
gHLρ−/µ− = 500 and

Atwood number, A = ρ
+−ρ−
ρ++ρ− = 0.5, as in [20, 35] are

obtained. Slip boundary conditions are considered on
the side walls, no-slip condition on the bottom wall and
zero pressure is prescribed at the upper wall. No surface
tension is considered and a fixed time step of ∆t = 0.01s
is used. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the interface at
different instances along the formation of the instabil-
ity. Our results are compared well with the results ob-
tained in [20, 35] with hexahedral meshes of the same
size. The maximum mass fluctuation is approximately
0.12%. In [20] a mass fluctuation of 0.10% and in [35]
a mass fluctuation of 0.07% was observed for a second-
order level-set scheme.

The ability of the proposed enriched method to model
the free surface behavior is studied in this example.

The computational domain is a rectangle of dimensions
[0, 1] × [0, 1.5] in the XZ plane that is extruded over a
length 0.0125 in the Y direction. A [80 × 120] divi-
sion in the XZ plane results in a uniform mesh of 57600
tetrahedra. The interface separating the two phases is
initially given as a sinusoidal wave with an amplitude
equal to 0.1 as, Z = 1.01 + 0.1sin((x − 0.5)π). The level
set is initialized as the distance to this sinusoidal inter-
face. The densities of the fluids are ρ+ = 1.0 kg/m3

and ρ− = 1000.0 kg/m3 and the dynamic viscosities
are µ+ = 0.01 kg/(ms) and µ− = 1.0 kg/(ms). Consid-
ering g = −1 m/s2, the non-dimensional Froude and
Reynolds number are 1 and 1000, respectively. Slip
boundary condition is considered for the side walls,
while the bottom wall is considered no-slip and pres-
sure is fixed to zero on the top wall. The time step is
∆t = 0.0075 s and the end time is 20 s. The position
of the free surface and the underlying pressure is shown
in Figure 6. The time history of the height of the in-
terface on the right side wall is shown in Figure 7 and
is compared with the XFEM. It can be seen that due
to the viscous damping the amplitude of the height de-
creases. The mean frequency of the oscillation is 0.277
Hz, which agrees with reported values 0.279 [36] and
0.274 [20]. Note that in this example no difference is
observed between the results of the Level Set and PLS
methods. This can be explained as no tearing or merg-
ing of the interface occurs and therefore volume is con-
served well even with the Level Set method.

5.3. Rising bubble

The rise and deformation of 2D and 3D bubbles in
vertical, rectangular container is considered here in the
absence of surface tension. The density of water and
air were taken to be, 1000.0 kg/m3 and 1.226 kg/m3, re-
spectively. The viscosity of the surrounding water was
taken as 0.35 kg/(ms), and the viscosity of the air in-
side the bubble to be 0.00358 kg/(ms). These values
result in a jump approximately equal to 1000 in density
and 100 in viscosity. The initial diameter of the bub-
ble was D = 0.05m and g = −9.81 m/s2. For the 2D
case the width and the height of the rectangular domain
were considered 2 times and 4 times of that the bub-
ble diameter, respectively, which results in a rectangu-
lar domain of [0.1 × 0.2]. The extension in the third di-
mension was considered as one element thickness. With
the above parameters the Reynolds number, defined as
Re = ρD

tends to infinity as no surface tension was considered
(γ = 0). For these parameters formation of a skirted
bubble is reported [37, 38]. A uniform tetrahedral mesh

of size 0.0025 was considered (40 × 80 × 1) and the
time step increment was equal to 0.002 s. Pressure was
assigned to zero on the top wall and slip boundary con-
ditions were considered on the side and bottom walls.

field for various instances during the deformation of the

reported in [33, 36] for large Eötvös numbers.

5.3.1. 3D
The same parameters as for the 2D case were con-

sidered for the 3D case. The computational domain
was a box of [0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2] m, uniformly discretized
by tetrahedra of size 0.0025. No surface tension was
considered and the time stepping was equal to 0.002 s.
Our results are similar to those obtained in [33, 38] for

Re = 100 and a large Eötvös number but are obviously
different from the results obtained in [20], although the
setting exactly matches this reference. Simulations car-
ried on in [33, 38] for large density ratio, around 1000,
and small surface tension suggest that the deformation
of the bubble from a sphere to an elliptic cap extends to
the bell shape and eventually ends up with the piercing
of the top surface as shown in Figure 9. The impor-
tance of the PLS method on the mass conservation can
be seen in Figure 10 where the volume fluctuation per-
centage for the bubble is compared for the pure level set
and PLS methods. We also observe that if the Level Set
method is used and no correction is done to preserve the
volume, no piercing of the top surface appears which is
similar to the results obtained in [20].

5.3.2. Coalescence
Coalescence of two bubbles in 3D is simulated to

study the performance of the method in the pres-
ence of multiple interfaces [33]. Two bubbles of the
same density and viscosity, ρb = 1 kg/m

3 and µb =
0.00025 kg/(ms), are surrounded by a fluid of density
ρ f = 10 kg/m

3 and viscosity µb = 0.0005 kg/(ms). Due
to the symmetry and to better appreciate the interior sur-
faces of the bubbles, one forth of the model is consid-
ered only. Figure 11 shows the initial position of the
bubbles in the simulation box. The lower and upper
bubbles have a radius of rl = 0.1 m and ru = 0.15 m,
respectively. The distance between the centers of the
bubbles is 0.3 m and the lower bubble is placed 0.25 m
away from the bottom wall. The box has the dimensions
of [0.5 m×0.5 m×1 m] and is discretized uniformly with
tetrahedra of size 0.01. Pressure is fixed on the top wall
of the box and the slip condition is applied to the rest of

the walls. The setting of this example is similar to the
one proposed in [33].

Figure 11: Initial position of the bubbles and a zoom of the pressure
field near the bubbles’ zone.

The bubbles are lighter than the surrounding water
and rise in time. The pressure gradient imposes that the
bottom interface of the bubbles travel faster compared
to the front one. However, the lower bubble, which is
in the wake of the larger one, tries to move fast from
the front too (Figure 12b). As time evolves an upward
moving jet is produced in the volume between the two
bubbles that affects the bubbles’ transient motion and
their shape. The bottom of the lower bubble also de-
forms from spheric to elliptic shape similarly to the sin-
gle bubble behavior. The evolution of the interfaces can
be seen in Figure 12. Both bubbles develop a toroidal
shape and at t = 0.21 s the front portion of the small
bubble almost catches up with the bottom portion of the
larger bubble. Figure 13a shows the interface position
of the merged bubble and the pressure field in a diag-
onal cut through the domain. The underlying particles
are seen in Figure 13b, the red particles are the bubble
particles (negative distance) and the blue ones are the
surrounding fluid particles (positive distance). In Fig-
ure 13c the particle radii that are the local measure of
the interface are shown for the particles near the inter-
face.

6. Conclusion

We have proposed a local XFEM method to solve
two-fluid flow problems. The pressure field is enriched
by a discontinuous basis similar to the ones used in the
standard XFEM, but condensed at the elemental level.
In this way we take advantage of the stability obtained

by the XFEM enrichments and at the same time avoid
changing the graph of the matrix as the interface moves.
No difference has been detected between the results ob-
tained using this method and those obtained with the
standard XFEM for two-fluid flow. To overcome the
mass loss/gain of the Level Set, the PLS method is cou-
pled with our local XFEM. Several benchmark prob-
lems have been solved using tetrahedral meshes. Nu-
merical results compare well with those obtained with
standard XFEM using hexahedral meshes.
