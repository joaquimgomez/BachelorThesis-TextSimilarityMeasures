a b s t r a c t 

This paper presents a study on the metal cutting simulation with a particular numerical technique, the 

Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) with a new modified time integration algorithm and incorporating 

a contact algorithm capability . The goal is to reproduce the formation of continuous chip in orthogonal 

machining. The paper tells how metal cutting processes can be modelled with the PFEM and which new 

tools have been developed to provide the proper capabilities for a successful modelling. The developed 

method allows for the treatment of large deformations and heat conduction, workpiece-tool contact in- 

cluding friction effects as well as the full thermo-mechanical coupling for contact. The difficulties associ- 

ated with the distortion of the mesh in areas with high deformation are solved introducing new improve- 

ments in the continuous Delaunay triangulation of the particles. The employment of adaptative insertion 

and removal of particles at every new updated configuration improves the mesh quality allowing for res- 

olution of finer-scale features of the solution. The performance of the method is studied with a set of 

different two-dimensional tests of orthogonal machining. The examples consider, from the most simple 

case to the most complex case, different assumptions for the cutting conditions and different material 

properties. The results have been compared with experimental tests showing a good competitiveness of 

the PFEM in comparison with other available simulation tools.

. Introduction 

.1. Description of the problem 

The metal cutting in machining is a process in which a thin

ayer of metal, the chip, is removed from the surface of a body

y the action of a wedge-shaped tool. Metal cutting processes are

resent in big industries that manufacture products with large size

omponents (i.e. automotive industry, aerospace industry, home

ppliance industry, etc.), and also in high tech industries where

mall pieces are machined with high precision tolerances. The im-

ortance of machining is such that, it is the most common used

rocess for producing components with specified geometrical di-

ensions and a determined quality in the surface finish. Its cost

Cutting is a complex physical process in which phenomena of

riction, adiabatic shear bands, excessive heating, large strains and

igh strain rates are involved. The characteristics of the tool shape,

he tip, the rake and flank angles, and the cutting speed, among

thers, play a very important role in the generated cutting forces,

he energy consumption, the tool wear and the obtained chip mor-

hology from the cut. A lot of parameters and combinations are

ossible to design the proper cut for the machining of a metal

iece. The study of metal cutting is difficult from an experimen-

al point of view, experiments are difficult to carry out. Among

he reasons there are the high speed at which the cut takes place

hen reproduce industrial machining conditions and the small

cale of the phenomena of interest that have to be observed. Fur-

hermore, the continuous development in the tool industry related

o new materials and geometries and the introduction of new ma-

erials also for the workpieces make the experimental testing a la-
orious and hard task.

When modeling a machining processes using numerical

simulation, the used method needs certain capabilities (see

Rakotomalalan et al. (1993) ; Peri and Owen (1999) ; Sekhon and

Chenot (1993) ; Marusich and Ortiz (1995) ; Limido et al. (2007) ).

Looking at what happens to the workpiece, the material is highly

deformed due to the cutting. This is translated to the modelling as

large mesh distortions if a Lagrangian mesh is considered. There-

fore, modeling a machining process becomes a major challenge

for the finite element method (FEM). A Langrangian FEM without

remeshing cannot resolve the large deformations very well. Ele-

ment distortion has been always matter of concern which limited

the analysis to incipient chip formation in some studies. Instead,

FEM with an Eulerian formulation requires the knowledge of the

chip geometry in advance, that, undoubtedly, restricts the range

of cutting conditions capable of being analyzed. In order to avoid

the disadvantages of Finite Element Lagrangian and Eulerian for-

mulations, other computational techniques have been investigated.

One of them is the Finite Element Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian

(ALE) formulation in conjunction with adaptive mesh techniques

( Rakotomalalan et al., 1993; Gadala et al., 20 02; Gadala, 20 04;

Olovsson et al., 1999 ). The ALE formulation combines the best fea-

tures of pure Lagrangian analysis (in which the mesh follows the

material) and Eulerian analysis (in which the mesh is fixed and the

material flows though the mesh). 

The main goal of this work is precisely make a contribution to

the solution of some of the problems described above through the

significant extension and improvement of the Particle Finite Ele-

ment Method (PFEM) to thermo-mechanical problems with large

deformations. This is done by means of the use of the theory of

solid mechanics and taking into account finite strains and rota-

tions, multiple contacts and generation of new surfaces. The objec-

tive is focused in the numerical simulation of metal cutting pro-

cesses. In this work, we exploit the particle and Langrangian na-

ture of PFEM and the advantages of finite element discretization to

study the formation of continuous chip shapes in steel. We are go-

ing to employ different numerical techniques for the treatment of

contact, for the constitutive modelling of the metal-like materials

as well as for the integration of the governing equations. Machin-

ing at different cutting speeds and with different tool geometries

are analyzed in order to define the proper numerical modelling for

the simulation of continuous chip formation in metal cutting. 

We start presenting the PFEM in Section 2 , the basic general

steps and the custom characteristics used in the present formu-

lation are explained. In Section 3 the coupled thermo-mechanical

problem is described with a summarized form of the balance equa-

tions of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP). The equations

are presented using the weak form of the problem and particu-

larized with the mixed displacement-pressure formulation which

prompted the use of stabilization. 

In Section 4 we present an overview of the thermo-elastoplastic

models at finite strains used to reproduce the continuous cut and

also we present a novel Impl-Ex integration scheme of the con-

stitutive equations ( Oliver et al., 2008 ). In Section 5 we describe

the contact phenomena at the workpiece-tool interface with a rigid

and a deformable models for the cutting tool. A constitutive law

for the frictional contact and the heat generation and transfer are

described in this section. 

In Section 6 , we present a new staggered algorithm, which

is based on the isothermal split presented in Simo and Miehe

(1992) and the Impl-Ex integration scheme of the constitutive

equations presented in Oliver et al. (2008) . The models presented

in Sections 4 and 5 will be used in the examples of Section 7 to

test the capabilities of the present formulation in problems of in-

dustrial interest.

. The Particle Finite Element Method 

The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) was developed first

or the treatment of fluids ( Idelsohn et al., 2004 ). The aim was to

odel free surfaces in a Lagrangian manner, following and track-

ng the fluid particles along the domain. The Lagrangian descrip-

ion of the continuum was usually applied to solids opening the

ossibilities of application to the modelling of fluid structure in-

eraction and coupled problems. A wide range of simulations has

een faced with PFEM: fluid interacting with rigid bodies, used in

arine and port engineering; erosion processes, used in river en-

ineering, mixing processes or fluid coupling with thermal effects;

rying to give a response to many industrial problems ( Onate et al.,

0 08; 20 06; Franci, 2015 ). 

As described previously, in this paper we modify and improve

he PFEM, presenting as a result a new approach to the modelling

f industrial cutting processes. This is within the theory of solids

here the Lagrangian description of the continuum is something

ore common. However finite elements have some critical limita-

ions they deform too much and its shape is distorted. That occurs

hen the material suffers large strains as in the concerning prob-

em. The role of the particle description is to solve this matter. 

The original idea of the PFEM was to improve the mesh qual-

ty by performing a re-triangulation of the domain only when is

eeded, which allows to capture large changes in the continuum

omain and avoid global remeshing and interpolation from mesh

o mesh. Usually, that is performed according to some criteria as-

ociated to element distortion. In 2D, the re-triangulation consists

n re-computing the element connectivity using a Delaunay trian-

ulation ( Delaunay, 1934; Shewchuk, 1998 ) where the current po-

ition of the particles (i.e., of the mesh nodes) is kept fixed. Mesh

istortion is corrected and improved naturally with the PFEM, be-

ause the triangulations maximize the minimum angle of all the

ngles of the triangles in the triangulation. Therefore, they tend to

void skinny triangles. 

We must mention here that first applications of the PFEM to

olid mechanics were done in problems involving large strains and

otations, multi body contacts and creation of new surfaces (rivet-

ng, powder filling and machining) ( Oliver et al., 2007; Rodriguez,

014; Rodriguez et al., 2015 ). In this work, we extended the Par-

icle Finite Element Method to the numerical simulation of metal

utting processes. 

A summary about the basis of the standard PFEM is presented

n Appendix A . An example of the remeshing scheme using PFEM

s shown in Fig. 1 . 

.1. Meshing procedure and variables transfer in the PFEM 

The basic steps of the PFEM describe the importance of the

eshing procedure which is performed via Delaunay triangulation.

his strategy has some important implications, the Delaunay tri-

ngulation generates the convex figure of minimum area that en-

loses all the points of the domain but that may be not confor-

al with the external boundaries of the solid domain. In fluids,

he tracking of the free surfaces (the domain boundaries) is a part

f the method capabilities and the boundary recognition problem

s overcome with the so-called α-shape method ( Edelsbrunner and
ucke, 1994 ). With the α-shape method one can consider that

n element of the convex hull conforms an external boundary if

ulfills a certain characteristic mesh size. That solves the problem

artially, because the resultant external surface generated using α-
hapes will be different from the previous known external bound-

ries. That may affect the volume conservation of the domain an-

lyzed which is a relevant weakness when it is applied to solid

echanics problems.

To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose the use

f a constrained Delaunay algorithm ( Delaunay, 1934; Shewchuk,

998 ). This may preserve the external boundaries and the vol-

me conservation is guaranteed. There also exist other solutions

o preserve the contour surface and the volume of the model us-

ng a non-constrained Delaunay tessellation. That solutions consist

n techniques that combine the α-shapes with the previous bound-
ry magnitudes, like normals and directions, that applied properly

lso preserve the contour surface and the volume of the model

 Carbonell, 2009 ). Note that in order to deal with complex material

ows, where the material can be merged, the use of α-shapes will
e essential. Furthermore, the use of α-shapes also allows the ex-
ension to 3D models where, in many cases, the constrained Delau-

ay tessellation is not guaranteed. Although, in certain non-convex

omains, where the constrained tessellation is not allowed, one

ossible solution consists in adding some nodes on the border of

he domain. The addition and removal of particles is one of the

sed tools in the presented meshing procedure for the PFEM. 

In the Lagrangian approach, the particles move because of the

aterial flow and it may happen that particles concentrate in same

egions of the domain and, on the contrary, in other regions the

umber of particles becomes too low to obtain an accurate solu-

ion. To overcome these difficulties, basic PFEM adds and removes

articles comparing with a certain characteristic distance h (the

ize is problem depend and usually constant along the domain)

see Cremonesi (2010) ; Cremonesi et al. (2010a )). If the distance

etween two nodes d nodes is d nodes < h , one of the nodes is re-

oved. If the radius of an element circumsphere r ec is r ec > h , a

ew node is added at the center of the circumsphere. The flow

ariables in the new node are linearly interpolated from that of

he element nodes, and the assigned material properties are the

nes of the elements. 

The addition and removal of particles is one of the principal

ools that we have extended into the PFEM. By inserting and re-

oving particles, the main difficulties associated with element dis-

ortion, can be solved and it also allows for the resolution the dif-

m  
erent scales of the solution. The addition and removal of particles

mprove the quality of the solution, and allows us to reach a solu-

ion if the mesh is too coarse. 

emoving particles 

The removal of particles is based on geometrical criteria and

hysical error estimators. First, if the distance between two nodes

 nodes < h is smaller than certain characteristic distance h , one of

he nodes will removed (see Fig. 2 in the middle). Second, if the

rror estimator ‖ σ − σh ‖ < ε tol , a Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estima-
or ( Zienkiewicz and Zhu, 1992a; 1992b ), is smaller tha t a given

olerance εtol , the particle that is in the center of the patch is re-
oved (see Fig. 2 in the left). The error estimators used are based

n plastic strain values or on the norm of the isochoric-stress. Two

agnitudes that describe the region of interest where the different

cale of the physical solution is taking place. The absence of error

n them says that nothing relevant occur in that zone and that the

nite element mesh can be coarsened if needed. 

Third, in the domain boundary, the removal of particles follows

nly the criterion based on a characteristic distance d nodes < h s 
see Fig. 2 in the right). 

dding particles 

The insertion of particles we propose is based on the equidis-

ribution of the plastic power, such that, elements exceeding the

rescribed tolerance εtol are targeted for refinement.

here D mech is the mechanical power (see Simo (1988a ); 1988b ))
nd �e is the domain of the element. When the condition is ful-

lled, a particle is inserted in the Gauss point of the finite element.

ere we also account for the basic mesh size refinement, that is if

he radius of an element circumsphere mathec is r ec > h , a new

ode is added at the center of the circumsphere. 

In the domain boundary, the insertion of particles is a funda-

ental thing for metal cutting problems. The geometrical descrip-

tion of the cut is done by the insertion of particles in the boundary

of the workpiece at the tool tip. This allows for the contour in-

crease and creates the shape of the cut. The criterion used for the

insertion of particles is based on a characteristic distance d nodes >

h s . This characteristic distance h s has a direct relationship with the

geometrical resolution of the cutting tool tip, where the cut of the

material is originated. The critical cases for the addition of new

particles are depicted in Fig. (3) . 

Information transfer 

In order to not destroy the finite element solution from one re-

connection step to another, the transfer of the information is cru-

cial. All the information necessary in subsequent time steps has

to be transferred from the old mesh to the new mesh, it includes

the nodal information like displacements, temperatures, pressure

in the new inserted particles, and the Gauss point information like

internal variables in the new element. 

Particles preserve the information from mesh to mesh. Only in

the case of the inserted particles an interpolation is needed to de-

fine their new nodal information. In the case of removed parti-

cles, the information stored in them is lost for the subsequent time

steps, but it is kept until the end of the meshing procedure to per-

form the interpolations with fidelity. The coarsening of the mesh is

useful to reduce the computational cost of the model, however is

not always possible to coarsen the mesh if the information has to

be preserved. One example of this are the residual stresses in the

model. If the model is coarsened this information will be lost. 

The loss of information is not only due to mesh coarsening also

to the transfer of information between Gauss points. The classical

PFEM transfer is focused in keeping the information in particles.

It transfers the elemental values to particles and it recovers them
ater to Gauss points. This is a very diffusive process, even if you

ransfer only the increments of the elemental values. In the places

here the mesh does not change the solution is smoothed any-

ay and the equilibrium information is lost. That not happens if

he transfer is done directly from the previous element to the new

lement. If the information is transferred between elements, when

esh does not change, the solution is the same and the equilib-

ium is preserved. When the mesh is not the same, the equilib-

ium is perturbed only in areas where large changes occurred and

he transformation of the information is unavoidable. A thermo-

echanical traction test was presented in a previous work (see

odriguez et al. (2016) ), where the solution using PFEM and FEM

as compared, and as a result similar result were obtained, show-

ng that the effect of transfer the internal variables from gauss

oint to gauss point as is done is the present work is negligible

n problems similar to the ones presented in this work. 

In Box 1 , the procedure for mesh refinement and information

ransfer is shown. This procedure is the one that is applied in the

imulation of metal cutting processes. 

. Description of the thermo-mechanical problem 

Next we are going to describe the main equations describing

he Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP), the variables that must

e considered and as well as all terms and factors that we will

eed to solve it. This description is performed inside the theory of

ontinuum mechanics.

3.2. Stabilization of the mixed displacement-pressure equation 

The monolithic approach of the mixed displacement-pressure

problem, Eq. (2) , fails to satisfy the inf-sup condition when equal

order interpolants are used for both displacement and pressure

fields. When the order of interpolation of the pressure field of the

finite element is the same as the order of interpolation of the dis-

placement field, the solution presents nonphysical oscillations. 

Several techniques have been developed to address this prob-

lem, among them: The Characteristic Based Split (CBS) ( Chorin,

1997 ), the finite calculus (FIC) ( Onate et al., 2004 ), the Orthogonal

Subgrid Scales (OSS) ( Saracibar et al., 2006; Chiumenti et al., 2002;

2003 ) and the Polynomial Pressure Projection (PPP) ( Dohrmann

and Bochev, 2004; Bochev et al., 2008 ). 

The so-called Polynomial Pressure Projection(PPP) technique is

used in this work because it can be implemented in an elementary

level surpassing the need of mesh dependent and problem depen-

dent parameters (more information is given in Appendix B .

. Constitutive modelling of a metal-like material 

The type of modelling that we are going to analyze in this work

eeds for the treatment of plasticity. The elastic behaviour is con-

idered non-linear and the thermal effects, like the generation of

eat, must also be taken into account in the constitutive law. 

.1. Thermo-hyperelastoplasticity at finite strains 

The starting model is an hyperelastic model under temperature

ffects. We must consider material isotropy and assume that also

n the thermal response. Volumetric changes in the constitutive re-

ponse must be accounted due to the variation of the temperature

n the material. 

The Neo-Hookean material used to represent the phenomenol-

gy mentioned above is represented with the following free energy

unction, (see Bonet and Wood (1997) ; Simo (1988a ). 

(b ) = U(J) + W (b ) + M(θ, J) (5)
The elastic part of the free energy is uncoupled into volumet-

ic/deviatoric response described by the functions U ( J ) and W ( C ),

espectively. The function M ( θ , J ) describes the thermo-mechanical
oupling due to thermal expansion and provides the potential for

he associated elastic structural entropy. 

Consistent with the assumption of isotropy and extending the

yperelastic model to plasticity we characterize the stress response

y a stored energy with the form 

 = U(J e ) + W ( ̄b e ) + M(θ, J e ) + T (θ ) + K( ̄e p , θ ) (6)
In this case the function T ( θ ) is the potential for the purely

hermal entropy. The function K( ̄e 
p 
, θ ) is a nonlinear function of

he equivalent plastic strain ē 
p 

and temperature θ which describes
he isotropic strain hardening via the relation β = −∂ ē p K( ̄e 

p 
, θ ) . To

ake matters as concrete as possible, we consider the following

xplicit forms ( Simo and Miehe, 1992; Čanadija and Brni ́c, 2004 ).

.2. Yield condition 

Accurate flow stress models are considered extremely nec-

ssary to represent work material constitutive behavior under

igh strain rate deformation conditions. We consider the classical

ises–Hubber yield conditions, expressed in terms of the Kirchhoff

tress tensor, for the case of rate independent plasticity: 

(τ, ̄e 
p 
, θ ) = ‖ dev (τ ) ‖ −

( σy + β) g( ˙ ē

(9) 

here σ y denotes the flow stress, β = −K ′ ( ̄e p , θ ) the isotropic
onlinear hardening modulus, g( ̇ ē 

p 
) the strain rate hardening

odulus. The expressions (σy + β) y and g( ̇ ē 
p 
) depend on the

ardening law used. Numerous empirical and semi-empirical flow

tress models have been proposed. The strain-rate dependent

odel developed by Johnson and Cook (1983) and the rate in-

ependent model developed by Voce (1955) will be used in this

ork. 

.3. Isotropic hardening laws 

In a typical machining event, very high strain rates in excess of

0 5 may be attained within the primary shear zone, while the re-

ainder of the workpiece deforms at moderate or low strain rates.

 simple model which accounts for this behavior is the Johnson

nd Cook strength model. For the sake of comparison, next we

resent the rate independent hardening law developed by Voce

1955) and rate dependent hardening law developed by Johnson 

nd Cook . Both hardening laws are usually applied in the numer-

cal simulation of machining processes. 

.3.1. Voce strength model 

Voce (1955) proposed an exponential form of hardening. This

ssumes that the hardening eventually reaches a specified satura-

ion (or maximum) stress. The strain hardening law interrelating

rue stress σ y and true plastic strain ε̄ p is expressed as 

( σy + β) = ( K inf − ( K inf − σ0 ) e −δε̄ p + H ̄ε ) ∗ (1 −w 0 (θ−θ0 )) (10)
here K inf is the saturation stress, σ 0 is the true stress at the onset

f plastic deformation and H is the linear hardening modulus. The

onstant δ determines the rate at which the stress σ 0 moves from
ts initial value tends to reach steady state or saturation stress K inf .

he material property w 0 describes the thermal softening of the

aterial of interest. The dependency of the hardening law on the

emperature represents the softening of the material when its tem-

erature is increased. The Voce model describes the strain harden-

ng and thermal softening of most steels in the temperature range
0 0K to 40 0K and at low strain rates. Extended information can be

ound in Simo and Miehe (1992) . 

A material model that describes the behavior of metal in a wide

ange of temperatures, strain and strain rates is explained in the

ext. 

.3.2. Johnson-Cook strength model 

The Johnson-Cook strength model is a phenomenological model.

nder certain conditions, the flow stress of some materials was ob-

erved to behave in a manner that could be described reasonably

ell by particular mathematical forms. The Johnson-Cook model

escribes the flow of the material as the product of three math-

matical terms with A , the initial yield strength of the material at

oom temperature and a reference strain rate. 

( σy + β) = A 
(

1 + B 
A 

ε n 
)(

1 + C ln ˙ ε ′ 
)
(1 − θ ′ m ) (11) 

Here, ε is the equivalent plastic strain, ˙ ε 
′ 

is the strain rate non-

imensionalized by the reference strain rate, and B, C, m and n are

tting constants. It is important to remark that, that if n = 1 , m =
 and C = 0 , the Johnson-Cook material model recovers the Voce
odel. 

.4. Associative flow rule 

The functional form of the corresponding associate flow

ule is uniquely determined analyzing the evolution equations

nd the plastic dissipation. For the Mises–Hubber yield function

9) and the free energy function (6) , Simo and Miehe (1992) and

brahimbegovic and Chorfi (2002) show that the flow rule takes

he form based on the principle of maximum plastic dissipation.

 summary of the J 2 -plastic flow model with isotropic harden-

ng is shown in Box 2 . In this model, we assume that the defor-

ation gradient F admit a multiplicative decomposition in elastic

nd plastic parts, F = F e F p , respectively. The elastic response is ex-
ressed in terms of b e = F e F e T , where b e is the elastic left Cauchy–
reen deformation tensor. 

The main equations for the constitutive model introduced

ere will be integrated using a new scheme for thermo-

yperelastoplasticity called Impl-Ex scheme, see Oliver et al.

2008) . 

.5. Time integration of the constitutive law: The IMPL-EX integration

cheme 

In this section we focus in the problem of integrating numer-

cally the initial-value ODE equations configured by the Evolution

quations and the Kuhn–Tucker conditions (see Box 2 ). 

The implicit Backward-Euler method is the most commonly

sed integration scheme for plasticity (see Simo (1988a ); 1988b );

imo and Hughes (1998) ) . Although the convergence of the inte-

ration is guaranteed, the fully implicit integration of the constitu-

ive law requires some relevant computational effort and can expe-

ience some numerical problems of robustness when the material

ailure appears. 

To improve the performance in the integration of the constitu-

ive law, we introduce the integration of the constitutive law by

eans of the Impl-Ex scheme. Next, we develop the Impl-Ex inte-

ration for the thermo-hyperelastoplastic constitutive model used

n this work. 

We simply choose the variable to be treated explicitly and the

tress update algorithm arising from this choice must be derived.

y definition, the equivalent plastic strain is a monotonically in-

reasing function of time, ˙ ē p ≥ 0 . For this reason, it is a logical can-
idate to be treated explicitly, since its evolution can be predicted

more accurately than other variables exhibiting non-monotonic be-

havior. 

Using the Taylor expansion of the equivalent plastic strain at

 n −1 around t n we can find an explicit extrapolation formula of the
equivalent plastic strain. Expression (12) constitutes an explicit ex-

trapolation of the equivalent plastic strain at t n +1 in terms of the
implicit values computed at t n and t n −1 .

The Impl-Ex algorithm is a multistep method, since two points

are used to advance the solution in time to point t n +1 . 
The algorithmic plastic multiplier resulting from this extrapola-

ion reads: 

˜ λn +1 =

Expression (13) reveals that the elastic or plastic nature of the

esponse predicted by the Impl-Ex integration scheme at t n +1 is
ictated by the response computed implicitly at t n . This may give

ise to overshoots and oscillations in the transitions from elastic to

nelastic and vice versa, but if a time step is small enough as is

sually in metal cutting simulations or a time step control is used,

his worrying effect does not occur. In Rodriguez et al. (2016) , the

Compared to regular initial boundary value problems, spe-

ial boundary constraints are imposed in contact problems which

govern the interface motion and possible singularities. For classi-

cal contact problems the constraints express non-penetration (uni-

lateral) condition, third Newton’s law and law of surface friction.

The normal contact condition prevents the penetration of one body

into another and the tangential slip represents frictional behavior

of a contact surface. There are various approaches established for

resolving the contact problem. One of these techniques applied for

imposing contact conditions in the normal direction is the formu-

lation of non-penetration condition, as a purely geometrical con-

straint. 

In this work we have used two different approaches, in the first

one the tool is considered rigid allowing for a simple and robust

treatment of the mechanical contact (usually frictionless). In the

second approach the tool is considered deformable. The mechani-

cal contact will take into account friction and the treatment of the

thermal phenomena occurring at the contact interface. 

In both cases contact constraints are implemented based on the

penalty approach by imposing the normal springs at the contact

interface. 

5.1. Rigid tool contact 

The first approach to take into account the interaction between

a cutter and a workpiece is to consider the tool as a rigid element

and the workpiece as deformable body. If the cutter is rigid, the

geometry of that element is not going to change during the con-

tact. The best way to describe a fixed geometry is using the math-

ematical description of its boundary. That allows us to avoid the

drawbacks coming from the treatment of contact with a wall of

finite elements. 

The contact between finite elements require a more complex

geometrical contact search and an special master-slave structure.

There is usually a lack of continuity from one element to another

that comes from the finite element discretization. That fact degra-

dates the convergence of the solution because non-smooth contact

forces are obtained from the computation of the constraint in a

discrete interface. 

The first step for a good definition of the contact forces is a

good characterization of the contacting geometry. This will be done

using a parametrization of the tool surface. The second step is the

mathematical description of the contact constraint. Once an active

set of contacts are determined, that constraint is included in the

linear momentum balance equation. 

5.1.1. Parametrization of the contact tool surface 

The geometrical scheme considered to describe a cutting tool

can be characterized with three parameters: the tip radius, the an-

gle of the rake face (rake angle) and the angle of the flank face

(clearance angle) (see Fig. 4 ). Defining these three parameters a

circle (or a cylinder in 3D) and two planes tangent to that cir-

cle are mathematically determined. For the contact detection, one

must also define the exterior side of the tool. When a particle of

the deformable domain is going to exceed the described contour

that particle will be in contact with the tool. 

5.1.2. Normal contact with a rigid tool 

The definition of the outward normal direction n will be given

by the mathematical equation characterizing the rigid tool surface.

Once a particle enters in contact with one of the surfaces the nor-

mal gap g N will be computed projecting the exceeding distance

vector into that normal. Using a penalty approach, the constitutive

equation for the normal force P N is given by 

P N = κg N (14)
where the κ is the penalty parameter. The contact constraint con-
tribution for the weak form of the linear momentum equation is
iven by 
 

�cont 

w i P N n i d�cont = P N n (15)

The tangential contact can also be considered in the same way

s the normal contact. Projecting the particles exceeding distance

ector in the tangent direction defined by the rigid surfaces, the

angential gap is determined. Applying a friction law the force

agnitude is determined (see Section 5.2.2 for slip conditions) and

an be added to the contact constraint. 

.2. Deformable tool contact 

In order to extend the contact modeling possibilities the tool

ust be considered deformable. In this case the interaction is more

xpensive because both contacting surfaces are susceptible to de-

orm. The contact is governing the interface motion introducing a

ew non-linearity to the system. The normal contact condition is

onsidered to prevent the penetration of one body into another

nd for the tangential direction, elastic-plastic constitutive laws

ill be used to distinguish the sticking and sliding states. 

In sticking interfaces, either a geometrical constraint equation,

r a constitutive law for the tangential relative micro displace-

ents between the contacting bodies can be applied. For tangen-

ial sliding between bodies, a special constitutive equation for fric-

ion must be employed. 

In this study, a penalty approach is implemented for the tan-

ential case. The stiffness of the tangential spring will be modified

ccording to a regularized Coulomb friction law. 

.2.1. Normal contact 

The node-to-segment (NTS) contact element is one of the most

ommonly used discretization in large deformation simulations of

ontact problems ( de Saracibar, 1998; Wriggers and Simo, 1985 ).

.2.2. Tangential contact: Friction laws 

Let us introduce the discrete relative tangential velocity 

˙ 
 T = ( ̄ξ − ξ̄0 ) l/ �t (24)
nd the discrete relative tangent displacement 

 T = ( ̄ξ − ξ̄0 ) l (25)
here ξ̄0 is the projection of the slave node on the master surface

t the beginning of the time step. 

The friction force is modeled using a regularized Coulomb fric-

ion law as follows 

 T = μP N tanh 
(

˙ g T 
V re f 

)
(26) 

here μ is the friction coefficient between the workpiece and the
ool and V ref is a regularization parameter. As V ref tends to 0 the

egularized friction law tends to the Coulomb friction Law. In the

imulation presented in this work, a value of 1mm/s has been

sed. The contribution of the friction force to the balance of mo-

entum take the form 

 u ,cont (u ) = P T T s (27) 
here the vector T s is given by 

 s =

The solution of the balance of momentum equation using New-

on’s method need the linearization of the normal and tangential

ontact forces, to see the derivation of this matrices (see Rodriguez

t al. (2015) ). 

.2.3. Heat transfer at the contact interface 

The heart flux at the contact zone needs a constitutive equation

or its determination. We assume the following structure for the

onstitutive equation of the heat flux 

 = hg T (29) 
here 

 T = (θ (1) s − (1 − ξ̄ ) θ (2) 1 − ξ̄ θ
(2) 
2 

) (30)

here h is the thermal conductance coefficient. The heat flux Q

odels at the tool-chip interface the heat conduction through

pots, heat conduction trough the gas contained cavities and radia-

ion between micro-cavities surfaces. As a result, the heat transfer

oefficient h is usually assumed to depend on contact pressure and

emperature. In this work, we assume the heat transfer coefficient

onstant. 

The contribution to the balance of energy due to conduction,

onvection and radiation is given bay 

 θ,cont (θ ) = Q�Q (31) 
here the vector T s is given by 

Q = 

⎡ 
⎣

⎦ (32) 

When two bodies, say a tool and a workpiece, are in contact,

he rate at which heat is generated due to friction is shared be-

ween both bodies. In this work, we suppose that the half the

eat is entering the tool and half is entering to the workpiece. For

ore sophisticated models of the heat partition due to friction (see

o decouple it in two simpler problems. The isothermal scheme

resented in Simo and Miehe (1992) decouples the thermo-

echanical problem in two simple problems, but, yet, the mechan-

cal problem is coupled with the evolution equations of the inter-

al variables and the thermal problem is also coupled. The evolu-

hrough the plastic multiplier. The above reason, suggests decou-

ling the problem in the following three simple problems: (i) an

lastic problem with shear modulus changing from element to ele-

ent, (ii) a thermal problem with a temperature dependent plastic

eat source and (iii) a relaxation process affecting the stress and

he internal variables at the integration points. 

In this section, we present a new staggered algorithm for the

olution of the IBVP, which is based on the isothermal split pre-

ented in Simo and Miehe (1992) and the Impl-Ex integration

cheme of the constitutive equations presented in Oliver et al.

2008) . Using the ingredients presented above, the solution of the

oupled system of ODE (37), (36) and (38) could be decoupled in

he three simple problems mentioned previously. In addition, the

lastic and the thermal problems update the internal variables ac-

ording to a predicted plastic multiplier (explicit), while the con-

titutive equations keep the displacements, velocities and temper-

tures unchanged (implicit). 

For simplicity, a partition of the time domain I := [0, T ] into N
ime steps, of the same length �t is considered. Let us focus on the

ime step t n → t n +1 , where �t = t n +1 − t n . An implicit backward-
uler difference scheme is applied to the momentum equation and

o the energy equation. In the first step the extrapolation of the

lastic multiplier �λn +1 = �λn is done. Consequently, the stresses
n +1 are computed via in Impl-Ex integration scheme of the con-

titutive equation. After that, the balance of momentum (4) is

olved implicitly providing the nodal displacement and pressure

or fixed initial temperature. The balance of momentum equations,

roviding a fixed initial temperature and an extrapolated value of

he internal variables, constitutes a non-linear system to solve. In

his case, the non-linearity of the system appears due to the geo-

etrical part of the linearized equations. Therefore they have to be

teratively solved until convergence is achieved. 

The solution of the balance of momentum equation for a

xed initial temperature gives an update of the primary variables

 n +1 , p n +1 and a first update of the internal variables. Then, in the
econd step, the solution of the balance of energy with initial con-

itions u n +1 , p n +1 , θn , initial internal variables b e n , ̄e

n and the

xtrapolation of the plastic multiplier �λn +1 = �λn gives an up-
ate of the primary variable θn +1 and a second update of the in-
ernal plastic variables (at fixed configuration). Finally, in the third

tep, the values of u n +1 , p n +1 , θn +1 remain fixed, and an implicit
ackward-Euler integration of the constitutive model ( Simo and

iehe (1992) ) is done using as initial internal variables b e n , ̄e

It is interesting to note that the boundary values of the mo-

entum equation are included in the elastic equations with shear

odulus changing from element to element and the boundary val-

es of the balance of energy are imposed on the thermal problem

ith temperature dependent plastic heat source. In addition, the

lasticity law integration consists on solving a collection of sys-

ems of ordinary differential equations, each one of them belong-

ng to a different integration point. A full Newton–Raphson scheme

s used for the solution of the non-linear systems. 

. Examples 

In next section different exam ples are presented concerning to

he simulation of linear cutting tests. Each one of them has a par-

icular set of cutting properties and material models. Fig. 6 shows

he general scheme for the model of a linear cutting test example.

n each case the proper numerical techniques have been applied

n order to reproduce the continuous cut. We start with two ex-

mples where the tool is rigid, the contact is frictionless and the

onstitutive model is changed from a rate-independent to a rate-

ependent plasticity law. We change also the angle of the tool to

etect its influence in the analysis results. 

In the next cases, a rate-dependent law and a deformable tool

s considered. In the first one, the heat transfer between the work-

iece and the tool is neglected and the contact is considered fric-

ionless. After analyzing the influence of the introduced changes on

he results we study a second example. In this one the friction and

he transfer of heat between the tool and the workpiece is consid-

red. The heat produced in the contact interface by the friction of

aterials is also taken into account.

avior is given by a Voce law 4.3.1 that takes into account thermal

oftening (see Table 1 ). Conductivity and specific heat does not de-

end on temperature, we consider them constant. The following

umption that the tool is rigid is reasonable, since the deformation

f the tool is secondary relatively to the excessive plastic deforma-

ion of the workpiece. 

Temperature, effective plastic strain rate and von Mises contours

re presented in Fig. 7 . von Mises stress, shown in Fig. 7 , demon-

trates that relatively high stresses arise in the primary shear zone

nd at the tool chip interface. The localization of this zone agrees

ith simplified models, but it differs in that the maximum stress

s not confined to only a plane of excessive shear. It is also impor-

ant to note the development of residual stresses at and below the

urface of the produced new surface and in the upper part of the

hip, especially near the tool-chip interface where unloading due

o curling of the chip occurred. The effective strain rate in the pri-

ary and the secondary shear zone is of the order of 10 · 10 5 s −1 
nd has its highest value close to the tool tip. 

Finally, in Fig. 7 , the temperature distribution is shown in the

aterial behavior is given by a Johnson Cook law that takes into

ccount thermal softening and strain rate hardening Table 2 . Con-

uctivity and specific heat does not depend on temperature, we

onsider them constant. The following assumptions are made: the

ool is supposed to be rigid and friction is neglected. Furthermore,

he thermal exchange between the block and the tool are also ne-

lected. The inertia of the block is neglected. Implicit dynamics

s used. Time steps were of 1 . 041 · 10 −7 s which takes 3.6 · 10 3 
teps for a tool travel of 1.24 mm.As described, the example has
ssentially the same parameters as the previous one excluding the

ate dependent yield function. The number of particles used to dis-

retize the workpiece was between 6531 and 7806. Only insertion

f particles was used for this example. 

Looking at the results, the deformation is largely confined to

he primary shear zone and to the boundary layer adjacent to the

ool Fig. 9 . No shear localization occurs and a continuous chip

ormation is predicted. A typical distribution of temperature field

ithin the workpiece material is shown in Fig. 9 . Highest temper-

tures are observed on the outside surface of the chip currently

n contact with the rake face. Temperature in the direction of the

hear plane is found to vary from high of about 810 K near the

utting edge to about 510 K near the unmachined free surface. Also

emperature along the rake face changes from 810 K near the cut-

ing edge to 760 K at the point where the contact between the tool

nd the chip come to an end. 

.2.1. Linear cutting test changing the angle of the rigid tool 

In this example the previous simulation is modeled changing

nly the rigid tool geometry. The change is only applied in the

ake angle which is considered, in this case, of 6 °. The number
f particles used to discretize the workpiece was between 6529

nd 7682. The material behavior of the workpiece is described by a

Johnson Cook law taking into account thermal softening and strain

rate hardening, and using the parameters of Table 2 . 

In this case, deformation is largely confined to the primary

shear zone and to the boundary layer adjacent to the tool Fig. 11 ,

as occurred in the other examples. No shear localization occurs

and a continuous chip formation is predicted. A typical distribu-

tion of temperature field within the workpiece material is shown

in Fig. 11 . Highest temperatures are observed at the outside surface

of the chip currently in contact with the rake face. Temperature in

the direction of the shear plane varies from 790 K near the cutting

edge to about 500 K near the unmachined free surface. Also tem-

perature along the rake face changes from 790 K near the cutting

edge to 750 K at the point where the contact between the tool and

the chip comes to an end. 

The largest accumulated plastic strains occur within the bound-

ary layer adjacent to the tool. In this region, the flow of the mate-

rial is facilitated by thermal softening and the plastic strains attain

values up to 4. Strains in the interior of the chip remain between

1 to 1.5 upon exit from the primary shear zone. Fig. 12 shows the

horizontal and vertical predicted cutting forces. It is found that

horizontal cutting force rise quickly to a value of 170 N per mm of

width of cut within a short distance of 0.05 mm. Then as the chip

thickness and the cutting temperatures in the deforming zone sta-

bilize, the horizontal cutting force holds to this constant value of

170 N per mm width of cut. The steady state vertical force compo-

nent, also known as thrust force was found to average around 48,

N per mm width of cut. The contact length between the tool and

the workpiece, the deformed chip thickness and the shear angle

are 0.15 mm, 0.16 mm and 30 °, respectively. 

7.3. Linear cutting test with a frictionless deformable tool and a rate 

dependent law 

The next example concerns the cutting of a rectangular block

of high strength AISI 4340 steel modeled using the Johnson-Cook

hardening law with the tool considered as a deformable body.

From now on, the deformable contact will be considered increasing

the complexity of the contact interaction in each one of the exam-

ples. In the former one the hypothesis considered is the closest to

the rigid tool cases (frictionless without heat transfer). 

The tool has a clearance angle of 5 °, a rake angle of 0 ° and
a tool radius of 0.025 mm. The friction and the thermal exchange

between the workpiece and the tool are neglected. The materi-

als and processes parameters are collected in Table 2 . Conductivity

and specific heat of the workpiece and the tool do not depend on

temperature, we consider them constant. Workpiece dimensions

were taken as 7.0 mm (length) 3.6 mm (depth). Cutting speed was

3.33 m/s and the deep of cut was 0.1 mm. The deformable tool ge-

ometry is depicted in Fig. 13 . 

Each time increment was designed to correspond to a tool

travel of 3 . 47218 · 10 −4 mm. Simulation was continued until the
chip comes into contact with the tool. Actually a tool travel of

1.166 mm was covered in 3.360 · 10 3 implicit increments. The num-
ber of particles used to discretize the workpiece was between 7957

and 9105. 

Fig. 14 shows the contours of equivalent plastic strain rate and

the contours of equivalent von Mises stress. It is observed that the

maximum values of equivalent plastic strain rate and von Mises

stress occur near the cutting edge and are of the order of 2.58 ·
10 5 s −1 and 1080 MPa respectively. 

In Fig. 15 a comparison between the predicted forces using a

deformable and a rigid tool is shown, it can be observed that

the obtained cutting and feed forces are close to be the same

in both cases. Nevertheless, according to our testing experience,

if the mesh size and the time step are smaller a slightly lower

cutting force and slightly higher feed force is obtained when the
eformable tool is used, although a specific study is necessary to

robe the last sentence. This occurs due to the change in the local

utting edge geometry (see Rodriguez et al. (2015) ). 

The contact length between the tool and the workpiece, the de-

ormed chip thickness and the shear angle are 0.16 mm, 0.14 mm

nd 30 °, respectively. The modelling the deformation of the tool
s relevant for example for tool industries, because they want to

now where and how failure take place, and one relevant indi-

ator for that is the place where the maximum von Mises stress

akes place in the tool. 

.4. Linear cutting test with a deformable tool and a rate dependent 

aw considering friction and heat transfer 

In this example, orthogonal dry machining of AISI 4340 steel by

 high strength steel tool has been simulated. The cutting is per-

ormed at a speed of 3.33 m/s, at a feed of 0.1 mm, a rake angle of

 ° and a clearance angle of 5 °. The friction at the tool-chip inter-
ace is modeled using a regularized Coulomb friction law presented

n Section 5.2.2 with frictional coefficient μ = 0 . 2 . The mechanical
nd thermal properties of the workpiece and the tool are the same

hat were used in previous example. The number of particles used

o discretize the workpiece was between 7957 and 9084. 

The thermal properties of the tool are supposed to be matched

o those of the workpiece, giving an equal portion of frictional heat

llowed for the tool and the chip. The thermal conductance coef-

cient used was 1 e 9 W/m 2 K, in order to ensure that the thermal

ap at the tool-chip interface will be negligible. 

Fig. 16 shows the results for the strain rate contours. Strains are

oncentrated, as expected, near the shear plane and along the rake

ace. The strain rate reaches 1.35 · 10 5 s −1 in front of the cutting
dge. 

The temperature field in the tool and the workpiece is also de-

icted in Fig. 16 . The maximum temperature is 961 K and takes

lace along the rake face. In the same figure, the plastic-strain

istribution reaches extremely high values, in some points of the

nalysis they are close to 14. The von Mises stress distribution is

lso shown in Fig. 16 , the maximum stress appears in the tool,

lose to the cutting edge. In the workpiece, the magnitude of the

tress rises in the deformation zone because of the material hard-

ning, but it is limited to 1250 MPa by thermal softening. 

The contact length between the tool and the workpiece, the de-

ormed chip thickness and the shear angle are 0.19 mm, 0.18 mm

nd 29 °, respectively. 
A comparison with the frictionless case of the previous exam-

le (7.3) is presented in Fig. 17 . The comparison shows that the

utting force increases 40 N/mm while the thrust force increases

6 N/mm if friction is considered. Similarly, the contact length and

he undeformed chip thickness increase with friction. The reason

or these increases cater to the fact that friction hinders the rota-

ional movement of the chip during the cut. 

.5. Validation and competitiveness 

In order to validate PFEM strategy with a test case, a cut-

ing process of 42CD4 steel at 300 m/min, with a tool radius of

.04 mm, a rake angle of 6 ° and a cutting depth of 0.2 mm is pro-
osed. Materials and contact properties used are the same pre-
ented in Arrazola (2003) . A summary of all the input parameters

re found in Tables 3 , 4 and 5 . 

The time step used during the simulation was 1 . 1 · 10 −8 s, as a
esult 20 0 0 0 time steps were needed for a tool displacement of

 mm. At the beginning of the cutting process the workpiece was

iscretized with 422 particles, due to the insertion of the particles

he maximum number reached was 11386. 

Fig. 18 shows the temperature field after a cutting length of

mm. The maximum tool temperature reached is about 1186 K. It

s located far from the cutting edge, and approximately at a dis-

ance of 1.25 times the undeformed chip thickness. The maximum

on Mises stress inside the chip-piece takes place in the primary

to the point where the tool loses the contact with the machined

surface. 

Data about experimental results have been obtained from data

reported in the literature ( Arrazola, 2003 ). Table 6 compares the

numerical and the experimental results obtained for the exam-

ple presented in this section. It is observed a good agreement be-

tween the experimental and the numerical cutting forces however

there are large differences between experimental and numerical

feed forces. Regarding the chip thickness a relatively good agree-

ment was found between experiments and numerical simulations.

Looking at the same table ( Table 6 ), the tool-chip contact length
easured in the experiments is about two times greater than the

ength predicted by the numerical simulations. The differences be-

ween the numerical and the experimental results come from two

ources: 1) the experiments used to calibrate the Johnson-Cook

aw are carried out at strain rates lower than the strain rates ob-

ained in machining process and 2) the friction modeling at the

ool shape does not follow the Coulomb law (see Svoboda et al.

2010) ; Arrazola et al. (2008) ; Filice et al. (2006) ; Özel (2006) .

rrazola et al. (2008) , report that the main differences observed

etween FEM results and experimental ones are the feed force and

he tool-chip contact length, where differences of more that 50%

an be found for those variables when comparing FEM results with

he experimental ones. According to Arrazola et al. (2008) the mis-

atch in feed force between experimental and numerical ones can

e reduced using an improved friction law. The implementation of

 new friction law is out of the scope of the present work).

The discrepancies detected between the experimental results

nd the numerical results from the PFEM are not out of the or-

inary if we compare with the results obtained with commercial

odes (see Rodriguez et al. (2013) for a comparison between PFEM

nd some commercial codes). 

. Conclusions 

In this work we have assembled several numerical techniques

ithin the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) in order to face

he simulation of continuous chip formation in metal cutting pro-

esses. The presented extension of the PFEM includes the use of

arge strain J 2 plasticity with non-linear thermal softening, a novel

mplicit-Explicit ( Impl-Ex ) solver for the thermo-mechanical cou-

led problem, and a continuous reconnection of the particles in its

pdated configuration using Delaunay triangulation. The new in-

redients also include the treatment of the contact with rigid and

eformable tools considering a full frictional thermo-mechanical

oupling. As a result of the combination of these techniques the

FEM is now able to handle the modelling of metal cutting pro-

esses which presents a good agreement with experimental tests

nd a good performance compared with other simulation tech-

iques. 

The merits of the formulation in terms of its general applica-

ility have been demonstrated with the analysis of four represen-

ative numerical simulations of 2D orthogonal cutting tests. These

imulations provide results on chip thickness, contact length, cut-

ing and feed forces, distribution of the strain rate, strains, tem-

eratures, and von Mises stress. Experimentally, it is very costly

nd difficult to measure stresses and temperatures in machining.

herefore the results presented in this work offer an advance in

he knowledge of the mechanics of chip formation. The performed

tudy evaluates the effects of different process parameters such as

aterial properties, material constitutive laws and tool geometries.

he results show good agreement when are compared with some

xperimental measures of important interest for the performance

f the cutting process. These findings place the PFEM as an excel-

ent candidate for modeling machining problems. 

cknowledgements 

The research leading to these results has received funding from

nth Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement

ppendix A. Basic steps of the PFEM 

In the PFEM the continuum are modelled using an Updated La-

rangian formulation. This description uses an incremental update

f the body configuration. That is, all variables are assumed to be

nown in the current configuration at time t . The new set of vari-

bles is sought for in the next or updated configuration at time

 + �t . The finite element method (FEM) is used to solve the con-
inuum equations. Hence a mesh discretizing the domain must be

enerated in order to solve the governing equations in the standard

EM fashion. 

Recall that the nodes discretizing the analysis domain are

reated as material particles which motion is tracked during the

ransient solution. This is useful to model the separation of parti-

les from the main domain such as fracture of the chip in metal

utting problems, and to follow their subsequent motion as indi-

idual particles with a known density, an initial acceleration and

elocity and subject to gravity forces. The mass of a given do-

ain is obtained by integrating the density at the different ma-

erial points over a domain calculation mesh. Therefore quality of
he numerical solution depends on the discretization chosen as in

he standard FEM. Within the re-connection of the particles that

s performed to obtain the calculation mesh, adaptive mesh refine-

ent techniques will be used to improve the resultant distribution.

For clarity purposes we will define the process starting with the

ollection or cloud of nodes (C) pertaining to the analysis domain,

he volume (V) defining the analysis domain and the mesh (M) dis-

retizing the domain. 

A typical solution with the PFEM involves the following steps. 

1. Definition of the domain(s) �n in the last converged configura-

tion, t = n t, keeping existing spatial discretization �̄n . 
2. Transference of variables by a smoothing process from Gauss

points to nodes. 

3. Discretization of the given domain(s) in a set of particles of in-

finitesimal size elimination of existing connectivities �̄n . 

4. Reconstruction of the mesh through a triangulation of the do-

mains convex-hull and the definition of the boundary applying

the α-shape method ( Edelsbrunner and Mucke, 1994 ), defining
a new spatial discretization. 

5. A contact method to recognize the multibody interaction. 

6. Transference of information, interpolating nodal variables into

the Gauss points. 

7. Solution of the system of equations for n +1 t = n t + �t . 
8. Go back to step 1 and repeat the solution process for the next

time step. 

ppendix B. The Polynomial pressure projection 

The PPP uses a projection on a discontinuous space and as a

onsequence it does not require specification of a mesh dependent

tabilization parameter or calculation of higher-order derivatives. 

The implementation of the PPP reduces to a simple modifica-

ion of the weak continuity equation (incompressibility constraint).

n this work, we use the PPP to solid mechanics problems involv-

ng large strains. 

Given a function p ∈ L 2 , the L 2 projection operator p̆ : L 2 → Q 0 
s defined by 
 

V t 

q̆ (p − p̆ ) d V t = 0 ∀ ̆q ∈ Q 0 (39)
here p̆ is the best approximation of the pressure p in the space

f polynomials of order O(Q 0 ) . V t is the volume of the domain at
he current configuration. To stabilize the mixed form given by Eqs.

2 ), we add the projection operator to the second equation in (2) 
 

V t 

(q − q̆ ) αs 
μ

(p − p̆ ) d V t = 0 (40)

here αs is the stabilization parameter and μ is the material shear
odulus.
