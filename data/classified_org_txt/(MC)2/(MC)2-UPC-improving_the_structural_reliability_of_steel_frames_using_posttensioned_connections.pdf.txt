In this paper, various moment-resisting steel frames (MRSFs) are subjected to 30 narrow-band motions scaled at different ground
motion intensity levels in terms of spectral acceleration at first mode of vibration Sa(T1) in order to perform incremental dynamic
analysis for peak and residual interstory drift demands.*e results are used to compute the structural reliability of the steel frames
by means of hazard curves for peak and residual drifts. It is observed that the structures exceed the threshold residual drift of 0.5%,
which is perceptible to human occupants, and it could lead to human discomfort according to recent investigations. For this
reason, posttensioned connections (PTCs) are incorporated into the steel frames in order to improve the structural reliability. *e
results suggest that the annual rate of exceedance of peak and residual interstory drift demands are reduced with the use of PTC.
*us, the structural reliability of the steel frames with PTC is superior to that of the MRSFs. In particular, the residual drift
demands tend to be smaller when PTCs are incorporated in the steel structures.

1. Introduction

Currently, most of the seismic design regulations recommend
the use of maximum interstory drift as the main engineering
demand parameter. Nevertheless, earthquake field re-
connaissance has evidenced that residual drift demands after
an earthquake play an important role in the seismic per-
formance of a structure. For example, several dozen damaged
reinforced concrete structures in Mexico City had to be
demolished after the 1985 Michoacan earthquake because of
the technical difficulties to straighten and to repair buildings
with large permanent drifts [1]. Okada et al. [2] reported that
several low-rise RC buildings suffered light structural damage
but experienced relatively large residual deformations as a
consequence of the 1995Hyogo-KenNambu earthquake even

though they had sufficient deformation capacity. After ex-
amining 12 low-to-mid-rise steel office buildings (particularly
10 with structural system based on steel moment-resisting
frames) structurally damaged and leaned after the same
earthquake, Iwata et al. [3] highlighted that the cost of repair
of leaned steel buildings linearly increased as the maximum
and roof residual drift increased. Based on their study, the
authors suggested that steel buildings should be limited to
maximum and roof residual drift about 1.4% and 0.9%, re-
spectively, to satisfy a repairability limit state that meets both
technical and economical constraints. More recently, a field
investigation in Japan indicated that a residual interstory drift
of about 0.5% is perceptible for building occupants [4].
Bojórquez and Ruiz-Garćıa [5] by comparing peak and re-
sidual drift demand hazard curves have observed that if steel

frames exhibit peak drift demands about 3%, they could
experience residual drifts larger than 0.5%, which is the
threshold residual drift that could be tolerable to human
occupants, and it could lead to human discomfort [4] when
subjected to narrow-band earthquake groundmotions of high
intensity. *erefore, several researchers have demonstrated
that the estimation of residual drift demands should also play
an important role during the design of new buildings [6–8]
and the evaluation of the seismic structural performance of
existing buildings [9–13].

In the present study, motivated by the need to reduce peak
and residual interstory drift demands, PTCs are incorporated
into various MRSFs. Posttensioned steel moment-resisting
frames are structural systems proposed in recent years as an
appropriate alternative to welded connections of moment-
resisting frames in seismic zones [14–27]. *ey are designed
to prevent brittle fractures in the area of the nodes of steel
frames, which can cause severe reduction in their ductility
capacity, as occurred in many cases during the 1994
Northridge and the 1995 Kobe earthquakes. *e philosophy
of structures with PTC is that under an intense earthquake
motion, beams and columns remain essentially elastic con-
centrating the damage on the energy dissipating elements,
which can be easily replaced at low cost. Moreover, they
provide capacity of energy dissipation and self-centering
which can significantly reduce the residual demands. *e
structural performance of the selected MRSFs is compared
with the structures with PTC through incremental dynamic
analysis and the estimation of the structural reliability of the
frames in terms of peak and residual interstory drift demands.
With this aim, four MRSFs and the same structures with PTC
(here named FPTC frames with posttensioned connections)
are subjected to 30 long-duration groundmotions recorded at
the lake zone of Mexico City where most of the damages were
found in buildings as a consequence of the 1985 Michoacan
earthquake. In general, it is observed that the structural re-
liability of the steel frames with PTC is superior to that of the
MRSFs. In particular, the residual drift demands tend to be
smaller than 0.5% (which is perceptible for building occu-
pants) when PTCs are incorporated into the steel structures.

2. Methodology

2.1. Structural Steel Frame Models. Two groups of four
structural steel frame models are selected for the study. *e
first group of structures corresponding to moment-resisting
steel frames was designed according to the Mexico City
Building Design Provisions (MCSDPs) [28].*e buildings are
assumed to be for office occupancy. *ey have 4, 6, 8, and 10
stories, and 3 bays, hereafter indicated as F4, F6, F8, and F10,
respectively. *e dimensions of the frames are shown in
Figure 1. *e beams and columns are A36 steel W sections. A
bilinear hysteretic model for accounting the nonlinear ma-
terial behavior with 3% of postyielding stiffness was con-
sidered for the analyses, and the damping used was 3% of
critical. *e fundamental periods of vibration (T1) are 0.9,
1.07, 1.20, and 1.37 s, respectively. On the other hand, the
FPTCs were designed in accordance with the recommen-
dations proposed by Garlock et al. [21], which basically start

with the design of the steel frames as usually done (consid-
ering rigid connections), and then, the semirigid post-
tensioned connections are designed to satisfy the
requirements of the serviceability and resistance conditions.
*e beam-column connections consist of two angles bolted to
the flanges of the beam and to the column flange (top and
seat). For the design of posttensioned connections, steel grade
50 was used for the angles. *e length of the angles was taken
equal to the width of the flange of the beams (bf ). Different
angle sizes were tested, but at the end, 152×152×13mm
angles were used in all the cases. Posttensioned cables consist
of seven wires with an area of 150mm2, withstanding a load of
279 kN; they are parallel to the axis of the beam passing
through the interior columns and fixed to the outer face of the
columns at the ends of the frame. An initial tension of the
cables less than 0.33 times their maximum capacity was used
according with the suggestions given by Garlock et al. [21].
*e four FPTC models are identified here as F4PTC, F6PTC,
F8PTC, and F10PTC, for the frames with 4, 6, 8, and 10
stories, respectively. *e FPTC models have fundamental
periods of vibration of 0.89, 1.03, 1.25, and 1.37 s, respectively.
*e columns of the ground floor are fixed at the base without
being posttensioned. *e beam and column members used
for all the frames are illustrated in Table 1. Note that the
mechanical characteristics and dimensions of beams and
columns are the same for both theMRSFs and FPTC. Figure 2
shows a typical assembly of a posttensioned steel frame.

2.2. Connection Model: Nonlinear Hysteretic Behavior.
*e hysteretic rules that represent the cyclic behavior of the
semirigid connections of the posttensioned frames are char-
acterized by moment-rotation curves (M-θr), with shapes
similar to a flag. *is representation characterizes the non-
linearity, self-centering capability, and energy dissipation
capacity of the connection. Experimental tests with isolated
angles, subjected to cyclic and monotonic loads, conducted by
Shen andAstaneh-Asl [29] showed a stable cyclic response and
good capability of hysteretic energy dissipation. In general,
ultimate strength exceeded 3 times the yield strength, and
ductility reached values between 8 and 10. *e strength and
stiffness in bending of the posttensioned connections is

provided by the contribution of the angles of the PTC and by
posttensioned strands. Wires and angles work as springs in
parallel. Posttensioned strands exhibit linear behavior, while
connecting angles behave nonlinearly. Figure 3 shows a typical
example of a hysteretic curve corresponding to a post-
tensioned connection. *is behavior was modeled by mean of
equations (1) and (2) which represent the loading and
unloading curves, respectively, obtained from the superposi-
tion of the exponential equation proposed by Richard [30] for
semirigid connections and the linear contribution of the
strands, as well as decompression moments (Md) and the
closing moment (Mc) of the connection. *e first function,
given by equation (1), corresponds to the initial loading cycle;
two types of variables are observed: (1) variables depending
only on geometric and physical properties of angles, such as
initial (k) and postyield (kp) stiffnesses, the reference moment
(Mo), and N that defines the curvature in the transition be-
tween the linear and plastic behavior and (2) variables
depending on the number and type of tendons such as the
rigidity of the posttensioned tendons (kθS) and the bending
moment associated with the opening of the connection
(named decompression moment, Md) which is a function of

the resulting initial tension in the tendons. *e second
function, given by equation (2), defines the unloading and
reloading process in the connection; Ma and θa are the
maximum values reached in each cycle, and the parameter φ
defines the magnitude of the closing moment of the con-
nection (Mc), which must be greater than zero in order to
insure complete closure of the connection after getting
complete unloading; moreover, this parameter largely defines
the EH dissipation capacity of the connection (enclosed area).
*e curves obtained with the modified model exhibit good
accuracy in comparison with experiment results, and they
were modeled in RUAUMOKO [31] as the flag-shaped bi-
linear hysteresis [32].

2.3. EarthquakeGroundMotions. A total of 30 narrow-band
earthquake ground motions recorded at soft soil sites of
Mexico City are used for the time story analyses of theMSRF
and FPTC. *e main characteristic of the selected ground
motions recorded on soft soils is that they demand large
energy on structures in comparison to those recorded on
firm soils [33, 34]. *e ground motions were recorded in
sites where the period of the soil was close to two seconds
and structures were more severely damaged during the 1985
Mexico City Earthquake. *e duration was computed
according with Trifunac and Brady [35]. Table 2 summarizes
the most important characteristics of the records. In the
table, while PGA and PGV denote the peak ground accel-
eration and velocity, tD indicates duration.

2.4. Evaluation of Structural Reliability. *e incremental
dynamic analysis [36] is used to assess the seismic perfor-
mance of the steel frames under narrow-band motions at
different intensity levels. Next, the well-known seismic
performance-based assessment procedure suggested by the
Pacific Earthquake Engineering Center [37] in the United
States was employed in this study, which indicates that the
mean annual frequency of exceedance of an engineering
demand parameter (EDP) of interest exceeding a certain
level EDP can be computed as follows:

demand at the building’s fundamental period of vibration)
and P[EDP> edp | IM � im] is the conditional probability
that an EDP exceeds a certain level of EDP given that the IM
is evaluated at the groundmotion intensity measure level im.
In addition, dλIM(im) refers to the differential of the ground
motion hazard curve for the IM. In this context, while the
first term in the right-hand side of equation (3) can be
obtained from probabilistic estimates of the EDP of interest
with incremental dynamic analyses, the second term in
equation (3) is represented by the seismic hazard curve,
which can be computed from conventional Probabilistic
Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA), evaluated at the ground
motion intensity level im. Note the importance of the

ground motion intensity measure for assessment of seismic
performance, which is the joint between earthquake engi-
neering and seismology. In this study, the spectral accel-
eration at first mode of vibration Sa(T1) was selected as IM,
in such a way that equation (3) can be expressed as

where dλSa(T1)(sa) � λSa(T1)(sa)− λSa(T1)(sa + dsa) is the
hazard curve differential expressed in terms of Sa(T1).
Equation (4) was used to evaluate the structural reliability
of the study-case frames in terms of two EDPs: peak and
residual interstory drift demands. For evaluating the first
term in the integrand for peak and residual drift demands, a
lognormal cumulative probability distribution was used
[5]. *erefore, the term P(EDP > edp | Sa(T1) � sa) is an-
alytically evaluated as follows:

where 􏽢μlnEDP|Sa(T1)�sa and 􏽢σlnEDP|Sa(T1)�sa are the geometric
mean and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the
EDP, respectively, and Φ(·) is the standard normal cumu-
lative distribution function. It is important to say as Bojórquez
et al. [38] indicate that the ground motion records used in the
present study allow the use of spectral acceleration at first
mode of vibration as intensity measure due to its sufficiency
with respect to magnitude and distance and because of the
similarity of the spectral shape of the records since they have
similar values of the spectral parameter Np [39].

evaluate the structural reliability is the computation of the
incremental dynamic analysis; thus, the maximum or residual
interstory drift at different values of the ground motion in-
tensity measure which in the present study is Sa(T1) is cal-
culated. Figure 4 illustrates as an example the incremental
dynamic analysis of the traditional frame F4 under the selected
narrow-band motions. It can be observed the increase of the
maximum interstory drift as the spectral acceleration at first
mode of vibration tends to increase. Likewise, notice that the
uncertainty in the structural response also tend to increase for
larger values of Sa(T1).*en, the fragility curves are computed
through equation (5), which are combined with the seismic
hazard curves to compute the mean annual rate of exceedance,
thus the structural reliability via equation (4) in terms of peak
and residual interstory drift. Note that in this case, the spectral
acceleration hazard curves corresponding to the first-mode
period of vibration of each building and for the Secretaŕıa de
Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) site in Mexico City were
developed following the procedure suggested by Alamilla [40].

*eMexican City seismic design code takes into account
the peak interstory drift. Recently, Bojórquez and Ruiz-
Garćıa [5] demonstrated that, for MRSFs designed with the
Mexican City Building Code, the control of maximum or
peak interstory drift demands does not necessarily guarantee
a good seismic performance in terms of residual drift de-
mands. In fact, by comparing peak and residual drift de-
mand hazard curves, Bojórquez and Ruiz-Garćıa [5]

concluded that, for steel structures that exhibit peak drift
demands of about 3% (the threshold recommended by the
MCSDP to avoid collapse), the maximum residual drifts is
larger than 0.5%, which is the threshold residual drift that
could be tolerable to human occupants, and it could lead to
human discomfort identified from recent field investigations
[4] when subjected to narrow-band earthquake ground
motions of high intensity. For this reason, the residual
interstory drift should be considered in future versions of the

Mexican Building Code to guarantee an adequate structural
dynamic behavior of buildings prone to earthquakes. To
further illustrate the importance of residual drift demands in
comparison with peak interstory drift demands via seismic
analysis. Two damage indicators are computed. *e first
damage parameter is calculated as the ratio of the maximum
interstory drift demand divided by 3%, the threshold value of
maximum drift to avoid collapse according to the MCBC, in
such a way that values equal to or larger than one of this
maximum drift damage index (IDmax) indicates the failure of
the system in terms of peak drift. On the other hand, the
second damage index IDres is similar to the first one but the
residual peak drift demand divided by a value of 0.5% should
be considered (the threshold residual drift limit that could be
perceptible to human occupants and it could lead to human
discomfort [4]). Values larger than one of IDres are related to
the structural failure in terms of residual demands. Figure 5
compares the IDmax and IDres hazard curves for all theMRSFs
at different performance levels. It is observed that in the case

of the frames F4, F6, F8, and F10, when the damage index is
equals to one, the mean annual rate of exceedance (MARE)
is smaller in terms of peak interstory drift demands in
comparison with the residual drift. In other words, the
structural reliability of the selected MRSFs is larger for peak
drifts indicating that the control of maximum demand does
not necessarily guarantee the same level of safety in terms of
residual drift demands. For this reason, if the parameter to
estimate the structural performance of structures is the
maximum interstory drift demand, it is necessary to obtain
larger structural reliability levels aimed to provide adequate
structural performance in terms of residual drift because it is
necessary to obtain at least the same structural reliability in
terms of IDmax and IDres. For this reason, with the aim to

figure, it can be observed that the structural reliability or
the mean annual rate of exceeding a specific value of
maximum interstory drift is in general smaller for the steel
frame with PTC. *us, the seismic performance in terms of
peak demands is increasing when the PTCs are in-
corporated in the traditional MRSFs, which also could
represent an increase in the structural reliability for the
residual interstory drift demands as will be discussed
below.

*e comparison of the structural reliability for the
MRSFs and the PTC frames in terms of residual drift de-
mands provided by the IDres (damage index in terms of
residual displacements) is illustrated in Figure 7. As it was
expected, the mean annual rate of exceedance of IDres value is
reduced when PTCs are incorporated into the traditional
steel frames, which is valid for all the structures under
consideration. In such a way, the use of PTC is a good
alternative, for example, as a solution for rehabilitation of

buildings or in order to reduce peak and residual drift
demands of traditional structural steel systems under severe
earthquakes.

Finally, a comparison of the mean annual rate of
exceedance values when the damage index is equal to one in
terms of IDmax for the MRSFs and in terms of IDres for the
PTC steel frames is provided in Table 3. *e aim of using the
MARE values for IDmax is because they represent the target
structural reliability levels obtained buildings designed
according to the Mexican Building Code. *us, the MARE
values in terms of IDres for the PTC steel frames should be
reduced in comparison to those of peak interstory drift for
the MRSFs to guarantee that by including PTC in the tra-
ditional steel frames, it is possible to satisfy the structural
reliability for the residual demands provided by the re-
quirements of the Mexican Code. In Table 3, a column name
ratio was used which represents the ratio of MARE of IDres
(PTC steel frames) divided by IDmax (MRSFs), and values

smaller or equal to one indicates that the structural reliability
is larger in terms of residual drift demands for the PTC
frames comparing with the peak drifts of the MRSFs. It is
observed that the values of the mean annual rates of
exceedance for the PTC steel frames are in general smaller to
those of the traditional structures when the damage index is
equal to one.

3. Conclusions

*e structural reliability of four moment-resisting steel
frames is estimated in terms of peak and residual interstory
drift seismic demands. For this aim, all the structures are
subjected to 30 narrow-band ground motion records of the
soft soil of Mexico City. *e numerical results indicates that
the structural reliability of the traditional steel frames is not
adequate in terms of residual interstory drift demands. For
this reason, PTCs are incorporated into the selected steel
framed buildings in order to increase the structural reliability
based on a damage index for the residual interstory drifts. As
it was expected, for most of the steel framed buildings, the
ability of self-centering for the steel frames incorporating PTC
reduces significantly the residual demands; in fact, for this
type of structural systems, the structural reliability is larger in
terms of residual interstory drifts formost of the frames under
consideration in comparison with peak demands of the

MRSFs. Moreover, the seismic performance in terms of peak
demands is also increasing when PTCs are incorporated into
the traditional MRSFs. It is concluded that the use of PTC is a
good alternative as a solution for rehabilitation of buildings or
in order to reduce peak and residual interstory drift seismic
demands of traditional structural steel systems under severe
earthquakes. Furthermore, PTC in steel frames could be an
interesting solution toward structural systems with high
seismic resilience.
