Abstract: Medellín is the second largest city of Colombia with more than 2 million 
inhabitants according to the latest census and with more than 240,000 public and private 
buildings. It is located on an intermediate seismic hazard area according to the seismic hazard 
map of Colombia although no destructive earthquakes have recently occurred having as a 
consequence low seismic risk awareness among its inhabitants. Using the results of a fully 
probabilistic risk assessment of the city with a building by building resolution level and 
considering the dynamic soil response, average annual losses by sectors as well as casualties 
and other direct effects have been obtained and aggregated at county level. Using the holistic 
evaluation module of the multi-hazard risk assessment CAPRA platform, EvHo, a 
comprehensive assessment that considered the social fragility and lack or resilience at county 
level was performed making use of a set of indicators with the objective of capturing the 
aggravating conditions of the initial physical impact. The Urban Seismic Risk Index has been 
obtained at county level being useful to communicate risk to decision-makers and 
stakeholders besides making easy to identify potential zones that can be problematic in terms 
of several dimensions of the vulnerability. This case study is an example of how a 
multidisciplinary research on disaster risk reduction has helped to show how risk analysis can 
be of high relevance for decision-making processes in disaster risk management. 
 
Keywords: Urban seismic risk index; urban resilience; holistic risk assessment; probabilistic 
seismic risk analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION 1 
 2 
Several probabilistic seismic risk analysis have been conducted worldwide at different 3 
resolution levels and with different objectives, estimating the physical damage in terms of 4 
mean damage ratios (MDR), average annual losses (AAL) and probable maximum losses 5 
(PML) (Ordaz et al. 2000; Barbat et al. 2010; Lantada et al. 2010; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2013; 6 
2014a; 2015a, Zuloaga et al. 2013; Marulanda et al. 2013; IBRD and The World Bank 2013; 7 
Cardona et al. 2014; Silva et al. 2014; Ahmad et al. 2014). Quantifying risk from a physical 8 
point of view, although important, is only the first step in a comprehensive disaster risk 9 
management scheme (Cardona et al. 2008a; 2008b; Cardona 2009; Marulanda et al. 2014) 10 
after which, it is important to further use those results in disaster risk management related 11 
strategies. It is clear that the physical is not the only dimension and hence those results can be 12 
used as input data for a comprehensive, holistic, risk analysis (Cardona 2001; Carreño 2006; 13 
Carreño et al. 2007, Carreño et al. 2012; 2014). A holistic approach has also been included in 14 
the MOVE framework (Birkmann et al. 2013), one that outlines key factors and different 15 
dimensions to be addressed when assessing vulnerability in the context of natural hazards, as 16 
considered herein. 17 
 18 
This paper presents the complete and final results of the urban seismic risk index, USRi, 19 
estimation for the city of Medellín, Colombia based on a holistic approach for which a 20 
preliminary assessment had been previously conducted (Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b). 21 
Medellín is the second largest city in Colombia with more than 2.2 million inhabitants in the 22 
urban area and where many industries and financial facilities have their headquarters. The city 23 
is located on a valley on the east side of the western cordillera of the North Andean zone and 24 
lies on an intermediate seismic hazard zone where earthquakes associated to different active 25 
seismic faults can generate important damages and disruptions on its infrastructure (AIS 26 
2010; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2010; 2014a; 2014c; 2015b). The urban area of the city is divided 27 
into 16 counties (comunas), each of them with approximately the same area but with 28 
important differences from a social, economic and infrastructure perspective. During recent 29 
years, Medellín has experienced a rapid urban growth and transformation, and different areas 30 
of the city have changed in terms of building classes, population density and availability of 31 
public spaces since low rise houses have been demolished to build high-rise structures to 32 
accommodate a larger amount of inhabitants, a process clearly identifiable in the medium-33 
high and high income zones of the city. 34 
 35 
A holistic risk assessment at urban level, which accounts for the vulnerability in several of its 36 
dimensions, requires a combination of the physical risk results with aspects that reflect social 37 
fragility and lack of resilience. In this context, social fragility is measured by means of 38 
variables that contribute to a soft risk related to the potential consequences over the social 39 
context, trying to capture issues related to human welfare such as social integration, mental 40 
and physical health, both at an individual and community level. On the other hand, lack of 41 
resilience is related to deficiencies in coping with the disasters and in recovering from them; 42 
these latest also contribute to the soft risk or the second order impact factor over exposed 43 
communities. Resilience is an adaptive ability of a socio-ecological system to cope and absorb 44 
negative impacts as a result of the capacity to anticipate, respond and recover from damaging 45 
events; therefore, it is important to know the lack of resilience since it has been proven to be 46 
an important factor of the overall vulnerability; aspects that are captured by means of a set of 47 
indicators. 48 
 49 
For this case study, all the physical risk indicators are obtained starting from damage and loss 50 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

events that can be calculated by using fully probabilistic methodologies, such as the one of the 51 
CAPRA1 platform, by convoluting hazard and vulnerability for the exposed elements 52 
(Cardona et al. 2010; 2012; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014a; Velásquez et al. 2014). For this 53 
study, the probabilistic physical risk results obtained by Salgado-Gálvez et al. (2014a) using 54 
CAPRA are complemented by estimating injured, deaths, homeless and unemployed on a 55 
building by building basis, also based on a fully probabilistic approach and grouping the 56 
results by counties. 57 
 58 
The USRi is defined as a combination of a physical risk index, RF, and an aggravating 59 
coefficient, F, in the following way: USRi = RF (1+F) where RF and F are composite 60 
indicators (Carreño 2006; Carreño et al. 2007). RF is obtained from the probabilistic risk 61 
results, while F is obtained from available data regarding political, institutional and 62 
community organization aspects which usually reflect weak emergency response, lack of 63 
compliance of existing codes, economic and political instability and other factors that 64 
contribute to the risk creation process (Carreño et al. 2007; Renn 2008). This approach has 65 
also been applied at different resolution levels (Daniell et al. 2010; Burton and Silva 2014) 66 
and has been integrated in toolkits, guidebooks and databases for earthquake risk assessment 67 
(Khazai et al. 2014; 2015; Burton et al. 2014). Since not always the same information in terms 68 
of indicators is available for the area under study, each assessment constitute a challenge in 69 
the way that the descriptors are selected and in some cases calculated. 70 
 71 
The multi-hazard risk assessment CAPRA platform holistic risk assessment module, EvHo, 72 
(CIMNE-RAG 2014) has been used in this work, which is a tool that incorporates directly the 73 
output files of the physical risk estimation made using CAPRA-GIS (ERN-AL 2011), the 74 
probabilistic risk calculator module of the CAPRA platform. The module defines factors and 75 
their corresponding weights to calculate RF and F; it also incorporates a procedure based on 76 
transformation functions, allowing the conversion of each factor into commensurable units 77 
and calculates the aggravating coefficient for each analysis area. The USRi is obtained at 78 
county level according to the flowchart of Figure 1. All these computations are made possible 79 
by the modular characteristics of the CAPRA platform. Since risk analysis can be performed 80 
at different resolution levels, the tool allows the selection of the desired level, and if the risk 81 
has been calculated on a more detailed scale, it groups the results into the desired units. 82 
 83 
For the social fragility (FFSi) and lack of resilience (FFRj) indexes, the user can define the 84 
number of factors and assign the weights to be used in each category; as in the case of the 85 
physical risk, the user can also select the transformation function in conjunction with the 86 
correspondent minimum and maximum limits for each factor. Once the above mentioned 87 
parameters are defined by the user, the Urban Seismic Risk Index (USRi) is calculated for the 88 
selected resolution level and results can be exported into tables, charts and maps in shapefile 89 
format. 90

 94 
The whole process is performed within a framework in which uncertainties related to the 95 
physical damage and loss assessment are also considered by using probabilistic 96 
methodologies. Scientific uncertainties become philosophical uncertainties since there will be 97 
an impact on society when a decision is made; thus, it is important to know where they are 98 
and how they have been considered or not (Caers 2011), and since the objective of this kind 99 
of assessments is to derive in actions related to risk reduction, this aspect is worth to be at 100 
hand. 101 
 102 
Obtaining risk results from a holistic perspective highlights the socioeconomic factors that 103 
contribute most to the aggravating coefficient, F, and they should help stakeholders and 104 
policy makers in the integral disaster risk management. Measuring risk with the same 105 
methodology in all counties of an urban area like Medellín allows a direct and appropriate 106 
comparison of the obtained results and it can help in prioritizing the areas for developing 107 
disaster risk reduction and management strategies. Also, the final result can be disaggregated 108 
and the main risk drivers after the holistic risk assessment can be highlighted and in this stage 109 
of the study, after complementing the preliminary results obtained by Salgado-Gálvez et al. 110 
(2014a), for the first time this procedure is performed and shown for the county with the 111 
highest USRi to clearly present which are the descriptors that are contributing the most in each 112 
of the indexes (physical risk, social fragility and lack of resilience) and then, the results are a 113 
useful basis for the development of specific strategies to improve their performance in their 114 
corresponding fields of action. 115 
 116 
Holistic evaluations of seismic risk at urban level have been performed in recent years for 117 
different cities worldwide (Carreño et al. 2007; Marulanda et al. 2013) as well as at country 118 
level (Burton and Silva 2014) and have proven to be a useful way to evaluate, compare and 119 
communicate risk while promoting effective actions toward the intervention of vulnerability 120 
conditions measured at its different dimensions. Although at first it can be seen simply as 121 
another case study based on a well-known methodology, on the one hand, this study 122 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

incorporates a set of probabilistic descriptors in the side of the physical risk that had never 123 
been assessed in Medellín while, on the other hand, since the main purpose is to raise risk 124 
awareness and, not a generally agreed practice on a holistic risk assessment framework exists, 125 
the development of case studies that consider different methodologies (Brink and Davidson 126 
2014) to obtain the input data can serve as examples for future comparisons of the 127 
approaches. 128 
 129 
This is the first time that a study following the above mentioned methodology is conducted 130 
with a high resolution in all the aspects (seismic hazard, exposure and socio-economic 131 
descriptors) and the results are useful to identify risk driver factors that are not associated only 132 
to the physical vulnerability of the dwellings but also to social and poverty factors that should 133 
be examined and tackled in an integral way, stressing out that poverty is not necessarily the 134 
same as vulnerability. The importance of risk analysis has been understood at different 135 
decision-making levels but the need of being incorporated as a development issue by 136 
governments is still on its way. Finally, it also constitutes an example of how an integrated 137 
research on disaster risk reduction can reduce the gap between the risk analysis and its 138 
relevance for risk management decision-making processes (Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014b). 139 
 140 
2. PROBABILISTIC PHYSICAL SEISMIC RISK AND DIRECT IMPACT 141 
ASSESSMENT 142 
 143 
The seismic risk analysis from a holistic perspective requires the calculation of a set of factors 144 
that are related to the direct effects of the hazardous events on the exposed elements and to the 145 
consequences in terms of the possibility of occupying the buildings after the city has been 146 
struck by an earthquake. The first factor corresponds to the AAL by sector, where four 147 
different categories are included (residential, commercial, institutional and industrial). The 148 
other factors are related to the expected number of deaths, injuries, homeless and 149 
unemployed. This section presents the methodology followed for the calculation of these 150 
factors. 151 
 152 
2.1 Physical seismic risk analysis methodology 153 
 154 
For a fully probabilistic seismic risk analysis, different input data for the hazard, exposure and 155 
physical vulnerability are required. Seismic hazard is represented by means of a set of 156 
stochastic events generated using the program CRISIS 2007 (Ordaz et al. 2007), which is the 157 
seismic hazard module of CAPRA; each event associated to the different seismogenetic 158 
sources identified at country level (AIS 1996; 2010; Paris et al. 2000; Taboada et al. 2000; 159 
Pulido 2003; Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2010; 2015b); for each event, hazard intensities in terms 160 
of their first two statistical moments are obtained for different spectral ordinates to take into 161 
account the fact that structures with different dynamic characteristics have different 162 
earthquake solicitations for the same event. Since the city also has a seismic microzonation 163 
(SIMPAD et al. 1999) it has been considered in the analysis by determining spectral transfer 164 
functions for each homogeneous soil zone in order to calculate the hazard intensities at 165 
ground level. The exposure database consists of the portfolio of buildings, both public and 166 
private, and is comprised by 241,876 elements (Alcaldía de Medellín 2010) that have been 167 
identified, characterized and associated to a building class. Physical vulnerability is 168 
represented by means of vulnerability functions that allow both a continuous and probabilistic 169 
representation of the loss associated to different hazard intensities, in this case corresponding 170 
to the spectral acceleration for 5% damping, an intensity measure that correlates well with the 171 
seismic performance of structures (Luco and Cornell 2007). More details about the employed 172 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

methodology and information for the physical risk analysis can be found in Salgado-Gálvez et 173 
al. (2014a). 174 
 175 
Since all input data have been represented using a probabilistic approach, the loss calculation 176 
process can follow the methodology proposed by Ordaz (2000) and that is used in the 177 
CAPRA platform, where a convolution between the hazard and vulnerability of the exposed 178 
elements is performed. The main output of these assessments is the loss exceedance curve 179 
(LEC) which relates loss values in monetary units, with their annual exceedance rates. The 180 
LEC is calculated using the following expression (Ordaz 2000): 181 
 182 

i i

( ) Pr(  ) (  )
N

A
i

l L l Event F Event


         (Eq. 1) 183 
 184 
where v(l) is the rate of exceedance of loss l, N is the total number of earthquake events that 185 
comprise the stochastic set and conform with the seismic hazard in the area under analysis, FA 186 
(Event i) is the annual frequency of occurrence of the ith earthquake event, while Pr(L>l|Event 187 
i) is the probability of exceeding l, given that the ith event occurred. The sum of the equation 188 
includes all potentially damaging events from the stochastic set. The inverse value of v(l) is 189 
the return period of the loss l, denoted as Tr. Once the LEC is obtained, other risk metrics 190 
such as the AAL can be obtained by calculating the area under the LEC. This metric 191 
constitutes the first physical risk factor required to be determined for the study presented 192 
herein. AAL can also be directly computed, leading to exactly the same value using the 193 
following expression: 194 
 195

AAL L Event F Event

               (Eq. 2) 196 
 197 
where E(L|Event i) is the expected loss value given the occurrence of the ith event and 198 
FA(Event i) is the associated annual occurrence frequency of the same event. AAL constitutes 199 
a robust indicator since it can represent risk at different resolution levels and also captures the 200 
participation on the overall risk of the small and frequent events as well as the high and low 201 
frequency events while also being insensitive to uncertainty as is explained later. 202 
 203 
Uncertainties related to hazard and physical vulnerability, defined according to their 204 
characteristics (temporal and spatial for the hazard and intensity-dependent for the 205 
vulnerability), are considered in the loss assessment; thus the result of the calculation process 206 
is a specific loss probability distribution for each hazard event. In the case of risk results in 207 
terms of losses, a Beta distribution is defined through a central value (mean) and its dispersion 208 
or uncertainty measure (variance). The latter is considered an appropriate probability 209 
distribution for modeling losses since results are always defined between 0.0 (no loss) and 1.0 210 
(total loss) and since only direct losses are considered at this stage, the maximum possible 211 
loss is then the total exposed value. 212 
 213 
2.2 Physical risk results for Medellín 214 
 215 
Physical risk is calculated on a building by building resolution level and the obtained results 216 
are grouped by counties according to the location of each dwelling. It is well known that for 217 
the calculation of the AAL an arithmetical aggregation process can be applied to both 218 
counties and sectors. Table 1 shows the values in relative terms to the total exposed value by 219 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

county and by sector in Medellín. Blank values (-) correspond to sectors that are not 220 
representative in the corresponding county. AAL seeks to give an overall and comprehensive 221 
representation of the risk levels, through a robust indicator and not only by loss values for 222 
earthquake events. AAL is calculated considering the participation of all the events, by 223 
multiplying the expected loss by its annual occurrence frequency, for each event. The AAL, 224 
when calculated by means of Equation 2, cannot have associated any uncertainty measure 225 
because it represents the loss results in annualized terms which, on the other hand, represent a 226 
mathematical expectation, not an uncertainty measure. 227 
 228

 231 
2.3 Death, injured, homeless and unemployed estimation for Medellín 232 
 233 
A fully probabilistic risk analysis is normally conducted for the complete set of hazardous 234 
events that comprise the hazard representation. However, for the purpose of estimating death, 235 
injured, homeless and unemployed, this study has been conducted for a single event where 236 
only one event is considered as N in Equation 1. By setting the annual frequency of 237 
occurrence of the selected one to 1.0, Equation 1 will provide the probability of occurrence of 238 
the loss given the occurrence of the selected event, and not the annual frequencies of 239 
occurrence. Though the annual frequency of occurrence of it has been set equal to 1.0, and it 240 
represents a deterministic approach for the temporal probability of occurrence, hazard 241 
intensities are computed for the first two statistical moments representing the hazard 242 
uncertainties that, together with the vulnerability uncertainties, are included in the loss 243 
calculation process as explained above; therefore, the loss calculation is still probabilistic. 244 
 245 
The event was chosen out of the more than 2,500 included in the stochastic set with the 246 
selection criteria of that event generating a direct economic loss of similar order of magnitude 247 
than that of a 500 years mean return period. That value is read from the LEC shown in Figure 248 
2 and that return period is considered of relevance for the design of emergency plans in 249 
Colombia (SDPAE 2002). It is important to bear in mind that the return period of the loss is 250 
different from the return period of the seismic event since, in this case, there is correlation in 251 
the losses and uncertainties in the ground motion and physical vulnerability values (Bazzurro 252 
and Luco 2005; Bommer and Crowley 2006; Park et al. 2007; Crowley et al. 2008; Salgado-253 
Gálvez et al. 2014a). The expected loss for the selected return period obtained from the LEC 254

is estimated in around 12 billion USD2 which represents about 14% of the total exposed 255 
value. Loss exceedance rates are calculated by using the total probability theorem and because 256 
of that, for any loss level, the exceedance rate is calculated as the sum of all the events with 257 
probability of exceeding said loss level. In this case, the uncertainty is being considered in the 258 
calculation of the exceedance probabilities and then, the annual exceedance rates obtained 259 
cannot have associated an uncertainty measure because they are probabilities calculated for a 260 
specific loss value. 261 
 262

 265 
Three different sets of vulnerability functions were used to calculate the required factors. The 266 
first set corresponds to the physical vulnerability functions to calculate the mean damage ratio 267 
(MDR) for each element which captures the distribution of damage values in each building 268 
class given a seismic intensity. If this parameter has a value higher than 20%, the building is 269 
considered to be unsafe to be occupied and thus, depending on its use, its occupants are 270 
considered either homeless or unemployed. The second and third sets of functions have to do 271 
with the deaths and injured estimation and depend on the building class. 272 
 273 
For the estimation of deaths and injuries, fatality rates proposed by Jaiswal et al. (2011) were 274 
selected and also, a workday scenario is assumed. Given that occupation is a dynamic 275 
parameter and the day and time of the earthquake cannot be established with this approach, a 276 
rate of 60% occupancy, which corresponds to an average occupation according to Liel and 277 
Deierlein (2012), was used for the calculation, as previously chosen in Salgado-Gálvez et al. 278 
(2015c). 279 
 280 
The selected seismic event is associated to the Romeral Fault System which is the one that 281 
controls the seismic hazard level for medium and long return periods in Medellín (AIS 2010). 282

Figure 4 MDR (%) estimation for the portfolio of buildings in Medellín 303 

 304 
From the obtained results it can be seen that the highest MDR occurs in Villa Hermosa 305 
County which is located on the eastern part of the city where the high structural vulnerability 306 
is due to the large number of masonry units combined with the amplification factors in the 307 
short period range given the soil characteristics of the city (SIMPAD et al. 1999). Though 308 
Aranjuez County has a significant participation of masonry dwellings, because of local soil 309 
response characteristics, far less damage and losses are observed for this event. More details 310 
about the characteristics of the assets as well as the assigned vulnerability functions are given 311 
by Salgado-Gálvez et al. 2014a. To better understand the building stock distribution along the 312 
city, Table 4 shows the percentage of building classes and the total number of dwellings by 313 
County. 314

 327 
It can be observed from these results that homelessness and unemployment estimations are 328 
higher for Villa Hermosa, La América, Belén, Guayabal and Manrique counties, while higher 329 
death rates due to the occurrence of an event with those characteristics are expected in 330 
Poblado and Laureles-Estadio counties. Even though these two counties have the highest 331 
income levels, they have high human density indexes and high-rise buildings with similar 332 
characteristics that are more vulnerable, from the deaths and injuries point of view, if 333 
compared with low-rise masonry units. 334 
 335 
3. HOLISTIC SEISMIC RISK ASSESSMENT OF MEDELLÍN 336 
 337 
A comprehensive risk management strategy has to be based on a multidisciplinary approach 338 
that takes into account not only the physical damage and the direct impact but also a set of 339 
socioeconomic factors that favour the second order effects and consider the intangible impact 340 
in case an earthquake event strikes the city (Cardona and Hurtado 2000; Benson 2003; 341 
Cannon 2003; Cutter et al. 2003; Davis 2003; Carreño et al. 2007; Barbat et al. 2010; Khazai 342 
et al. 2014). This can be achieved by using a holistic seismic risk assessment where physical 343 
damages are aggravated by a set of socioeconomic conditions allowing comprehensive risk 344 
evaluations that are useful for decision-making processes. This approach also allows 345 
quantifying the resilience of the analysed communities, that is, their capacity to cope with the 346 
negative effects after the occurrence of an earthquake. Detailed information about this 347 
methodology can be found in Carreño (2006), Carreño et al. (2007) and Barbat et al. (2011). 348 
 349 
The methodology used in this study does not require the use of the exact same factors in each 350 
case study, not even in terms of the number of descriptors used, as long as the characteristics 351 
to be captured are well reflected by the ones that are chosen. The explanation is that, 352 
depending on prevalent conditions of the area under analysis, some factors can be more 353 
relevant than others. For this study, physical damage is obtained from the results of the 354 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

probabilistic approach, already shown in section 2, which is considered to have a higher 355 
robustness if compared with previous holistic seismic risk evaluations performed before 356 
because of the available information and its quality (Carreño et al. 2007; Marulanda et al. 357 
2013). 358 
 359 
As it was mentioned before, holistic seismic risk analysis can be performed at different scales 360 
but also can account for multi-hazard approaches (Jaramillo 2014). For this study, the 361 
resolution level has been set to counties and the hazard limited to earthquakes since this is the 362 
only catastrophic peril expected for the city. 363 
 364 
3.1 Methodology for the holistic risk assessment 365 
 366 
Applying the holistic risk evaluation methodology proposed by Cardona (2001) and Carreño 367 
et al. (2007), the urban seismic risk index USRi is calculated starting from a physical risk 368 
index, RF, and an aggravating coefficient, F, which accounts for the socioeconomic fragility 369 
and lack of resilience of the analysis area. USRi is calculated by using the equation 370 
 371 

(1 )FUSRi R F           (Eq. 3) 372 
 373 
known in the literature as Moncho’s Equation. The physical risk index, RF, is calculated 374 
considering a set of factors as well as their associated weights by means of the following 375 
expression: 376 
 377

 379 
where FRFi are the p physical risk factors and wRFi  their corresponding weights. In this case, 8 380 
factors were considered to obtain RF which were calculated from the results of the 381 
probabilistic seismic risk analysis of the buildings in Medellín described in section 2, in 382 
which both their structural characteristics and their mean occupation values were considered. 383 
 384 
The aggravating coefficient, F, is calculated as follows: 385

            (Eq. 5) 387 
 388 
where FFSi and FFRj are the aggravating factors, wFSi and wFRj are the associated weights of 389 
each i and j factor and m and n are the total number of factors for social fragility and lack of 390 
resilience, respectively. For this case, 9 descriptors were used to capture the social fragility 391 
conditions on each county while 6 descriptors are considered to capture the lack of resilience. 392 
Most of the descriptors were obtained using data from the local authorities (Alcaldía de 393 
Medellín 2012a; 2012b; Proantioquia et al. 2012; DAP 2012) with the exception of the 394 
calculation of public areas and distances to the closest hospitals and health centres, where 395 
geographical information system (GIS) tools were used. Figure 9 shows the summary of the 396 
descriptors used in this analysis where the ones denoted as FRFi are related to the physical risk 397 
index, the ones denoted as FFSi are related to the social fragility and the ones denoted as FFR1 398 
are related to the lack of resilience. 399 
 400 



Natural Hazards, 80(3), 2016, 1995‐2021 
 

The selection of the descriptors for RF was based on the outcomes that could be extracted 401 
from the fully probabilistic seismic risk analysis, while existing and available indicators that 402 
capture social fragility and lack of resilience issues were selected for the evaluation of F. 403

Figure 9 Factors used for the holistic seismic risk evaluation in Medellín 405 
 406 
It is evident that each of the factors used in the calculation of the USRi captures different 407 
aspects and is quantified in different units. Because of that, certain scaling procedures are 408 
needed to standardize the values of each descriptor and convert them into commensurable 409 
factors. In this case, transformation functions were used to standardize the physical risk, 410 
social fragility and lack of resilience factors selected for this study. Some of them are shown 411 
in Figure 10. The factors and their units, as well as the [min, max] values are shown on the 412 
abscissa and also, depending on the nature of the descriptor, the shape and characteristics of 413 
the functions vary and, because of that, for example functions related to descriptors of the 414 
physical risk have an increasing shape while those related to resilience have a decreasing one; 415 
that is, the higher the value of the factors, the lower their aggravation. The transformation 416 
functions can be understood as risk and aggravating probability distribution functions or as 417 
the membership functions of the linguistic benchmarking of high risk or high aggravation.  418 
 419

  420 

 421 
Figure 10 Examples of transformation functions 422 

 423 
The values on the abscissa of the transformation functions correspond to the values of the 424 
descriptors while the ordinate corresponds to the final value of each factor, either related to 425 
the physical risk or to the aggravating factor. In all cases, values of the factor lie between 0 426 
and 1. Since the transformation functions are membership functions, for high risk and 427 
aggravating coefficient levels, 0 corresponds to non-membership while 1 means full 428 
membership. Limit values, denoted as XMIN and XMAX are defined by using expert criteria and 429 
information about previous disasters in the region. Relative weights wFSi and wFRj that 430 
associate the importance of each of the factors on the index calculation are obtained by using 431 
an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) that gives ratio scales from both discrete and 432 
continuous paired comparisons (Saaty and Vargas 1991; Carreño 2006; Carreño et al. 2007). 433 
AHP process was based on participation of local stakeholders and national disaster risk 434 
reduction and management experts for the definition of the weights of the aggravating 435 
coefficient factors, while, for the ones associated to the physical risk factors, besides the 436 
above mentioned participants, the authors also participated. 437

Table 7 Results obtained for Medellín 454 

 455 
 456 
Since the results have been obtained using a GIS tool, maps with the distribution of the results 457 
can be built and could be of help to decision-makers for communicative and comparison 458 
purposes among them. For each index, a ranking has been generated to classify each result 459 
into low, medium-low, medium-high, high and very high categories. Figure 11 shows the RF 460 
at county level. The highest RF values are found in Villa Hermosa and Poblado while the 461 
lowest values are found in Popular and Santa Cruz. This is an interesting finding since the 462 
two lowest results correspond to low-income areas and can be explained by the low injury and 463 
death rates associated to the building classes in these areas since they correspond to non-464 
engineered systems, typically made from light materials, that do not represent, in general 465 
terms, harm to the inhabitants. Another finding of interest is that, even though Poblado has 466 
the best socioeconomic conditions, a disorganized urbanization process has been developed in 467 
the area and high rise structures, not always complying with the requirements established by 468 
the Colombian earthquake resistant building code, have been built. Its large RF value is 469 
explained by the high physical vulnerability and the consequences in terms of expected 470 
deaths, injured and homeless in it. In terms of the categories used to aggregate the results, 471 
only Villa Hermosa has a high physical risk index category, while medium-high values are 472 
found at Poblado, Laureles Estadio, La Candelaria, La América and Buenos Aires. 473 
 474 
In all counties, the descriptors that, after considering their relative weights, contribute the 475 
most to RF are the ones that account for deaths and homeless. The estimation of these 476 
descriptors is directly related to the physical damage of the dwellings and, thus, a reduction on 477 
these descriptors can be achieved through the development of retrofitting schemes of at least 478 
essential buildings such as hospitals and schools, while also decreasing the physical 479 
vulnerability of new infrastructure by enforcement on the use of the earthquake building code. 480 
Reducing the existing vulnerability is an ideal approach, but incentives to do so must be 481 
created, even more when seismic risk perception is low because of the low occurrence rate of 482 
earthquakes in Medellín. 483

Figure 11 Physical risk index by county level for Medellín 486 

 487 
Figure 12 shows the aggravating coefficient, F, at county level. The highest F is found at San 488 
Javier which constitutes a problematic area of the city from the social, urban planning and 489 
security perspective. Additionally, marginal areas, such as the ones that exist in Villa 490 
Hermosa and Popular, contribute to the large aggravating coefficients. Better characteristics 491 
can be found in Laureles-Estadio, and Poblado which are the wealthiest and more urban 492 
developed areas, though not necessarily organized, of Medellín. Belén constitutes an 493 
interesting case because, despite the fact that it does not have the best economic conditions, it 494 
presents a low aggravating coefficient because of the presence of several hospitals and 495 
medical centres. 496 
 497 
From the results, the descriptors for social fragility and lack of resilience that most contribute 498 
to the aggravating coefficient, F, are the population density and the public area, respectively. 499 
These issues can be addressed by integrating the results with urban planning actions that can 500 
account for the improvement of today’s conditions regarding those topics and need to be 501 
included in the development plans of the city. The population density captured here is not 502 
proportional to the casualties estimation performed for the estimation of RF since the 503 
vulnerability functions vary from building class to building class and, as shown in Table 4, 504 
that distribution has significant variations along different areas of the city. 505

Figure 12 Aggravating coefficients by county for Medellín 508 

 509 
Figure 13 shows the USRi at county level. The highest USRi is found in Villa Hermosa 510 
followed by Poblado since a high RF value is combined with an intermediate F, whereas 511 
important increases in the final results are observed in La América, Laureles Estadio, Buenos 512 
Aires and La Candelaria, reflecting the importance of accounting for socioeconomic 513 
characteristics, additional to the traditional physical seismic risk results. From here, it can be 514 
concluded that even if income levels are useful to determine the vulnerability of a certain 515 
area, from either the physical or social dimension, it is not the only driver that influences the 516 
final result. Finally, Figure 14 shows the ranking in terms of the USRi to better understand the 517 
differences on the results between the counties. 518

3.3 Disaggregation of the holistic assessment of risk at county level 526 
 527 
Given that the USRi is a composite indicator, after obtaining the final result it is possible to 528 
disaggregate it and to see the contribution of the different descriptors related to the physical 529 
risk and/or the social fragility and lack of resilience. This disaggregation can be made for the 530 
16 counties of Medellín. As an example, the mentioned disaggregation is presented for the 531 
Villa Hermosa County, the one with the highest USRi. 532 
 533 
For RF, as it can be seen in Figure 15, the descriptor with higher participation is the FRF7 534 
(using the same notation as Figure 9) which is related to the number of homeless which, as 535 
was explained above, is directly related to the calculated MDR given the occurrence of the 536 
selected earthquake event. For the social fragility descriptors, the one with higher 537 
participation is FFS1 related to the violent deaths rate, as it can be seen in Figure 16. Finally, 538 
for the lack of resilience descriptors, the one with higher overall participation is FFR1, 539 
associated with the available public space, as shown in Figure 17. 540

Figure 17 FFRi disaggregation for Villa Hermosa County 549 

 550 
Besides allowing identifying the factors that mostly contribute to the USRi either in overall 551 
terms or by category, the disaggregation process highlights the necessity of a multi-552 
disciplinary approach in a comprehensive seismic risk assessment framework since the risk 553 
drivers may be related to different origins such as building code compliance and enforcement, 554 
urban planning and territorial management, as it has been explained for the Villa Hermosa 555 
County. The results of this study can be integrated into other assessments related to the 556 
performance of the disaster risk management strategies in the city, such as the one developed 557 
by López (2010). Also, incorporating these aspects in the disaster risk management scheme at 558 
local level is of high importance in a city where the perception of seismic hazard and risk is 559 
low by its inhabitants, but, where not only because of the geological and tectonic conditions 560 
but to the social, economic and urban planning ones, the occurrence of an earthquake can lead 561 
to disastrous consequences. 562 
 563 
4. CONCLUSIONS 564 
 565 
Probabilistic risk assessment methodologies, such as the one used by the CAPRA Platform, 566 
include advanced tools to quantify expected losses on a portfolio of exposed assets given the 567 
occurrence of hazardous events. These tools must be understood as models that are intended 568 
to represent a reliable order of magnitude of the expected losses and not to predict events and 569 
exact amounts. It is important to obtain physical risk results using a probabilistic approach, 570 
considering the inherent uncertainties, but it is also essential to move towards the use of the 571 
results within a multidisciplinary disaster risk management framework, such as the one of this 572 
study. When calculating physical losses with this approach, it is important to take into account 573 
the correlation between the losses since its exclusion may lead to underestimation of them; 574 
details about how this issue is dealt with, within the CAPRA Platform, can be found in 575 
Salgado-Gálvez et al. (2014a). 576 
 577 
Regarding the risk identification process, building by building information is useful since the 578 
individual location of a dwelling in a large city such as Medellín can lead to significant 579 
changes on its individual expected damages and losses due to geographical variations on the 580 
hazard intensities, a fact that is heightened when a seismic microzonation study is included. 581 
On the other hand, when communicating aggregated risk through maps, results should be 582 
grouped in larger divisions such as counties in order to avoid misleading conclusions. 583

number of elements are required to obtain a reliable estimation of the risk results but seen as a 585 
whole and not on an individual basis. For that reason the physical risk results have been 586 
grouped at county level which constitutes the administrative division for Medellín. Grouping 587 
results on administrative areas can also facilitate the decision-making process since 588 
comprehensive schemes can be developed by establishing actions that, in overall, can reduce 589 
today’s risk conditions. 590 
 591 
It is relevant to quantify seismic risk from both a physical and a holistic perspective because 592 
even though earthquakes are not the most common hazardous event in the city if compared to 593 
flash floods or landslides (which are not considered catastrophic); an event like this can lead 594 
to correlated damages and deaths, as well as to important disruptions occurring at the same 595 
time in different zones within the city. Also, though the uncertainties related to the physical 596 
seismic risk assessment have been accounted for, future research is needed in order to 597 
incorporate the ones existing in the considered socio-economic characteristics (Burton and 598 
Silva 2014). Those cannot be handled by means of probability distributions but nevertheless it 599 
is important to highlight that within the methodology explained and used herein, sensitivity 600 
tests on input data, weight and transformation functions using Monte Carlo simulations have 601 
shown how, at urban level, the risk rankings and risk level ranges derived from the composite 602 
indicator are robust (Marulanda et al 2009). 603 
 604 
Seismic risk assessed from a hard, soft or holistic approach is intended to contribute to the 605 
effectiveness of management strategies which largely depend on the decision-making process. 606 
Though this methodology can be understood as a simplified representation of the seismic risk 607 
at urban level, it performs a multidisciplinary approach that accounts not only for the physical 608 
damage but for social, institutional, economic and organizational issues that influence the risk 609 
results. Vulnerability is not only seen as a risk factor determined by the physical 610 
characteristics of a group of buildings, but also as being related to social fragility and lack of 611 
resilience of the exposed communities, while poverty must be understood as a vulnerability 612 
driver and not vulnerability itself. 613 
 614 
A disaster risk reduction management scheme must involve an interdisciplinary process and 615 
the holistic evaluation contributes to this process, not only by considering the socioeconomic 616 
factor but by being a useful way to communicate risk through the identification of the critical 617 
areas of a city where the vulnerability is assessed considering different perspectives. 618 
 619 
Finally, these kind of evaluations can be periodically updated to evaluate the effectiveness of 620 
the prevention and mitigation strategies defined for the area of analysis whilst highlighting the 621 
most important measures to be taken that are needed to decrease either the physical 622 
vulnerability, the social fragility conditions and/or the lack of resilience. 623
