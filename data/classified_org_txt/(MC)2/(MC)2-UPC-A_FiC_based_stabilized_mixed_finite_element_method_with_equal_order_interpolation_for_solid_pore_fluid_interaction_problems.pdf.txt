Abstract
A new mixed displacement-pressure element for solving solid-pore

fluid interaction problems is presented. In the resulting coupled system
of equations the balance of momentum equation remains unaltered,
while the mass balance equation for the pore fluid is stabilized with
the inclusion of higher order terms multiplied by arbitrary dimensions
in space, following the Finite Calculus (FIC) procedure. The stabilized
FIC-FEM formulation can be applied to any kind of interpolation for
the displacements and the pressure, but in this work we have used
linear elements of equal order interpolation for both set of unknowns.
Examples in 2D and 3D are presented to illustrate the accuracy of the
stabilized formulation for solid-pore fluid interaction problems.

Keywords: coupled solid-pore fluid formulation, saturated soils, incom-
pressible undrained limit, Finite Calculus, Finite Element Method.

1 Introduction
Problems involving the flow of a fluid through a porous medium have al-
ways been the object of special interest in geomechanics. From the classical
contributions of Terzaghi [1] and Biot [2] important effort has been made in
the last decades to develop competent numerical methods in poromechanics
that allow analysing and understanding the complexity of the mechanisms

involved in problems with a coupling between a solid skeleton and a fluid
phase.

In hydrogeology, for instance, these numerical methods are important to
represent the water flow through porous soil when characterizing aquifers
performance (storage capacity, water transmissivity, water content, etc.),
and also to study the dispersion and transport of dissolved contaminants [3].

Another important field of application is in petroleum engineering. Here,
the oil-gas-soil interaction takes the leading role along with the hydraulic
fracturing as a common technique to enhance reservoir permeability and
well efficiency [4, 5].

Other applications for numerical methods in poromechanics have re-
cently emerged for a variety of applications, such as underground storage of
carbon dioxide [6], geothermal energy production simulation [7], and even
analysis of interstitial flow in bone tissue [8].

In 1943, a 1D theory of consolidation was proposed by Terzaghi [1]. This
theory was then extended by Biot to 3D cases [2,9,10]. Although these first
works were restricted to linear elastic materials, they have been the basis
for much subsequent research in geophysics, soil and rock mechanics.

The first numerical solution of Biot’s formulation was obtained by Gha-
boussi and Wilson [11] and the work was further developed by Zienkiewicz et
al. [12,13]. Later on, due to the increasing interest in non-linear applications,
Zienkiewicz and co-workers expanded the theory to a generalized incremen-
tal form for non-linear materials and large deformation problems [14,15].

The mathematical formulation of solid skeleton and pore fluid interaction
presented here is based on the model proposed by Zienkiewicz et al. [12]. The
problem was originally formulated for fully saturated conditions in terms of
the solid matrix displacement ui, the mean fluid velocity relative to the solid
phase wi and the fluid pore pressure p. However, in many geo-mechanical
problems with no high-frequency phenomena involved, the fluid relative ve-
locity wi can be neglected and so the equations can be simplified to work
with only two main variables: the displacements ui and the pressure p [16].

Although in this work we have solved a two-phase medium, i.e. soil and
water, the generalization to three-phase problems, such as those encountered
in unsaturated soils or in oil-gas-soil interaction, are possible extensions of
the numerical approach presented here. In this regard, a simple extension
of the two phase formulation to semi-saturated problems was proposed by
Zienkiewicz et al. [17] and further development was reported by Gawin and
Schrefler [18], and Khoei et al. [19].

In the limit of nearly incompressible pore fluid and small permeability,
the coupled poromechanics formulations suffer from instability problems. Fi-
nite elements exhibit locking in the pressure field and spurious oscillations in
the numerical solution for the pressure appear near this fully incompressible
limit, due to the violation of the so-called Babuska-Brezzi conditions [20,21].

2



The oscillations can be overcome by locally refining the mesh and by using
shape functions of the displacement field one order higher than those of the
pressure field. In practical applications this is, however, not the best ap-
proach because of the increment in the computational cost. In this sense,
stabilization methods have been found to be powerful tools to circumvent the
Babuska-Brezzi conditions violation without compromising the efficiency of
the computation.

Several stabilization techniques have been investigated in the past years
in the context of computational fluid dynamics [22–27] and (incompress-
ible) solid mechanics [28–32], and have been also extended to poromechanics
problems [33–37].

Although each stabilization approach has its differential aspects, they
can be classified in three main categories.

The first category comprises those techniques in which special time step-
ping schemes are applied in order to generate stabilization terms. Probably
the earliest work in this category is due to Chorin [22] who proposed a tech-
nique to deal with incompressible fluid problems which is now referred as
the fractional step method or the operator-splitting method. Such a stag-
gered time stepping algorithm has been found to provide stabilization in the
steady-state when used in a convenient form [22,25,34,35].

The second type of techniques are more direct stabilization methods
based on the perturbation of the fluid mass conservation equation. Thereby,
instead of using special time-stepping algorithms resulting in additional
terms in the steady-state approximation, the fluid balance equation is mod-
ified by adding a stabilization term multiplied by a parameter that needs to
be carefully calibrated [23,24,30,33]. This group also includes the methods
based on the concept of Polynomial-Pressure-Projections, in which the ad-
ditional stabilizing terms use element-local projections of the pressure field
to counteract the inherent instabilities [37–40].

The third category considered here is the Finite Increment Calculus
method, also called Finite Calculus (FIC) [26,27,31,32,41,42], which is the
approach also adopted in the present work. The FIC technique is based on
expressing the equations of balance of mass and momentum in a space/time
domain of finite size and retaining higher order terms in the Taylor series ex-
pansion typically used for expressing the change in the transported variables
within the balance domain. In addition to the standard terms of infinites-
imal theory, the FIC form of the balance equations contains derivatives of
the classical differential equations multiplied by characteristic distances in
space and/or time.

Previously stabilized FIC-FEM formulations were based on the first-
order form of the FIC balance equation in space and can be found in the
literature for quasi and fully incompressible fluids and solids [26, 27, 31, 32],
and even for 1D and 2D poromechancis problems [43]. In this work, the more
recent second-order FIC form of the mass balance equation [41,42] has been

3



adopted as the basis for deriving the stabilized FIC-FEM formulation for
2D and 3D poromechanics problems. This new formulation takes advantage
of the second order derivatives terms to provide a simpler procedure for
obtaining a residual-based stable form of the mass balance equation suitable
for finite element analysis. Proof of the good results of this formulation
regarding convergence and mass conservation are given in [42].

In this work we present a robust finite element for solving solid-pore fluid
interaction problems, in which the continuity equation is stabilized by means
of the FIC method. The element is based on a mixed displacement-pressure
formulation with equal order interpolation for the displacement and pressure
variables. In this work linear elements are used for simplicity.

The paper is organized as follows. First, the finite element formulation
is introduced, starting from the governing equations of the problem and the
fully coupled system of equations to be solved. After that, the instability
problem is stated and the stabilization by means of the second-order FIC
form of the mass balance equation in space is thoroughly detailed. Finally,
two academic examples are solved in order to test the implemented mixed
linear element and compare it to stable elements with a higher order inter-
polation for the displacement field.

2 General finite element formulation
In the theory of porous media, the effective stress is an essential concept for
defining the stress state because it is responsible for the major deformations
and rupture of the solid skeleton. Let σij be the total stress (positive in
tension) acting on the total area of the soil and the pores, and p the pressure
of the fluid in the pores (positive in compression), the effective stress is
defined as:

σ′ij = σij + αpδij (1)

where δij is the Kronecker delta and α is Biot’s coefficient [44]:

α = 1−
K

Ks
≤ 1 (2)

with Ks being the bulk modulus of the solid phase and K the bulk modulus
of the porous medium:

K =
E

3 (1− 2ν)
(3)

In order to account for the coupling between the solid and fluid phases,
the behaviour of a saturated porous medium is governed by the combination
of two equations: the balance of momentum for the mixture solid-fluid, and
the mass balance for the pore fluid.

Balance of momentum for the mixture solid-fluid

∂σij
∂xj

+ ρbi = ρüi (4)

where bi is the body force per unit mass, üi is the acceleration of the solid
skeleton and ρ is the density of the solid-fluid mixture ρ = φρf + (1− φ)ρs,
being φ the porosity of the soil, ρf the density of the fluid and ρs the density
of the solid.

Let us introduce the general definition for the effective stress (1) into the
balance of momentum equation (4). This gives

where ζ is the fluid mass content per unit volume and qi represents the
flow rate. It should be noted that Equation (6) is in a linearized form of
the general mass balance expression as the fluid density variation effect has
been ignored.

The mass balance equation is modified as follows. Let us first consider
the constitutive equation presented in [2] relating the fluid mass content per
unit volume ζ with the volumetric strain of the solid skeleton � and the pore
pressure p.

Equations (5) and (10) have to be supplemented by a constitutive law for
the solid skeleton. In general, for any non-linear material we may consider
an incremental form with a tangential constitutive tensor Dtanijkl as

The boundary conditions for this problem are specified as:

where ũi and t̃i are the prescribed displacements and surface tractions, re-
spectively.

In order to express the resultant system of equations in a more compact
manner, we will rewrite equations (5) and (10) in matrix form using Voigt
notation as follows.

The above system of partial differential equations (17) and (18) can be
discretized by interpolating the displacement and pressure fields as: u =

with N̂i and Ni being, respectively, the shape functions of the displacement
and pressure interpolations, which do not necessarily need to coincide.

Following the standard Galerkin technique [45,46], we left multiply Equa-
tion (17) by test functions NTu and Equation (18) by test functions N

integrate them over the spatial domain Ω to obtain the following set of

The time derivatives of u and p are approximated using the Generalized
Newmark scheme. Thus, for a new time step n+1, we use the GN22 scheme
for displacements [47]:

un+1 = un + ∆tu̇n +
(

∆t2ün + β∆t2ün+1 (30a)

u̇n+1 = u̇n + (1− γ)∆tün + γ∆tün+1 (30b)
and the GN11 scheme for pressure:

pn+1 = pn + (1− θ) ∆tṗn + θ∆tṗn+1 (31)
which are unconditionally stable for β ≥ 14 , γ ≥

3 FIC stabilized element

3.1 Introduction to the FIC-stabilization procedure

For a quasi-static problem the term involving the mass matrix is omitted.
Also, in the undrained-incompressible limit, i.e. when k → 0 and Q → ∞,
the matrices C and H vanish and the system of equations (38) becomes

The resultant system matrix is almost identical to that frequently en-
countered in the solution of incompressible elasticity or incompressible fluid
mechanics problems [24, 32]. In such cases, the spaces used to approx-
imate the displacement (or the velocity) and pressure fields must fulfill
the Babuska-Brezzi conditions [20, 21] or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test
[49, 50] in order to avoid spurious oscillations and locking in the pressure
field.

With the equations presented so far, these conditions can be accom-
plished using shape functions for the displacement field one order higher
than those for the pressure field. Some examples of "stable" 2D elements are
depicted in Figure 1.

ear pressure.

However, low order finite elements with equal order interpolation for the
displacements and the pressure are very attractive due to their simplicity
and efficiency, and so stabilization techniques must be applied if one aims
at solving large scale 3D computations.

The stabilization approach implemented in this work relies on the Finite
Calculus (FIC) method [26, 27, 31, 32, 41, 42] and affects only the continuity
equation with the balance of momentum remaining unchanged.

For the sake of clarity, let us redefine the mass balance equation (10) as:

As stated in the introduction, this technique is based on the second-order
FIC form of the mass balance equation in space for a quasi-incompressible
fluid. This can be written as [42]:

rp +
h2i
12
∂2rp
∂x2i

= 0 in Ω i = 1, ns (42)

where ns are the number of space dimensions (i.e. ns = 3 for 3D problems).
In a 2D case Equation (42) is obtained by expressing the balance of mass

in a rectangular domain of finite size with dimensions h1 × h2, where hi are
arbitrary distances, and retaining up to third-order terms in the Taylor
series expansions used for expressing the change of mass within the balance
domain [41]. The derivation of Equation (42) for a 1D problem is shown
in [42].

The FIC term in Equation (42) plays the role of a space stabilization
term, in which hi are space dimensions related to the characteristic element
dimensions. Note that for hi → 0 the standard form of the mass balance
equation (41), as given by the infinitesimal theory, is recovered.

Remark 1 : Equation (42) can be interpreted as a particular class of residual-
based stabilization methods applied to the strong form of the mass conser-
vation equation. This ensures the consistency of the stabilization method in
the discretized problem.

3.2 Modified FIC-stabilized form of the mass balance equa-

Next we split the stress tensor into its deviatoric and volumetric com-
ponents as

σij = sij + σδij (44)

where sij is the deviatoric stress tensor and σ is the hydrostatic pressure
defined as σ = σii/3.

In the same way, we split the strain tensor into its deviatoric and volu-
metric parts as

εij = eij +
1
3
� δij (45)

with eij being the deviatoric strain tensor and � = εii the volumetric dilation.

10



Now let us write the isotropic linear elastic constitutive equations:

sij = 2Geij (46)

where G is the shear modulus,

σ = σ′ − αp (47)

where σ′ = σ′ii/3 is the mean effective stress and α is the Biot’s coefficient
defined in Equation (2).

Combining Equations (44), (45), (46) and (47), we express the stress
tensor as

σij = 2Gεij −
2G
3
�δij + σ′δij − αpδij (48)

At this point, we substitute the above expression in the balance of mo-
mentum (4). This gives

From this point forward, in the derivation of equations (43), (49) and in
the following, we neglect the space and time changes of α, Q, G and ρ in
the derivatives.

If we now apply the divergence operator to both sides of Equation (49),
differentiate it with respect to time, and rearrange the terms we can obtain

In the previous equation the term ρ ∂ḃi

can be neglected and the term
involving the third derivative of the displacements with respect to time can
be obtained from the mass balance equation. Thus if we differentiate Equa-
tion (10) twice with respect to time assuming that the time derivative of
the body force per unit mass is negligible, and we take into account the
definition of the volumetric strain � = ∂ui

The above equation can be simplified if we take into account that the
last term involves the fourth order spatial derivative of the pore pressure
and the third order spatial derivative of the body force per unit mass. In
practical problems these terms are either zero (for constant body forces) or
much smaller than the others. Hence, these terms will be omitted for the
rest of this work. Furthermore, numerical results have shown that the terms

(56)

The form of the stabilization parameter in Equation (56) resembles that
typically used in other stabilized procedures. We note that this term has
naturally formed from the FIC formulation.

Remark 2 : In the examples solved in the work we have chosen h = le, where
le is a characteristic element length that, for 2D problems, is taken as the

12



diameter of a circle with the area of the element, while for 3D problems, it
is the diameter of a sphere with the volume of the element. In essence

le = 3

where Ae and V e represent the area and the volume of the element, respec-
tively.

Remark 3 : The presence of the characteristic element length le in equation
(56) helps us control the diffusion of the stabilized solution, avoiding over-
diffusive numerical results provided that fine enough discretizations are used.
This fact is clearly shown in the example of section 5.2.

3.3 Variational form of the FIC-stabilized mass balance equa-

Note that the diagonal of the iteration matrix is now different from zero.
MatricesR and L emerging from the stabilized FIC formulation are essential
for ensuring the consistency of the residual-based stabilization method used.

Remark 4 : The consistency of residual does not directly affect the diffusion
of the numerical solution, but it helps improving the condition number of

16



the system matrix and facilitates the convergence of the Newton-Raphson
scheme.

We highlight that the FIC-FEM formulation presented is applicable
to equal order interpolation approximations of the displacements and the
pressure of any degree. In this work we have implemented the FIC-FEM
formulation using three-noded triangles and four-noded quadrilaterals for
2D problems, and four-noded tetrahedra and eight-noded hexahedra for 3D
problems, with equal order interpolation for the displacements and pressure.

5 Examples
This section includes two academic examples designed to assess the per-
formance of the stabilized FIC-FEM formulation in situations near the
undrained-incompressible limit. The first example is an elastic soil column
subjected to a surface load. The second problem is an elastic soil foundation
also subjected to a surface load.

The soil column problem is analysed in a 2D framework under plane
strain conditions, whereas the soil foundation case is tackled as a 3D prob-
lem. The problems have been solved with simple elements with equal order
interpolation for the displacements and the pore pressure, using the direct
(non-stabilized) formulation and the FIC-stabilized formulation presented
in the previous sections. Stable mixed elements with higher order interpo-
lation for the displacements have been used to validate the FIC-stabilized
element.

In both problems, the porous medium is under totally saturated condi-
tions with isotropic permeability. The effect of gravity is not considered.

5.1 Elastic soil column subjected to surface loading

This example consists on a 1 × 30 m column of saturated soil subjected to
a surface loading that lies on a rigid rock bed. The geometry and boundary
conditions of the problem are shown in Figure 3.

The material parameters of the soil column are summarized in Table 1.
It must be noticed that the indices 1 and 2 in the solid bulk modulus Ks, the
fluid bulk modulus Kf and the intrinsic permeability k denote the different
cases that have been considered here. Index 1 corresponds to the nearly
undrained-incompressible limit, and index 2 corresponds to a more relaxed
condition.

This problem is solved in a 2D configuration under plane strain condi-
tions. The geometry is discretized with a structured mesh of 20 quadrilat-

18



eral elements. We have solved the problem using four-noded quadrilateral
elements with bilinear shape functions for both the pressure and the dis-
placements (Q4P4), and nine-noded quadrilateral elements with biquadratic
shape functions for the displacements and bilinear shape functions for the
pressure (Q9P4).

Two different load cases have been considered: a surface step loading
(Figure 4) and a surface cyclic loading (Figure 6).

Step loading case

The main purpose of this first case is to verify that the FIC-stabilized for-
mulation captures properly the pressure distribution along the soil column
under undrained-incompressible conditions.

Figure 4: Surface step loading applied in the elastic soil column problem.

Figure 5 shows the normalized pore pressure along the normalized height
of the soil column for nearly undrained conditions at a time t = 2 s.

Understanding the results of Figure 5 requires taking into account the
fact that gravity is not considered. Indeed, since the only force acting over
the soil column is the surface load, the pressure applied by the surface load
is completely transferred to the pore pressure throughout the column height
and thus the ratio p/q should equal 1.

The results obtained with the non-stabilized formulation and the four-
noded quadrilaterals (hereafter called Q4P4-Direct) are not able to properly
capture the pressure distribution along the column. The element locks and
the pressure oscillates with arbitrary values. In contrast, by using the Q4P4
element stabilized with the FIC approach presented in this work (here called

19



Q4P4-FIC), the correct pressure distribution is obtained. Similar good re-
sults are obtained with the Q9P4 element, as expected.

Comparing the graphs in Figures 5a and 5b one can see the effect of
the compressibility of the materials on the sought solution. Certainly, as we
decrease the value of Biot’s modulus Q, or equivalently, the bulk modulus
of the solid and fluid phases Ks and Kf , the amplitude of the pressure
oscillations obtained with the Q4P4-Direct element decreases near the rock
bed. On the other hand, the results obtained with the Q4P4-FIC and Q9P4

20



elements remain unaltered.

Cyclic loading case

In this second case the objective is to analyse the evolution of the pore pres-
sure in time, and assess the effect of the soil permeability on the dissipation
of the pore pressure.

Figure 6: Surface cyclic loading applied in the elastic soil column problem.

To that purpose, Figure 7 shows the temporal evolution of the pore
pressure at a node located 1.5 m below the surface.

Like in the previous case, the pressure obtained here should reflect the
load applied on the surface. From the results in Figure 7, it is clear that
the three tested elements show sinusoidal pressure evolutions in time. How-
ever, from the nearly undrained case of Figure 7a, it appears that while
the Q4P4-FIC element shows a pressure that correctly oscillates from 500
to 1500 N/m2, the Q4P4-Direct element presents pressure values that vary
from 1000 to 3000 N/m2, making no sense. One must notice that although
the Q9P4 element shows higher pressures than the stabilized element, after
refining the mesh up to 60 elements, the Q9P4 results are in good agree-
ment with the solution obtained with 20 Q4P4-FIC elements (Figure 8).
This evidences the good accuracy of the stabilized FIC-FEM Q4P4 element.

Looking at the graph depicted in Figure 7b one can see that, by increas-
ing the intrinsic permeability k, the problem is no longer as bad conditioned
as before, and so the gap in the amplitude of the three elements diminishes.
Moreover, a greater permeability implies that the water can flow towards
the surface due to the deformation of the column. Thereby, a dissipation in
the pore pressure occurs as the computation advances in time.

Finally, it is also interesting to notice that the pressure becomes negative
after the soil has drained a certain amount of water. This is easily under-
stood if one thinks about the elastic behaviour considered for the porous
medium. Since the applied load is oscillating, the deformation of the elastic
soil experiments a similar behaviour. In consequence, when the soil recovers
its initial position as the load reduces, a suction appears that makes the
pore pressure negative at some points near the surface.

Figure 10: Surface step loading applied in the elastic soil foundation prob-
lem.

As stated before, this problem is solved by means of a 3D analysis.
We use four-noded tetrahedral elements with linear interpolation for the
displacements and the pressure in the non-stabilized form (T4P4-Direct) and

24



the FIC-stabilized formulation (T4P4-FIC). Ten-noded stable tetrahedral
elements with quadratic shape functions for the displacement field and linear
shape functions for the pressure field (T10P4) have also been used in the
analysis for comparison purposes.

This example has two objectives. First, it should help analysing the
effect of the spatial discretization on the solution obtained with the FIC-
stabilized formulation. Second, it may allow us to assess whether the three
element types considered here converge to the expected solution when the
mesh is refined.

In order to do so, two different unstructured spatial discretizations have
been used: a coarse uniform mesh (Figure 11a) and a refined non-uniform
mesh (Figure 11b).

(a) Coarse uniform mesh: 9985 ele-
ments.

(b) Refined non-uniform mesh: 13532
elements.

Figure 11: Spatial discretizations used for the elastic soil foundation prob-
lem.

In Figure 12 we represent the evolution of the maximum pore pressure
with time under nearly undrained-incompressible conditions for both the
coarse and refined meshes using ∆t = 0.02 s. The impermeability of the
case makes that the pore pressure remains constant after the first 0.1 s
of application of the load for the two stable elements, the T10P4 and the
T4P4-FIC. We see, though, a different behaviour in the unstable T4P4-
Direct element, showing a certain dissipation for the finer mesh.

Comparing the T10P4 and the T4P4-FIC elements we notice that, while
the first one surpasses the threshold of 10000 N/m2 for both meshes, the
latter is always below the value of the applied load. In any case, both ele-
ments approach the expected solution as the mesh is refined, which indicates
a consistent response.

If we look at the contour lines of the pore pressure distribution obtained
at time t = 1 s in Figure 13, we can understand the abnormal behaviour of
the T4P4-Direct element. Indeed, the direct mixed formulation with equal
order interpolation elements locks under undrained-incompressible condi-
tions which leads to the incoherent pressure distribution obtained.

Next we evaluate the capabilities of the FIC stabilized formulation to
reproduce a solution where stabilization is not needed. For this purpose
the previous problem has been solved for partially drained and compressible
conditions up to t = 5 s (Figure 14). Results are again shown at t = 1 s for
∆t = 0.02 s (Figure 15). Under these relaxed conditions, the equal order
interpolation mixed element with the direct formulation is able to capture
acceptable pressure distributions as expected (Figures 15a and 15b).

The higher permeability of this second case also permits capturing the
so-called Mandel-Cryer effect, i.e. the increase of pore pressure due to the
application of the load is immediate, but the dissipation due to the outflow
of the pore fluid is delayed by the permeability of the porous medium [51].
Figures 14a and 14b show that, after the first 0.1 s of loading, the fluid
starts draining due to the consolidation of the soil.

In order to properly understand the low peak pore pressure obtained with
the T4P4-FIC element in Figure 14a, it is useful to recall the definition of
the stabilization parameter in equation (56) and observe carefully the mesh
in Figure 11a. It can be noticed that the area of application of the load is
covered by only two triangular faces. This implies that the characteristic
element length around that particular zone is relatively large, and so it is the
stabilization parameter. As a result, one obtains an over-diffusive solution
that leads to an underestimation of the maximum pore pressure.

However, it is interesting to see that the larger peak pore pressure ob-
tained with the T4P4-Direct and the T10P4 elements, caused by an initial
locking of the pressure field, converges to the solution obtained with the
T4P4-FIC element after the soil consolidates.

On the other hand, the results for the maximum pressure obtained with
the refined non-uniform mesh (Figures 14b, 15b, 15d and 15f) converge all
to an almost identical value. This evidences that the FIC stabilization does
not alter negatively the solution obtained with the original non-stabilized
mixed formulation.

6 Conclusions
A stable displacement-pore pressure FIC-FEM formulation for solving cou-
pled solid-pore fluid interaction problems has been successfully implemented
for 2D and 3D analysis. The formulation represents the first application of
the second order FIC mass balance equation in space to the stabilization of
a poromechanics problem.

The FIC-FEM formulation has been used to solve an elastic saturated
soil column subjected to surface loading in a 2D problem under plane strain
conditions. It has proven to avoid arbitrary oscillations along the column,
and it has shown consistent results for both transient and cyclic loading
cases, despite modifying the material compressibility and permeability.

Additionally, the FIC-FEM procedure has been tested in a 3D problem of
an elastic saturated soil foundation. The effect of the spatial discretization
on the sought solution has been addressed in this case. This problem has
showed that the the residual-based character of the FIC-stabilization favours
that the numerical solution converges to the expected solution as the mesh is
refined. Moreover, after relaxing the undrained-incompressible conditions,
it has been shown that the FIC stabilization does not alter negatively the re-
sponse obtained in the original non-stabilized mixed formulation, and yields
an accurate solution.

Comparing this work with other classical stabilization methods, we must
notice that the FIC stabilization allows solving the problem in a fully cou-
pled manner without relying on the time stepping algorithm. It also avoids
the calibration of the stabilization parameter, which simply depends on the
characteristic element size.

Finally, like in the projection stabilization method, the presented FIC-
based approach does not require additional basis functions or element level
condensation, but relies on higher-order derivatives to obtain the terms that
ensure the consistency of the residual-based procedure.
