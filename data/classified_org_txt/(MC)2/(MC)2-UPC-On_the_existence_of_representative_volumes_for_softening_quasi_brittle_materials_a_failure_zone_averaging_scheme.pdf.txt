Abstract

The concept of the representative volume element (RVE) for softening materials is revised in this contribution. It
is demonstrated by means of numerical simulations that there exists a sample which is statistically representative
for quasi-brittle materials with random microstructure like concrete. This finding is an important ingredient for
homogenization-based multiscale modelling of softening materials.

Key words: representative volume element (RVE), quasi-brittle material, softening, multiscale, homogenization

1. Introduction

In the past decade, homogenization-based multiscale modelling (by multiscale we mean multiple length scales,
multiple time scales are out of the scope of this manuscript) has been a topic of extensive research, see [1, 2, 3, 4] among
others and references therein. A concept of crucial importance in this kind of multiscale modelling is the representative
volume element (RVE). There is not a single and exact definition of the RVE for an arbitrary heterogeneous material.
That might explain the existence of various definitions of the RVE, see [5] for a recent review. Briefly speaking a
microscopic sample is considered to be an RVE when (i) an increase in its size does not lead to considerable differences
in the homogenized properties, (ii) the microscopic sample is large enough so that the homogenized properties are
independent of the microstructural randomness. The issue of existence of the RVE for materials that exhibit strain
localization (e.g., concrete, soil), however, has been addressed by a few researchers [6, 7, 5]. It has been shown in
[7, 5] that for softening materials an RVE cannot be found since the material loses statistical homogeneity upon strain
localization. This finding, at first glance, seemed to slow down to a certain extent the development of computational
homogenization techniques for modelling softening materials. It however has advanced the development of the so-
called coupled volume method [8] in which the unit cell is associated to a domain of finite volume (e.g., an element
in a finite element context) rendering the method objective to the size of the unit cells. Along this line, there are the
method presented in [9], the VMM-based (variational multiscale method) methods [10, 11], the adaptive heterogeneous
multiscale method (HMM) [12] and domain decomposition based methods [13]. However, those methods should not
be used for problems when the scales are clearly separated due to the prohibitive computational expense which they
would lead to.

In the past two years homogenization schemes for material layers [14, 15, 16] have been developed in which a
traction-separation law (also known as cohesive law) corresponding to a material layer (e.g., thin fibre-epoxy layer) is
obtained based upon finite element computations at the microscale wherein the complex microstructure of the material
layers have been explicitly modelled. Very recently, in [17] the authors have proved the existence of an RVE for
softening material by deriving a traction-separation law (for a macro crack) instead of a stress-strain relation from the
microscopic stresses and strains as usually done in standard computational homogenization schemes. Related works
on computational homogenization-based multiscale modelling of cracks have also been reported in [18, 19, 20]. In
the micromechanics community, homogenization of materials exhibiting discrete cracking e.g., interface debonding in
polycrystalline solids has been addressed intensively, refer to, for instance, [21, 22].

Motivated by the work in [17] the contribution of this paper is the numerical demonstration of the existence of an
RVE for a class of softening materials with a random microstructure that exhibits damage in an averaged, smeared
fashion. This is in contrast to the material utilized in [17] which shows discrete cracking within a regular microstructure.
It is emphasized that the RVE’s existence proof is an important step in the process of developing a homogenization
scheme for softening materials with a microstructural length scale being very small compared to the macroscopic one.
In this fashion, the separation-of-scales principle still applies. Such a scheme will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

In this contribution we develop an adequate averaging strategy that revises the existence of the RVE for softening
materials. The idea is to average the stresses and strains in the micro samples over a propagating damaged zone rather
than over the entire micro sample which is usually the case in standard averaging techniques. A somewhat similar
approach in the context of micromechanics can be found in the works of [23, 24]. Having a positive answer on the
existence of an RVE for softening materials, a procedure to find its size can be introduced. This could be achieved by a
statistical analysis of numerically loaded specimens as presented in [5]. This is however beyond the scope of the paper
and interested readers are referred to [25, 26, 27] for details.

As a byproduct of the proposed averaging method, objective homogenized stress-strain relationships which look
like traction-separation laws have been obtained. Therefore, the method presented in this work could be utilized
either in numerical homogenization based multiscale methods or in computational homogenization based methods for
macroscale crack modelling. According to the former, a traction-separation law, which is obtained from microscale
finite element (FE) computations via the proposed averaging method in a pre-processing step, is used for describing
the behaviour of cracks in a macroscale discrete crack FE model. In the latter, the traction-separation law for a macro
crack is determined on the fly, in the spirit of the FE2 method [3], from the responses in a propagating damaged zone
at the microscale. Potential application of the proposed averaging scheme can be found in methods with nested scales
computations [19, 20, 17] and with domain decomposition methods [28, 29].

The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the problem statement is given with details
concerning the generation of the samples, the utilized constitutive model and the boundary conditions. The next
section presents the proposed averaging scheme followed by a statistical analysis.

2. Problem statement

2.1. Sample generation

In this contribution, the random heterogeneous material that we investigate is a three-phase material with matrix,
aggregates (of circular shape) and an interfacial transition zone (ITZ) surrounding each aggregate. The material
samples have been generated using SPACE [30], a discrete element program, with input including the sample size,
the size distribution of the aggregates and the density ρ (volume fraction) of aggregates. Details on the generation
procedure can be found in [26]. These samples are then discretized into finite element meshes (three noded triangular
elements). Figure 1 shows an example where three phases can be distinguished in the close-up view.

In order to study the effect of the size of the samples on the response of the material, for three aggregate densities
ρ (30%, 40% and 60%), five samples of a size varying from 10 × 10 mm2 to 30 × 30 mm2 as depicted in Fig. 2 are

studied. Sizes of aggregates are varied from 2.5 mm to 5.0 mm with a uniformly random distribution. The width of
the ITZ is 0.25 mm. The randomness of the aggregate distribution is studied by considering four realizations of each
sample size, see Fig. 3. It should be emphasized that four is a small number for a statistical analysis. However it was
not the intention of the authors to perform a full statistical analysis, instead a statistical study is given to support the
result. The three aggregate densities are shown in Fig. 4.

2.2. Constitutive models

Damage of the samples is modelled by a simple isotropic damage model regularized by the gradient enhanced
method [31]. For sake of completeness, this model is summarized here. The stress-strain relation is given by [32]

σ = (1− ω)D : ǫ (1)
where ω is the scalar damage variable and the second order tensor D contains the elastic moduli. Damage is governed
by the following exponential law

ω = 1− κ
κI

[1− α+ α exp−β(κ−κI)], κ ≥ κI (2)

where α (residual stress), β (softening slope) and κI (damage threshold) denote the inelastic parameters. The variable
κ is a scalar measure of the largest strain ever reached which is defined through the following loading function f

f = ǭeq − κ (3)
with ǭeq being the nonlocal equivalent strain which is, according to the gradient enhanced model [31], given by

ǭeq − c∇2ǭeq = ǫeq (4)
where c denotes a positive valued parameter of the dimension length squared and the local equivalent strain ǫeq is
defined as [33]

ǫeq =
√

〈ǫ1〉2 + 〈ǫ2〉2 (5)

4



wherein ǫi represents the principal strain and the Macauley’s brackets 〈x〉 denote the positive part of x.
In summary, the utilized constitutive model is fully characterized by six material parameters: the Young’s modulus

E, the Poisson’s ratio ν, the three inelastic parameters α, β, κI and the length scale c. These material parameters are
tabulated in table 1 along with the values taken for the various constituents. Note that κI has been set large for the
aggregates to prevent damage and the c parameter has been assumed to be the same for all constituents. The material
constants are chosen so that the material consists of hard elastic aggregates embedded in a soft damageable matrix
with the ITZ as the weakest region. This could be representative for concrete at mesoscale.

Table 1: Material parameters of different phases.

Remark 2.1. The averaging equation 4 was applied with vanishing normal gradient of the nonlocal equivalent strain as
a boundary condition imposed on the external boundary only. Consequently there are non-local interactions between
points belonging to different phases. However this issue is not critical in the present paper since the aggregates are
elastic and the non-local interactions between the matrix and the ITZ relate to almost similar materials. Interested
readers are referred to [34] for related work. We do believe that the conclusions from this paper also apply if the issue
of non-locality across material interfaces has been taken into account.

Remark 2.2. The adopted nonlocal damage model introduces an additional material parameter, the so-called internal
length scale

√
c. This parameter is supposed to represent phenomena occurring at a lower scale. Considering the

heterogeneity nature of the matrix (cement paste) at the microscale (unhydrated cement particles, hydration products
and pores) , it is reasonable to link

√
c to the microstructure of the matrix. However this link is yet unknown, the

value for c as given in table 1 has been chosen without consideration of the microstructure of the matrix.

The failure process of the material obtained with the continuum damage model used in this work is given in Fig.
5. It starts with damage initiation in the ITZ, then the bulk matrix starts to damage. In later stages, damage zones
coalesce to eventually form a localization band.

2.3. Boundary conditions

An important aspect in RVE-based homogenization methods is the boundary conditions (BCs), which are imposed
on the RVE’s boundary, used to capture the effect of the surrounding medium. Commonly used BCs include (i) linear
displacements, (ii) uniform traction and (iii) periodic BCs, refer to [35] for a computational treatment of all three BCs.
The choice of BCs affects the result of homogenization methods including homogenized properties i.e., macroscale
constitutive response, the required size of the RVE and the type (and extent) of localized failure taking place at the
microscale. Since linear displacement BCs inhibit localization to occur at the RVE’s boundary (because it maps a
straight line in an undeformed RVE to a straight line under deformation), it should not be used for softening RVEs.
Uniform BCs are also left out of consideration because of the standard strain-driven FE procedure pursued in this
work.

In this paper we utilize, unless otherwise stated, the standard BCs as shown in Fig. 6 for a uniaxial tension test. Note
that this boundary condition has been used in [26] for a study concerning the RVE’s size determination. Furthermore,
the main content of the current manuscript is not about the proper choice of BCs in RVE-based modelling. Concerning
the damage pattern, the difference between the standard BCs and the periodic BCs is that, with periodic BCs, the
localization band is forced to be periodic as illustrated by Fig. 7.

Non-periodic Periodic boundary condition

In all presented computations a plane strain condition has been used. It should be emphasized that under plane
strain condition, the circular aggregates represent long cylinders rather than spherical particles. Therefore the material
model as adopted in this work was not aiming for as rigorous representative for concrete.

In literature several definitions for the RVE have been proposed for different materials and purposes, refer to [5] for
a recent review. For a specific material, the RVE depends on the physical quantity that is measured. Herein we focus
our attention on the mechanical response of a material expressed in terms of the averaged stress and strain evolution.

From various existing definitions of the RVE we consider, in the present context of random heterogeneous materials,
a microscopic sample to be an RVE when it fulfills all the following requirements

meaning) the whole material. It does represent for the material on the localization zone.

• an increase in its size does not lead to considerable differences in the homogenized properties

• the microscopic sample is large enough so that the homogenized properties are independent of the microstructural
randomness, lm >> d see Fig. 8

• its size is much smaller than the macroscopic dimension, lM >> lm see Fig. 8. This condition is known as the
principle of separation of scales.

As has been shown in [5], for quasi-brittle materials, an RVE does exist for the linear and hardening regimes. In the
softening regime, however, [5] questioned the existence of the RVE. In this work, we take a closer look at the problem
of RVE’s existence in the softening regime and we will demonstrate that an RVE does exist in the post-peak regime
for softening materials. It should be emphasized that in this case the term RVE means RVE for a localization band (or
a crack). Figure 9 gives a graphical illustration for this revised definition of RVE. Note that in this revised definition
of the RVE, the macroscopic length scale lM refers to the size of a macro failure zone.

3.1. Standard averaging

where Ωm denotes the RVE domain (having volume being |Ωm|) with the boundary Γm; σm and ǫm are the micro stress
and strain tensors, respectively; tm represents the micro traction vector while xm is the position vector and the unit
outward normal to Γm is given by nm .

For the considered boundary conditions, refer to Fig. 6, the homogenized stress and strain along the horizontal
direction given in Eq. (6) are simplified to

〈σ〉xx =

〈ǫ〉xx =

(7)

where f intR,x is the sum of all nodal internal forces (x component) along the right edge of the RVE on which an imposed
displacement ū has been applied in the x-direction, see Fig. 6.

A plot of the homogenized normal stress-strain diagrams is given in Fig. 10 for various samples with 30% aggregates.
It is obvious that samples of different sizes behave like different materials e.g., the larger the sample the more brittle
it is on average. It has been based on this kind of behavior plus some additional statistical analysis that [5] has
questioned the existence of the RVE for softening materials. Although the material model is regularized the response
is size dependent. This is caused by the fact that the localization zone does not scale with the size of the RVE, see Fig.

3.2. Failure zone averaging

The dependency of the homogenized stress-strain diagrams on the RVE size as discussed in the previous section
indicates that standard continuum models cannot be adopted at the macroscale in a homogenization-based multiscale
framework for softening materials. This observation has called for, over the past few years, the development of the
so-called coupled volume methods (see for example [8] and references in the introduction section), the second-order
computational homogenization method [37] and coarse graining of failure methods [38, 18, 19, 20, 17]. The salient
feature of coarse graining of failure methods is the introduction of discrete cracks at the macroscale model. We are
particularly interested in [17] in which the existence of an RVE for materials undergoing discrete cracking has been
demonstrated. The existence of an RVE was indicated by the uniqueness (regardless of the utilized micro sample
size) of a macro traction-separation law which has been obtained by averaging the responses along propagating micro
discrete cracks.

Figure 11: Localization zone does not scale with RVE size (30% aggregate).

Prompted by the work given in [17] and the fact that the localization band does not scale with the micro sample size
(as can be seen in Fig. 11), in this section, we will present an averaging technique by which homogenized stress-strain
relationships are obtained which are objective with respect to the micro sample size.

Let us first denote Ωd as the active damaged domain i.e., the region containing Gauss points which are damaged
and loading. According to the continuum damage model we are utilizing herein this domain corresponds to Gauss
points satisfying ω > 0 and f = 0, mathematically Ωd is defined as

Ωd = {x ∈ Ωm | ω(x) > 0, f(x) = 0} (8)

refer to Fig. 12 for a graphical illustration.
We then define the homogenized stresses and strains as the volume averages of the microscopic stresses and strains,

respectively, over Ωd

〈σ〉 = 1
|Ωd|

∫

σmdΩd

〈ǫ〉 = 1

∫

(9)

We refer to this averaging scheme as the failure zone averaging scheme. Since the above domain integrals cannot be
converted to surface integrals along Γm, they are computed directly using numerical quadrature. This averaging will
filter out the linear contribution which makes the standard stress-strain diagrams sample size dependent.

Remark 3.1. Somehow similar approaches in the context of micromechanics can be found in the works of [23, 24]
in which the stresses and strains are averaged over a three dimensional homogeneous elastic media containing either
randomly oriented or parallel micro cracks.

As an example to test the above averaging scheme, we consider three unit cells of a material with a simple mi-
crostructure shown in Fig. 13. The standard stress-strain curve is given in Fig. 14a whereas the failure homogenized
stress-strain diagram is shown in Fig. 14b. Obviously one would conclude that there is no unique size of an RVE while
looking at Fig. 14a. It is, however, clear that an RVE does exist if Fig. 14b has been used as the decision criterion.

domain Ωe and the unloading damaged domain Ωdu.

It should be noticed that Eq. (9) should be used only after development of a failure band i.e., after the peak. That
explains the absence of a linear branch in the curves shown in Fig. 14b. Figure 15 plots the evolution of the damaging
area |Ωd| against the failure averaged normal strain. An attempt was also made in which the domain Ωd was on purpose
incorrectly defined as Ωm \ Ωe (the symbol \ is the difference operator from the set theory) which is, of course, larger
than the correct active damaged domain Ωd as defined in Eq.(8) and Fig. 16 depicts the resulting stress-strain curves
which are again sample size dependent, although to a smaller extent than for a standard averaging according to Eq.(6).

obviously show that, by filtering out the linear responses in the sample i.e., the stresses and strains in Ωm \Ωd via the
failure zone averaging, the responses are independent of the sample size.

In literature a variety of criteria has been adopted in the statistical analysis of the RVE size namely the slope of the
stress-strain curve [7, 5], the dissipated energy [26, 39] and the peak load [26]. In our subsequent statistical analysis
we utilize the dissipated energy Gf which is the area under the stress-strain curve

Gf =

∫ b

a

〈σ〉xxd〈ǫ〉xx (10)

where the integration limits a and b for the stress-strain curves obtained with the standard averaging scheme are 0 and
0.2× 10−3, respectively see Fig. 17a. For those computed using the new failure zone averaging scheme, the integration
limits a and b are, respectively, the peak value and 1.5× 10−3, see Fig. 17b.

The stress-strain diagrams obtained with the proposed failure averaging scheme of four realizations per sample for
the five sample sizes (see Fig. 2) corresponding to ρ = 45% are given in Fig. 18. Those obtained with the standard
averaging are not reproduced here since they were given in [7, 5]. These curves are the input for the subsequent
statistical analysis with the expectation and the standard deviation of a variable x (herein Gf ) given by

The statistical analysis result is given in Fig. 19 in which the left figure reproduced the result reported in [7, 5] for
the sake of comparison. In Fig. 19a we can see that the deviation converges upon increasing sample size, the expectation
however steadily decreases which again demonstrates the RVE size dependence. Figure 19b shows, however, that the
expectation stabilizes while the deviation shows a decreasing tendency upon increasing sample size which supports the
RVE size independence of the failure zone averaging method. In Fig. 20, the results for ρ = 30% and ρ = 60% are
given which shows the same trend.

3.4. A note on periodic boundary conditions

In this section, instead of using the standard BCs given in the left figure of Fig. 6, periodic BCs (right figure of
Fig. 6) are used. It should be emphasized that the aim is not to perform a comparative analysis on those two BCs.
Instead we would like to stress the objectivity of the failure zone averaging technique with respect to the BCs. To this
end, only ρ = 45% is considered and five samples (one realization per sample) are analysized. The results given in Fig.
21 indicate that with the failure zone averaging scheme responses which are independent of the micro sample size are
obtained also for periodic BCs.

3.5. Preliminary result for shear loading

This section discusses the analyses for five samples (one realization per sample) in case of ρ = 45% subjected to
a shear loading as shown in Fig. 22. The result shown in Fig. 23 confirms the independence of the homogenized
responses obtained with the proposed averaging scheme with respect to the micro sample size. Although this is a
promising result, we believe that a statistical analysis as performed for the uniaxial tension test is needed before a
claim on the existence of an RVE for softening materials in shear can be stated.

4. Conclusions

In this paper the issue of existence of the representative volume element for softening quasi-brittle materials with
random microstructure has been studied. By performing the averaging over the active damaged domain, rather than
the entire domain, by which the linear contribution has been filtered out, convergence of the stress-strain diagrams
for different RVE sizes of softening granular materials has been obtained for tensile loading. Extension of this work
will be (i) the verification of the existence of the RVE for shear loading and mixed-mode loading, (ii) the statistically
proper determination of the RVE’s size for softening materials. The existence of an RVE for softening materials repre-
sents a necessary starting point for the hierarchical multiscale scheme for softening materials based on computational
homogenization techniques.
