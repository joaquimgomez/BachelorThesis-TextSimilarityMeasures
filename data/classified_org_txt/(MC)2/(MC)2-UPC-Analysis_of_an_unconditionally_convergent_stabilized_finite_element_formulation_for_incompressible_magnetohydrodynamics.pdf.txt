Abstract In this work, we analyze a recently proposed stabilized finite element for-
mulation for the approximation of the resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations.
The novelty of this formulation with respect to existing ones is the fact that it al-
ways converges to the physical solution, even when it is singular. We have performed
a detailed stability and convergence analysis of the formulation in a simplified set-
ting. From the convergence analysis, we infer that a particular type of meshes with
a macro-element structure is needed, which can be easily obtained after a straight
modification of any original mesh.

1 Introduction

In this work, we analyze a numerical formulation for the approximation of the incom-
pressible visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system, which models in-
compressible viscous and electrically conducting fluids under electromagnetic fields
(see [27]). Many conforming numerical approximations to this problem have been
proposed so far. There are different equivalent formulations of the continuous mag-
netic sub-problem, namely saddle-point and (weighted) exact penalty formulations
(see [42] and [34,2,35,24,25], respectively). The first one leads to a double-saddle-
point formulation for the MHD system. A Galerkin finite element (FE) approxima-
tion of the resulting problem has been proposed and analyzed by Schötzau in [42]. It
is well-known that saddle-point formulations require to choose particular mixed FE
spaces satisfying discrete versions of the so-called inf-sup conditions (see e.g. [18]).
Instead, a weighted exact penalty formulation has been used in [34]. This formulation
allows to simplify implementation issues but introduces a new complication, the defi-
nition of the weight function (see [25]). Alternative formulations have been proposed
for a regularized version of the system, based on an exact penalty formulation [33].
These methods must be used with caution, since they converge to spurious solutions
when the exact magnetic field is not smooth. Non-conforming approximations of
discontinuous Galerkin type have been designed in [38]. They have good numerical
properties, but the increase in CPU cost –degrees of freedom– of these formulations
(with respect to conforming formulations) is severe for realistic large-scale applica-
tions. For the Maxwell equations alone, alternative approximations based on nodal
Lagrangian FEs can be found e.g. in [16,15,28]. We refer to [39,3] for the appli-
cation of residual-free bubbles to MHD and [9] for a two-level stabilization method
with Scott-Vogelius FEs.

Since the resistive MHD system loses coercivity as the Reynolds and magnetic
Reynolds numbers increase, i.e. convection-type terms become dominant, the previ-
ous formulations are unstable unless the mesh size is sufficientely refined, which is
impractical. In order to treat this problem, as well as the previous ones, some sta-
bilized FE formulations have been proposed for resistive MHD in [10,11,30,31,21,
22,43]. These formulations are appealing in terms of implementation issues, since
arbitrary order Lagrangian FE spaces can be used for all the unknowns and include
convection-type stabilization. However, these formulations are based on the regular-
ized functional setting of the problem, and so, restricted to smooth or convex domains
(see [25]). They are accurate for regular magnetic solutions but tend to spurious (un-
physical) solutions otherwise. A further improvement is the formulation in [7,8],
which always converges to the exact (physical) solution, even when it is singular. In
this work, we carry out a numerical analysis of this formulation in order to prove
stability and unconditional convergence in the correct norms while keeping optimal
a priori error estimates for smooth solutions.

The outline of this work is the following. First, the MHD problem of interest is
stated in Section 2. The stabilized FE formulation is introduced in Section 3. We
present a detailed stability and convergence analysis for the stationary and linearized
problem in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. The behavior of the method in advection-
dominated regimes is addressed in Section 6. The possible extension of these results

to nonlinear problem is analyzed in Section 7. Section 8 is devoted to the numerical
experiments. We finish the work by drawing some conclusions in Section 9.

2 Problem statement

2.1 The strong form

The incompressible visco-resistive MHD system of partial differential equations con-
sists of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to the (simplified) Maxwell equations
via the Lorentz force. A linearized version of this system of equations reads as fol-
lows: find a velocity field u(x), a (kinematic) pressure p(x), an induced magnetic
(induction) field b(x) and a magnetic pseudo-pressure r(x) such that

a ·∇u−ν∆u+∇p− (∇×b)×d = fu, (2.1a)
∇ ·u = gu, (2.1b)

λ∇× (∇×b)+∇r−∇× (u×d) = fb, (2.1c)
∇ ·b = gb, (2.1d)

in x ∈ Ω , where Ω ⊂ Rd is the spatial open bounded domain filled by the fluid (as-
sumed polyhedral in the finite element approximation), d being the space dimen-
sion. With regard to the physical parameters that describe the fluid, ρ is its density,
µf the fluid viscosity, µm the magnetic permeability and σ the electric conductiv-
ity. Further, ν := µfρ−1 and λ := (ρµ2mσ)

−1. In this work, we consider all physical
properties constant; we refer to [5] for discontinuous physical coefficients for the
electromagnetic problem. (a,d) is the point around which the system has been lin-
earized. In order to recover the nonlinear case, (a,d) must be replaced by (u,κb),
where κ := (ρµm)−1. Regularity conditions for (a,d) are discussed later. fu and fb
are the forcing terms, fb being solenoidal.

We can also consider the non-dimensionalized equations, by introducing the char-
acteristic quantities (U0,B0,L0) for the velocity, magnetic field and length of the do-
main. In this case, the equations are characterized by three adimensional parameters,
the hydrodynamic Reynolds number Re, the coupling number N and the magnetic
Reynolds number Rm. If (2.1a)-(2.1d) are written in dimensionless form, we should
identify Re = ν−1, N = κ and Rm = κλ−1. The coupling number is usually written
in terms of the Hartmann number Ha as N = Ha2(Re Rm)−1.

Let us remark the fact that we have introduced gb and gu. We are only interested
in the case when both functions are zero, but this generalization will allow us to re-
use the following stability results in the convergence analysis. These equations must
be supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions.

In order to introduce the boundary conditions, let us consider two disjoint parti-
tions of the domain boundary Γ ≡ ∂Ω :

Γ = Γf,e∪Γf,n, Γ = Γm,e∪Γm,n,

where the first subscript denotes the subproblem (f for fluid and m for magnetic) and
the second one the type of boundary condition (e for essential and n for natural).



4 Santiago Badia et al.

Then, the fluid sub-problem is supplemented with the standard boundary conditions:

u = uΓ on Γf,e, −pn+νn ·∇u = σn,Γ on Γf,n,

where uΓ (x) and σn,Γ (x) are the trace and normal stress prescribed; n(x) denotes
the normal vector on Γ pointing outwards from Ω . With regard to the magnetic sub-
problem, we consider the set of ideal boundary conditions:

n×b = n×bΓ , r = 0 on Γm,e, n ·b = n ·bΓ , n× (∇×b) = JΓ on Γm,n,

where n ·bΓ and n×bΓ are the normal and tangential traces to be prescribed; clearly,
JΓ ·n must vanish.

Taking the divergence of (2.1c), we easily infer that r = 0. Unfortunately, this
is not true in general for the discretized system. For numerical purposes, it is more
suitable to explicitly enforce (2.1d) via a Lagrange multiplier, the magnetic pseudo-
pressure r(x).

2.2 The weak form

Let us introduce some notation to set up the weak form of the problem. As usual,
Sobolev spaces of functions whose derivatives of order up to m belong to L2(Ω) are
denoted by Hm(Ω); H10 (Ω) is the subspace of H

1(Ω) of functions vanishing on ∂Ω .
The space of vector functions with components in L2(Ω) and with divergence also in
L2(Ω) is denoted H(div;Ω); if the components are L2(Ω) and the curl is in L2(Ω)d

the space is denoted H(curl;Ω). H(div0;Ω) is the subspace of L2(Ω)d of divergence
free vector functions.

The inner product of f ,g ∈ L2(Ω) is represented as ( f ,g), whereas 〈 f ,g〉 is used
to denote the integral

∫
Ω

f g whenever it makes sense; this in particular applies for the
duality between H10 (Ω) and its topological dual H

−1(Ω). The same notation is used
for both scalar and vector valued functions. Given a normed functional space X , its
norm is written as ‖ · ‖X , with the abbreviations ‖ · ‖L2(Ω) ≡ ‖ · ‖, ‖ · ‖Hm(Ω) ≡ ‖ · ‖m,
‖ · ‖H−1(Ω) ≡ ‖ ·‖−1, ‖ · ‖H(curl;Ω) ≡ ‖ ·‖curl. Finally, the symbol . is used to denote
≤ up to positive constants that do not depend on numerical or physical parameters.

Let us consider the functional setting in which the system of equations (2.1) is
well-posed. For the sake of clarity, we will consider homogeneous essential bound-
ary conditions; in any case, the extension to the most general case is standard. We
introduce the vectorial functional spaces:

V = {v ∈ H1(Ω)d such that v = 0 on Γ },
C = {c ∈ H(curl;Ω) such that n× c = 0 on Γ },

for the velocity and magnetic field functions, respectively. Further, the space for fluid
pressures is Q≡ L20(Ω) and the one for magnetic pseudo-pressures S≡H

1
0 (Ω). Now,

we can state the stationary MHD problem at hand in its weak form as follows: find



Analysis of a finite element formulation for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics 5

u ∈V , b ∈C, p ∈ Q and r ∈ S such that

〈a ·∇u,v〉+(ν∇u,∇v)− (p,∇ ·v)−〈(∇×b)×d,v〉= 〈fu,v〉, (2.2a)
(q,∇ ·u) = 〈gu,q〉, (2.2b)

(λ∇×b,∇× c)−〈∇× (u×d),c〉+(∇r,c) = 〈fb,c〉, (2.2c)
−(∇s,b) = 〈gb,s〉, (2.2d)

for any (v,c,q,s) ∈ V ×C×Q× S. Let us show that r ≡ 0 in (2.2). Taking c = ∇r
(which clearly belongs to C) in (2.2c), and using the fact that ∇×∇r = 0 and ∇ ·fb = 0
a.e. in Ω , we obtain ‖∇r‖ = 0. Since r vanishes on ∂Ω , it implies r ≡ 0 a.e. in Ω
by virtue of Poincaré’s inequality. We refer to [35, Propositions 3.4 and 3.5] for the
completion of the proof.

Let us re-write system (2.2) in compact manner as:

A ((u,b, p,r),(v,c,q,s)) = F (v,c,q,s), ∀(v,c,q,s) ∈V ×C×Q×S.

with the obvious definition of the bilinear form A and the linear form F .
In the following, we consider infima and suprema with respect to functions in

some space different from the zero function. For the sake of brevity, we will omit the
fact that the zero function cannot be picked. Problem (2.2) is well-posed due to the
inf-sup conditions

inequalities

‖v‖1 ≤CP,1‖∇v‖ forv ∈ H10 (Ω)
d ,

‖c‖H(curl;Ω) ≤CP,2‖∇× c‖ forc ∈C∩H(div0;Ω), (2.4)

e.g., see [40, Corollary 3.51].
From the standard theory of saddle-point problems, well-posedness of the MHD

system (2.2) is proved in the next theorem.

Theorem 2.1 The following inf-sup condition is satisfied,

inf
(u,b,p,r)∈V×C×Q×S

sup
(v,c,q,s)∈V×C×Q×S

A ((u,b, p,r),(v,c,q,s))
‖(u,b, p,r)‖Gal×‖(v,c,q,s)‖Gal

≥ β > 0. (2.5)

As a consequence, formulation (2.2) is well-posed.

Proof: We can easily check that A ((u,b,0,0),(v,c,0,0)) is a bilinear, continuous
and coercive form when it is restricted to V ∩H(div0;Ω)×C∩H(div0;Ω). It is a
direct consequence of the Poincaré-Friedrichs inequalities (2.4). This result, together
with the inf-sup conditions (2.3) are necessary and sufficient conditions for proving
(2.5) (see [29, Proposition 2.36]). We know from the theory of saddle-point problems
that (2.2) is well-posed if and only if condition (2.5) is satisfied (see [29, Theorem
2.34]). �

3 A stabilized FE formulation suitable for singular magnetic solutions

Let us present now the spatial discretization we propose. Let {Th}, with 0< h≤ 1, be
a family of partitions of the domain Ω , such that hdiam(Ω) ≤ max{diam(K) : K ∈
Th}. For simplicity we assume Ω polyhedral and {Th} quasi-uniform. Summation
over all the element domains K is denoted as ∑K . Finite element spaces and FE func-
tions are identified with the subscript h. Only conforming approximations are consid-
ered, i.e., the FE spaces where the unknowns are sought are V h ⊂V , Ch ⊂C, Qh ⊂Q
and Sh ⊂ S. In particular, we will use C 0 Lagrangian finite element interpolations
of an arbitrary order for all the unknowns. Given two functions f and g piecewise
polynomial on each K ∈Th, we define ( f ,g)h := ∑K

∫
K f g and ‖ f‖h := ( f , f )

1/2
h .

Since we assume {Th} quasi-uniform, the following inverse inequality holds:

‖∇vh‖L2(K) ≤
Cinv

h
‖vh‖L2(K), K ∈Th, (3.1)

for a positive constant Cinv and for all piecewise polynomial functions vh.
We consider a residual-based stabilized FE formulation for the MHD problem.

This type of formulation does not change the statement of the continuous problem but
modifies the way the discretization is performed. Instead of considering only those
terms that come from a Galerkin discretization, this type of formulation includes
additional terms, that are always proportional to some residual, and so, consistent.
In order for this approach to be effective, the new terms must provide stability over
the Lagrange multiplier-type unknowns which allows one to circumvent discrete inf-
sup conditions, as well as convection stability (see e.g. [20]). In order to obtain a
numerical algorithm suitable for singular solutions and avoiding the need to define
weighting functions that require information about the placement of singularities, we
stick to the double saddle-point formulation (2.2). The resulting method has been
stated in Algorithm 1; we refer to [7] for a motivation of the method.

We consider the following norms that will be used hereafter:

Norm (3.3a) is the continuous norm in which the problem is well-posed, and the
Galerkin norm when using stable mixed FEs. The extra stability due to the form S
is given by the semi-norm (3.3b). Norm (3.3c) is the one that adds the stability that
comes from the coercive terms in A to the one that comes from S . Finally, norm

4 Stability analysis

In this section, we analyze the stability properties of the stabilized FE formulation
in Algorithm 1. First, we prove coercivity of the stabilized form Astab in the weak
stabilized norm. Next, we prove a weak inf-sup which includes ‖b‖ and ‖p‖ control.
We attain this result relying on the continuous inf-sup condition (2.5) proved in The-
orem 2.1. We absorb the length scale coefficients in the constants, since it clarifies
the exposition.

Lemma 4.1 Forms Astab and A satisfy the following properties:

control over uh in H1(Ω)3 is consequence of Poincaré’s inequality. It proves the weak
coercivity.

In order to prove the weak inf-sup condition, let us invoke the continuous inf-sup
condition (2.5) for the full MHD system, which can be stated as follows: for any
(uh,bh, ph,rh) ∈V h×Ch×Qh×Sh there exists (v,c,q,s) ∈V ×C×Q×S with unit
Galerkin norm such that

‖(uh,bh, ph,rh)‖Gal ≤A ((uh,bh, ph,rh),(v,c,q,s)).

Now, we have that

A ((uh,bh, ph,rh),(v,c,q,s)) =A ((uh,bh, ph,rh),(εh(v),c,q,εh(s)))
+A ((uh,bh, ph,rh),(πh(v),0,0,πh(s))), (4.1)

where εh(v) := v− πh(v) and πh(v) is a continuous FE interpolant in H1(Ω) of a
function v (scalar or vector valued) with optimal interpolation properties that pre-
serves null traces, e.g. the Scott-Zhang interpolant [17].

Lq(Ω) that holds for q ∈ [1,∞) in dimension two and for q ∈ [1,6) in dimension
three. Noting that q(δ ,d)′ belongs to these intervals in both dimensions, we prove
the result. Now, we bound the first term in the RHS of (4.1) as follows:

πh(·). Noting that for any ε ∈ (0,3) there exists δ > 0 such that d + ε > q(δ ,d), we
prove the result. Let us stress the fact that ε can be taken arbitrarily small. �

Combining the previous lemmas, we readily get a weak inf-sup condition which
provides control in the strong stabilized form.

Now, we are in position to provide bounds of the FE solution of the MHD problem
in Algorithm 1 with respect to the data.

Theorem 4.1 The solution (uh,bh, ph,rh) of the FE problem (3.2) satisfies:

(i) Weak stability: For a ∈ H1(Ω)d and d ∈ H(curl;Ω), it holds

‖(uh,bh, ph,rh)‖stab,w ≤ sup
(vh,ch,qh,sh)∈V h×Ch×Qh×Sh

Fstab(vh,ch,qh,sh)
‖vh,ch,qh,sh‖stab,w

(4.3)

(ii) Strong stability: For a ∈ L∞(Ω)d and d ∈W 1,d+ε(Ω)d ∩L∞(Ω)d for an arbitrar-
ily small ε > 0, it holds

Proof: We readily prove the weak stability invoking Lemma 4.1 and the stabilized
FE system (3.2). Strong stability is proved using Corollary 4.1. The second term in
the right-hand side of (4.2) is readily handled by the weak stability (4.3). On the other
hand, the first term is bounded as follows:

A ((uh,bh, ph,rh),(πh(v),0,0,πh(s))) =
− (τ1(Xu(uh, ph,bh)−ν∆uh),a ·∇πh(v)+ν∆πh(v))h
− (τ2∇ ·uh,∇ ·πh(v))− (τ3(∇× (uh×d)−λ∇× (∇×bh)),∇× (πh(v)×d))h

that holds for any smooth vector fields a and b, and similar arguments as those above.
Invoking these bounds in (4.5), we easily get:

Using again that for small enough ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that d+ε > q(δ ,d),
we prove the theorem. �

Remark 4.1 In practice, both a and d will be FE functions.1 In this situation, we can
clearly reduce the assumptions over these two functions in Theorem 4.1.

The following corollary consists of the restriction of the previous analysis to FE
functions.

Corollary 4.2 Let us assume that ah ∈V h and dh ∈Ch∩Ld+ε(Ω)d for some ε > 0.
The FE solution of (3.2) satisfies inequality (4.4) for

that holds for FE functions vh, where d is the space dimension (see [17, Th. 4.5.11]).
In dimension three, we have that:

Therefore, using the fact that 1 + min(a,a2) . 1 + a for any a > 0, the previous
corollary applies for the definition of ξ in (4.6). �

Remark 4.2 In the previous results, we observe that stability bounds for some terms
of the Galerkin norm, as well as the extra stability that comes from the stabilization
terms do not deteriorate in asymptotic regimes. However, control over ‖p‖ and ‖b‖
can deteriorate for fixed grids in some singular limits of the continuous problem that
imply a coercivity loss. Anyway, the same behavior has been observed for the Navier-
Stokes problem alone when solved by using stabilized FE techniques.

5 Convergence analysis

Once we have proved stability of the problem, we look at the convergence properties
of the numerical algorithm. We are interested in both convergence towards the exact
solution (even when it is rough) and optimal order of convergence, i.e. a priori error
estimates when the solution is smoother.

Using the fact that the stabilized FE problem (3.2) is consistent, i.e. the exact
solution satisfies the FE equality, we have that:

Astab((χ(uh,u),χ(bh,b),χ(ph, p),χ(rh,r)),(vh,ch,qh,sh))
= Astab((εh(u),εh(b),εh(p),εh(r)),(vh,ch,qh,sh)), (5.1)

where χ(v,w) := v−πh(w); as stated above, εh(v) := v−πh(v) and πh(v) is a con-
tinuous FE interpolant in H1(Ω) with optimal interpolation properties that preserves
null traces, e.g. the Scott-Zhang interpolant. Let us also define the following norms:

So, the norms with the tilde have all the terms of those without the tilde except the
stabilization term related to τ5. Let us also define the error functions:

,

for some ε > 0. In order for the error function ES (h) to be well-defined, we require
−ν∆u+Xu(u,b, p) ∈ L2(Ω)d and λ∇× (∇×b)−∇× (u×d) ∈ L2(Ω)d , which are
true for fu ∈ L2(Ω)d and fb ∈ L2(Ω)d , respectively; this is easily inferred from the
continuous problem. Furthermore, the boundary terms are well defined since bh ∈
L2(∂K) for every K ∈Th (see [6, Corollary 3.8]).

Theorem 5.1 Under the conditions of Corollary 4.1, the following a priori error es-
timate holds

‖(u−uh,b−bh, p− ph,r− rh)‖s̃tab,w . EA (h)+ES (h),

for the error functions defined above.

Proof: Let us bound the right hand side of the error system (5.1), first Galerkin
terms and second stabilization ones. Proceeding as in the proof of Lemma 4.1, we
obtain

〈εh(b),∇× (v×d)〉. L

0 ‖∇× εh(bh)‖‖v‖1‖d‖Ld+ε (Ω).

This result, together with a straight use of integration-by-parts, Schwarz’s inequality,
the fact that εh(r) = 0 and the definition of τ4, lead to:

A ((εh(u),εh(b),εh(p),εh(r)),(vh,ch,qh,sh))
=−〈εh(u),Xu(vh,qh,ch)〉+ν(∇εh(u),∇vh)− (εh(p),∇ ·vh)

In order to bound the stabilization terms, we proceed as follows:

easily obtain:

S (εh(u),εh(b),εh(p),εh(r)),(v,c,q,s))≤ ES (h)‖(v,c,q,s)‖stab,w. (5.3)

So, using the weak coercivity in Lemma 4.1 and the previous results, we straightfor-
wardly get:

‖(χ(uh,u),χ(bh,b),χ(ph, p),χ(rh,r))‖stab,w . EA (h)+ES (h). (5.4)

Finally, using the triangle inequality and the fact that

‖(εh(u),εh(c),εh(p),εh(s))‖s̃tab,w . EA (h)+ES (h)

we prove the theorem. �
On the other hand, we can recover convergence on the strong stabilized norm as

follows:

Theorem 5.2 Under the conditions of Corollary 4.2, the following a priori error es-
timate holds

‖(u−uh,b−bh, p− ph,r− rh)‖s̃tab,s . ξ (EA (h)+ES (h)),

for the error functions defined above.

Proof: First, invoking Theorem 4.1, we have

‖(χ(uh,u),χ(bh,b),χ(ph, p),χ(rh,r))‖stab,s
. ξ‖(χ(uh,u),χ(bh,b),χ(ph, p),χ(rh,r))‖stab,w

Astab((εh(u),εh(b),εh(p),εh(r)),(vh,0,0,sh))
‖(vh,0,0,sh)‖stab,s

.

We can readily bound the right hand side using the bounds in (5.2)-(5.3) and (5.4), in
order to get:

‖(χ(uh,u),χ(bh,b),χ(ph, p),χ(rh,r))‖stab,s . ξ (EA (h)+ES (h)).

Using the relation τ

− 12 we easily get

‖(εh(u),εh(c),εh(p),εh(s))‖s̃tab,s . EA (h)+ES (h).

Combining the last two inequalities and the triangle inequality, we prove the theorem.

So, the convergence results are optimal, in the sense that optimal rates are obtained
for smooth enough functions. In order to get convergence to singular components of
the magnetic field, the following approximability condition must hold:

This condition is true for Lagrangian FEs for meshes with a particular macro-element
structure (see [6, Assumption 1 and Corollary 5]). One type of element that satisfies
this condition is the Powell-Sabin macro-element (see [41,44] and [19, Remark 4.1]);
we note that in two space dimensions this macroelement requires its circumcenter
to remain inside the FE. Further, numerical experiments in 2D and 3D show that
both the Powell-Sabin and criss-cross elements provide excellent results (see [7]).
In the numerical experiments section, we have extended these results, evaluating the
effect of not using this type of meshes in the convergence towards singular solutions.
Finally, let us stress the fact that this macro-element structure is only needed for
singular solutions, that appear in non-convex domains. For smooth solutions, with
b ∈ H1(Ω)d , the convergence analysis and approximability properties are easy to
check and hold for any type of mesh. We refer to [6] for a detailed discussion on this
topic, in the framework of the Maxwell operator.

Remark 5.1 It is not the target of the method developed in this work the eigenvalue
MHD problem [14]. Since the requirements for a method to be useful for initial and
boundary value problems, viz. stability and convergence estimates, are different to
the ones for eigenvalue problems (see [12]), it is unclear whether this approach would
serve in this last case. However, due to the large amount of problems of interest that
are governed by the initial and boundary value MHD problem, efficient methods for
this problem, as the one analyzed herein, are useful for the MHD community. We
refer to [13] for the application of a similar algorithm to the eigenvalue Maxwell
problem.

Remark 5.2 The previous version of the stabilized MHD problem in [21,22] (not
converging to singular solutions) has extensively been used for large-scale problems
by Shadid and co-workers (see e.g. [43,26]). They have observed that stabilized MHD
systems are much easier to solve than inf-sup stable formulations, especially for the
parallel algebraic multigrid method in TRILINOS (see [36,37]), and favor their use
for large scale MHD problems.

Remark 5.3 This type of stabilized FE formulations have also been used succesfully
for transient problems in [8]. It is due to the fact that the divergence-free constraint is
explicitly enforced at every time step via the introduction of the pseudo-pressure r.

Remark 5.4 Let us note that a method that introduces similar stabilization terms has
been proposed in [13] for electromagnetic eigenvalue problems. The method in [13]
depends on a coefficient α and corresponds to the method proposed in [6] for α = 1
with the only difference that no restriction over the FE spaces or meshes is assumed.
Unfortunately, the convergence analysis in [13] does not apply for α = 1, since the



16 Santiago Badia et al.

analysis says that polynomials of infinite order would be required in this case. See
[5] and the numerical experiments section for further details.

6 Advection-dominated limits

Applications of the incompressible resisitve MHD simulations in the earth include
aluminium electrolysis, electromagnetic pumping, MHD generators, electromagnetic
casting and more recently, breeding blankets in fusion reactors. In these applications,
the hydrodynamic Reynolds number Re can be high (close to 105), which justifies
the need to use stabilization techniques. The Hartmann number is usually low (of the
order of 1) in most industrial applications. However, some breeding blanket designs
in fusion technology involve very large external magnetic fields, leading to Hart-
mann numbers that can reach 105. Finally, the magnetic Reynolds number is low to
moderate in all cases, usually in the range 10−2− 1. The dynamo effect in geody-
namics deals with moderate magnetic Reynolds number (about 200). Thus, robust
FE solvers for industrial (and geophysical) applications should be meaningful in the
limit of ν → 0, whereas the value λ = Ha2Re−1Rm−2 is moderate.

Let us note that in these regimes to stabilize the fluid sub-problem is not enough to
get error estimates that do not blow up with large hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers.
We are forced to stabilize the magnetic sub-problem, in order to treat the term (−∇×
(εh(u)×d),ch). We refer to [31, Remark 3.5.2] for a detailed explanation of this fact.

Let us discuss the assymptotic behavior of the stabilization parameters related to
advection-type stabilization, i.e. τ1 and τ3. We consider the non-dimensional equa-
tions. Using the simple fact that, given positive values a, b ∈ R+,

we can prove, after some algebraic manipulations that

where h stands for equality up to constants. With respect to τ1, the third and fourth
values are of no practical interest, whereas h is the correct value for unresolved areas
and h2Re is the value in fully resolved regions. On the other hand, the practical value
of interest for τ3 is the first one, whereas the other two prevent τ3 to blow up for
Rm→ ∞. Note that if we let h→ 0 the first term will be the minimum even for
high Rm numbers.2 The robustness of the stabilized FE formulation for advection-
dominated industrial applications can be found in [31,21,22,43,7].

2 We note that the continuous problem is singular for Rm = ∞. High magnetic Reynolds numbers
appear in astrophysical simulations. However, these simulations always involve transient systems, i.e. the
ideal MHD system (Rm = ∞) cannot be stated in steady form. Even though the numerical analysis in this
work has been restricted to the steady case for simplicity, the method has been conceived and numerically

7 Some comments on the nonlinear analysis

The numerical analysis of FE methods for the incompressible nonlinear MHD equa-
tions is a hard issue; let us recall that this system is obtained taking (a,d) as (u,ρb)
in (2.1). Using inf-sup stable elements, this analysis has been carried out in [42,
32]. It heavily uses the nice properties of Nédélec type FEs and cannot be applied
to nodal FEs. For weighted regularization techniques, the full nonlinear analysis has
been published in [34]. As stated by the authors, the results in three dimensions are
quite restrictive. Finally, a closer formulation to the one presented herein, based on
discontinuous Galerkin nodal FEs, is presented in [38]. However, both the numeri-
cal analysis and experiments (dealing with singular solutions) are for the linearized
problem only. The authors say that the nonlinear extension is an open problem, and
up to our knowledge it keeps open so far.

Therefore, the extension of the linearized analysis above to the nonlinear problem
is not straightforward. For the nonlinear problem, ah and dh are in fact the solution of
the previous iterate, when using a Picard-type linearization. Thus, we cannot assume
regularity over dh, namely dh ∈ Ld+ε(Ω)d for some ε > 0.

We may proceed by induction. Let us denote the iteration counter with a su-
perscript within parentheses. In the nonlinear version of system (2.1) for i ≥ 1 we
replace a← u(i−1)h , d← ρb

(i−1)
h , and denote the continuous solution of this problem

as (u(i−1),b(i−1), p(i−1),r(i−1)). Next, we obtain the new iterate (u(i)h ,b
(i)
h , p

(i)

solving the discretized problem (3.2). We assume in what follows that the physical
properties are such that this iterative scheme converges. Let us also assume that:

with θε(2) =

2+δ1(Ω)d for some

since C∩H(div;Ω) is compactly imbedded into L3+δ2(Ω), for some δ2 > 0 (see [42,

tested for the transient problem [7]. The first value in τ3 does not blow up for Rm = ∞ when applied to
transient problem, since it will include a time-step size δ t dependency when using a quasi-static approach
or a dynamic subgrid stabilization will be used (see [23] for details).

8 Numerical experimentation

The objective of the following numerical experiment is to compare the approxima-
tion of singular solutions for the MHD problem using several mesh structures. We
will show the difference between a mesh with a suitable macro-element structure, the
crossbox element, which has been observed numerically that verifies the approxima-
bility condition (5.5), against mesh structures that do not satisfy it, both in terms of
convergence rates and the solution itself.

The chosen problem with non-smooth solution corresponds to solve the MHD
equations in a nonconvex L-shaped domain Ω = (−1,1)× (−1,1) \ [0,1]× [0,−1].
Both the hydrodynamic and magnetic solutions have strong singularities at the re-
entrant corner, where the origin of coordinates is taken. The singular solution for the
Stokes operator is described in polar coordinates (r,θ) by

ux(x,y) =r

therefore, b /∈ H1(Ω)2 for n = 1.
This problem has been solved using several mesh structures. On one hand, we

have used meshes with a macro-element structure, namely the crossbox element,
which satisfies the approximability condition (5.5). On the other hand, we have used
meshes composed of linear elements, both triangular meshes (P1) and quadrilateral
meshes (Q1) that do not verify (5.5). Figure 8.1 shows an example of the three dif-
ferent mesh structures for h = 2−2. Moreover, let us stress that we have solved the
problem fully coupled with a nonlinear tolerance of 10−4 and setting every physical
parameter to 1.

For the three cases, the problem has been solved in several meshes with different
mesh sizes, from the coarsest one with h = 2−2 to the finest one with h = 2−10, which
consists of 12,58 million elements for the mesh composed of crossbox elements. Ta-
bles 8.1-8.6 contain the numerical error norms of the hydrodynamical and magnetic
variables for the three cases, crossbox, P1 and Q1 elements respectively. In Tables
8.1, 8.3 and 8.5, related to the hydrodynamical variables, we show the numerical er-
rors for the velocity in the L2-norm and the H1-norm, and the error for the pressure
in the L2-norm. In Tables 8.2, 8.4 and 8.6, related to the magnetic unknowns, we
have listed the numerical errors for the magnetic induction in the L2-norm and the
H(curl)-norm, and the errors for the magnetic pseudo-pressure in both the L2-norm
and the H1-norm. Furthermore, Figure 8.2 shows the convergence plots of the com-
puted numerical errors. It is clearly seen that using a mesh with a macro-element
structure is crucial in order to obtain the theoretical convergence rates to singular so-
lutions. It is also shown that linear elements, both P1 and Q1 meshes, have a much
lower convergence rate.

(d) Magnetic pseudo-pressure

Fig. 8.2 Convergence plots for h-refinement. Results for velocity, pressure, magnetic induction and mag-
netic pseudo-pressure and the three different meshes.

However, when using meshes of linear elements, both P1 and Q1, the method
provides a solution for the magnetic induction b with spurious discontinuities around
the corner. Figure 8.3 displays the magnetic induction solution for the three different
mesh structures. Besides, Figure 8.4 shows a zoom of the same magnetic induction
fields around the corner in order to highlight the discontinuities that appear when
computing with meshes that do not satisfy condition (5.5).

Finally, we observe that 1) the convergence rates for ‖∇eu‖, ‖ep‖, ‖eb‖ and ‖∇er‖
are exactly those predicted by the numerical analysis of the uncoupled stabilized
Stokes and Maxwell problems, 2) super-convergence is observed for the error quan-
tities ‖eu‖ and ‖∇× eb‖. In fact, we can infer from the numerical analysis that the
error due to the coupling term is affected by the two quantities that exhibit super-
convergence. As a result, the coupling terms are small compared to those related to
the uncoupled fluid and magnetic sub-problems, leading to the first observation.

9 Conclusions

The finite element approximation of the resistive MHD problem in [7] has been an-
alyzed in this work. The formulation falls within the category of stabilized finite
element methods and, as such, is intended to avoid the need for using finite element
approximations satisfying the compatibility conditions of the continuous problem
and dealing with ranges of the physical parameters in which first order derivatives
dominate second order ones.



Analysis of a finite element formulation for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics 25

Particular features of the formulation analyzed are that it is of residual type, can be
based on the VMS framework and the stabilization parameters are designed from the
numerical analysis, accounting for the coupling between the fluid and magnetic sub-
problems. However, the most salient feature is that it allows to converge to singular
solutions even when using a continuous Lagrangian approximation for the magnetic
induction field. To our knowledge, this is the first time this is achieved. From the
technical point of view, this possibility relies on the fact that we mimic the correct
functional setting of the continuous problem at the discrete level.

The stability and convergence analysis in this work support the feasibility of our
formulation, and complements the numerical experimentation in [7]. We have re-
stricted ourselves to some simplifying assumptions (quasi-uniform meshes, constant
stabilization parameters, conforming finite element spaces) which have allowed us
to avoid excessive technicalities but to highlight the main analytical reasons for the
success of our formulation.3
