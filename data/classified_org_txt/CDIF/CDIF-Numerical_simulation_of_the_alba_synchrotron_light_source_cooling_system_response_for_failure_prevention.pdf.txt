Abstract 
The ALBA Synchrotron Light Source cooling system is 

designed with a common return pipe that interconnects 
the four consumption rings. Such configuration is be-
lieved to compromise its optimal operation. To understand 
its thermo-fluid dynamic behaviour, a detailed 1D model 
has been built comprising all the components such as the 
pipes, fittings, bends, valves, pumping stations, heat ex-
changers and so on, and the various regulation mecha-
nisms. Preliminarily, the model results in steady state 
operating conditions have been compared with experi-
mental measurements and the maximum deviations have 
been found below 13%. Then, a series of transient numer-
ical simulations have been carried out to determine the 
system response. Specifically, effects of the blockage and 
leakage of a consumption line as well as the increase and 
decrease of heat duty for the tunnel rings have been inves-
tigated. As a result, the stability of the system has been 
evaluated and the operational limits have been estimated 
in front of hydraulic and thermal load variations. Moreo-
ver, particular behaviours have been identified which can 
be used to design monitoring and control strategies to 
prevent unexpected failures. 

INTRODUCTION 
The ALBA Synchrotron Light Source cooling system 

presents a common return pipe that interconnects the four 
consumption rings as outlined in Fig. 1. This design con-
figuration introduces complexity to the system behaviour 
because strong interdependency among them exists. 

As clearly exposed by Swetin [1], it is imperative that 
water flow and temperature are both maintained with a 
high degree of reliability because most accelerator com-
ponents are interlocked. In particular, it is necessary to 
understand the system behaviour when facing typical 
piping problems like blockages or leakages to prevent 
failures. Moreover, the capacity of the system to respond 
against temporary changes in the required thermal loads 
must be checked out. 

The motivation of such knowledge is to develop and 
apply correct monitoring and maintenance strategies to 
optimise system operation and reliability. It is also neces-
sary in order to allow upgrades that improve reliability 
and integrate new operating parameters. 

Consequently, a numerical simulation appears as an 
economic and reliable procedure if a preliminary adjust-
ment is carried out to guarantee the accuracy. For that 
purpose, the Flowmaster  software has been chosen 
because it has been successfully used to simulate complex 
fluid networks and advanced control systems as demon-
strated in the work of Sprengel [2]. 

NUMERICAL MODEL 
A complete model of the generation side of the cooling 

system has been built up with typical elements such as 
pipes, junctions, bends, transitions and valves. More par-
ticular elements are the pumps, the heat exchangers, the 
storage tank and the expansion tank. The consumption 
side, comprising the four rings, has been simplified due to 
its complexity to a heat exchanger component with the 
corresponding total heat duty. The properties of each 
component have been defined from information provided 
by the manufacturer as well as from data obtained by 
visual inspections and measurements in-situ. Details and 
images of the current model can be found in [3]. 

 
Figure 1: Outline of the ALBA cooling system. 

The main regulation systems which correspond to the 
three-way valves (V3V’s) for mixed water temperature at 
23 C, the heat exchangers (EX07) for cooling at 21 C 
and the pump engine frequency converters for limiting the 
delivery pressures have been modelled with PID ele-
ments. The four pumping stations have been named P07, 
P08, P09 and P10 for the Experimental Area (EA), the 
Storage (SR), the Booster (BO) and the Service Area (SA) 
consumption rings, respectively. 

In order to certify the accuracy of the model, the simu-
lated results under steady state conditions were compared 
with on-site measured data indicated in Table 1. The hy-
draulic variables showed maximum deviations around 6 
% and the thermal variables around 13%.

SIMULATED RESPONSE 
Thermal Load Shut-down 

The outlet temperature of the SR has been reduced 
from its nominal level of 25.6 C until 23.4 C as if no 
heat duty demand existed. The evolution of the V3V’s 
water temperatures takes 540 s to stabilize as observed in 
Fig. 2. 

 
Figure 2: Temperature evolution due to the SR’s thermal 
load shut-down. 

Initially, the outlet temperature reduction takes around 
80 s to affect progressively the mixed flow temperatures 
from the closest pumping station until the furthest one to 
the common return pipe. The regulation system reacts 
reducing the cold flow from the tank and simultaneously 
increasing the hotter flow from the common return. At the 
same time, the increased demand of water from the com-
mon return by the V3V’s provokes a reduction of the 
suction flow rate of the pumping station P11. Such reduc-
tion is automatically compensated by an equivalent in-
crease of flow from the storage tank to the P11 suction 
pipe through the bidirectional connection. As shown in 
Fig. 3, all the pumping stations suffer a reduction of the 
suction pressure. 

 
Figure 3: Pumps’ suction pressures evolution during the 
SR’s thermal load shut-down. 

Thermal Load Start-up 
The SR’s outlet temperature has been increased pro-

gressively during 540 s from 23.4 °C at around 600 s to 
25.5 °C. This transient is initially felt at around 680 s by 
the V3V’s. As a response, the suction of cold water from 
the tank is increased and the one from the return flow is 
decreased. Consequently, the common return flow rate 
increases again and the flow through the bidirectional line 
is reduced. Regarding the suction pressures, initially they 
increase again but later on they show a slight decrease. At 
the end of the process, all of the pumping stations’ suction 
pressures have increased significantly as shown in Fig. 4. 

 
Figure 4: Pumps’ suction pressures evolution during the 
SR’s thermal load start-up. 

Pipe Blockage 
At constant heat duty, the SR valve has been progres-

sively closed and thus provoking a flow rate reduction 
from its nominal value of 271.1 m3/h until a 20 % reduc-
tion in approximately 190 s. As shown in Fig. 5, this pro-
cedure has been forced with two different closure laws, 
first fast and second slow, owing to the fact that the flow 
rate is not significantly reduced until the valve ratio is 
below 0.2. 

 
Figure 5: Evolution of the closure of the SR’s outlet valve 
and of the resulting flow rate reduction. 

The initial change of valve position provokes an imme-
diate effect on the hydraulic parameters but the system 
thermal response is delayed because the consequent in-
crease of the SR’s outlet temperature takes 80 s to reach 
the V3V’s. 

Regarding the hydraulic response, a significant increase 
of the P08 suction pressure is provoked that is also ob-
served in the rest of pumps but with lower amplitudes as 
shown in Fig. 6. Simultaneously, the temperature of the

mixed flow decreases because less flow arrives from the 
common return. As a result, the regulation starts to close 
the tank flow at the V3V’s. At the same time, the flow 
from the tank towards P11 also increases to compensate 
the flow rate reduction at the common return pipe. 

 
Figure 6: Pumps’ suction pressures evolution during the 
SR’s pipe blockage. 

Due to the delayed thermal response, the pump suction 
pressures and the flow rate at the bidirectional connection 
decrease slighty, although they stabilize with a higher 
level than the initial one. Therefore, only the P08’s suc-
tion pressure has increased significantly than the rest at 
the end. 

Pipe Leakage 
A leakage at the inlet of the SR that increases steadily 

during 400 s to reach a continuous flow rate loss of 0.8 
m3/h has been forced. Previous simulations have been 
carried out to determine the minimum leakage that de-
creases the return pressure until 1.6 bar which is the min-
imum admissible return pressure.  

In general terms, the suction pressures at the pumping 
stations also decrease provoking an increase of the 
pumps’ rotational speed as well as the rings’ flowrate as 
shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that the P08 supplies the 
leaked flow which is almost entirely provided by the 
expansion tank. The remainder as well as the increase of 
the ring’s flowrate is supplied by the storage tank through 
the mixing valves.  

In addition, the ascending flow rate through the bidirec-
tional connection decreases to compensate the increase of 
the ring’s flow rate, which does not provoke any signifi-
cant thermal transient. 

Finally, when the return’s pressure reaches the value of 
1.6 bar the expansion tank is unable to supply the leakage 
flow. At this point, an external pump (P21) would start 
injecting water stored in an emergency reservoir.

SR’s pipe leakage. 

CONCLUSION 
An accurate 1D model of the ALBA Synchrotron Light 

Source cooling system has been built that permits to eval-
uate the response to hydraulic or thermal transients. 

The system response to a thermal load shut-down and 
start-up, to a ring blockage and to a ring leakage have 
been simulated and investigated in the SR. It has been 
predicted that the hydraulic transients propagate immedi-
ately through the entire network. Meanwhile, the thermal 
transients travel with the flow and they require a certain 
time to reach other zones. The common return design 
enhances the interaction between rings so that the transi-
ents affecting large flow rates propagate their effects to 
the rest of rings. 

The current results indicate that thermal stability is 
guaranteed during thermal start-up and shut down. For 
hydraulic stability, it is required that the expansion tank 
copes with the pressure fluctuations provoked by the 
transients. The existence of a flow blockage or leakage at 
any ring can be identified from the behaviour of the 
pumps’ suction pressure. Therefore, their monitoring and 
control should be used for detection and prevention of 
unexpected operating changes or failures in the pipes.
