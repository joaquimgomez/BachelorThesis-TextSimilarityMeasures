ABSTRACT 
 
The behavior of suction side leading edge cavitation on the runner blades of the GAMM Francis turbine has been investigated 
under different operating conditions at the best efficiency point (BEP) and at off-design operations. Steady state numerical 
simulations have been carried out with the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) two-phase model and with the Shear Stress Transport 
(SST) turbulence model available in ANSYSÔÉí CFX. The numerical model had been previously validated at BEP by comparing 
the cavity size and location, the pressure drop and the torque with experimental values obtained in a reduced scale model test 
utility. These results obtained at BEP have now been compared with analogous results calculated at different flow rates and 
heads. In particular, the runner flow has been computed at part load and at high load while keeping the nominal head. For that, 
the flow rate and the incidence angle of the inlet absolute velocity has been changed according to the corresponding guide vane 
opening angle. Furthermore, other operation conditions comprising higher and lower heads than the nominal one have also been 
considered, while keeping the angle of the inlet absolute velocity constant as if the guide vane position were the same for all the 
cases. The results show that the size of leading edge cavitation decreases significantly for operating conditions with lower flow 
rates and heads than the BEP. Meanwhile, similar cavitation developments are found for operating conditions with higher flow 
rates and heads than the BEP.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Cavitation in hydraulic turbines is a very important hydrodynamic phenomenon that negatively affects their 
performance and may cause vibration, noise and erosion of the solid components. Therefore, cavitation has been an 
active topic for decades in the fields of hydrodynamics and turbomachinery, and its undying progress in simulation 
techniques and mechanism findings is expected. For a Francis turbine, it is evident that the runner design influences 
cavitation inception and development besides the operation conditions such as the machine setting level and the 
operating point [1]. The Francis turbine has the maximum efficiency up to 93-95% at best efficiency point (BEP), 
which declines at off-design conditions [2, 3]. The flow field also varies with operating conditions. Modern 
hydraulic turbines face the inconvenience associated with the variable demand on the energy market and the 
limitations of energy storage, leading to the need for flexibility in their operation. Consequently, hydraulic turbines 
are used for a wide range of operating regimes far from the operating point for which they have been designed. 
Moreover, radial-axial turbines (e.g. GAMM Francis turbine [4]) having a rotor with fixed pitch blades have a sharp 
drop in efficiency and severe pressure fluctuations at off-design operating regimes [5, 6]. Flow at off-design 
operations, such as part load and high load is not as stable as that of the BEP [7]. The operating conditions of Francis 
turbines are modified by changing the angular position of the guide vanes which adjusts the flow rate to meet the 
power required. The Francis turbine is designed to obtain the maximum hydraulic efficiency at one flow rate (i.e. 
BEP). However, turbine operation away from BEP develops instabilities and unsteady phenomena which reduce 
the overall efficiency of the turbine [2, 8]. To come closer to solving these problems, numerical and experimental 
research is still required to better understand the physics of the phenomenon [9]. 
 



 
 

3rd International Symposium of Cavitation and Multiphase Flow 

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYSÔÉí CFX incorporates the unsymmetrical cavitation model 
proposed by Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) [10], which is based on the interphase mass transfer, ÔøΩÃáÔøΩ, derived from 
the Rayleight-Plesset equation. The ZGB model has already been used and validated several times in research for 
numerical prediction of sheet cavitation with fairly good results [11-13], and it has also been used for the numerical 
simulations presented in this study, along with the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model available in 
ANSYSÔÉí CFX. To evaluate the behavior of suction side leading edge cavitation on the runner blades of a Francis 
turbine, the GAMM Francis model geometry and performance [14-16] were taken as a study case.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL DATA 
 

The GAMM Francis turbine, with a specific speed ùúà = 0.5, is characterized by a flow rate Q = 0.376 m3/s, a head H 
= 5.957 m, a rotating speed œâ = 52.36 rad/s, and a torque T = 388 Nm [16]. The hill diagram of the GAMM turbine 
is presented in Figure 1, represented by the discharge coefficient œÜref and head coefficient œàref, with regard to the 
IEC regulations [17]. The seven operation points studied in this work can be seen on the hill diagram, highlighted 
in red. The results obtained at BEP (Point 1, see Figure 1) have been compared with analogous results calculated at 
different flow rates and heads. Two different studies have been carried out, in the first one (highlighted in green, 
see Figure 1) the runner flow has been computed at part load (Point 4) and at high load (Point 5) while keeping the 
nominal head constant. In the second study (highlighted in orange, see Figure 1), four different operation conditions 
comprising higher and lower heads than the nominal one have been computed, while keeping the angle of the inlet 
absolute velocity, ÔÅ°, constant as if the guide vane position were the same for all the cases (Points 2, 3, 6 and 7).

The GAMM Francis turbine has a spiral casing which was designed to give a constant meridional velocity 
distribution, and in order to achieve well-defined inlet conditions, fillets were added on both sides of the distributor 
inlet. The distributor consists of 24 stay vanes and 24 guide vanes. The runner has 13 blades and an external diameter 
of 0.4 m, so the reference radius is Rref = 0.2 m. The draft tube has a simple geometry without any inner pillar. The 
pressure and velocity distribution measurements of the BEP and the off-design conditions were made at the inlet of 
the distributor, at the inlet of the runner, just after the runner blades, at the inlet of the draft tube and at the outlet of

the draft tube. The measurements were carried out using a 6 mm diameter five-hole pressure probe, which provides 
the three components of the local flow components and the local static pressure [14, 19]. 
 
CAVITATION SIMULATIONS 
 
Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) Cavitation Model 
 
To simulate the interphase mass transfer, ùëö, between the water and the vapor during vaporization and condensation 
the following Equations 1 and 2 are used respectively:

ùêπ  ùë§‚Ñéùëíùëõ ùëÉ ùëÉ       (2) 

 
where RB is the vapor bubble radius, Œ±nuc is the nucleation site volume fraction, Œ±v is the water vapor volume fraction, 
Pv is the saturated water vapor pressure, P is the local fluid pressure, and Fv and Fc are the empirical coefficients 
for vaporization and condensation, respectively. The default model constants in CFXÔÉ¢ are RB = 10-6 m, Œ±nuc = 5ÔÉó10-
4, Fv = 50 and Fc = 0.01. 
 
Computational Domain 
 
The turbine geometry in meridional plane is shown in Figure 2a. The stay vanes and the guide vanes were not 
considered in the computational domain. The runner fluid domain was bounded upstream by a cylindrical surface 
located in the middle of the distributor channel and extended downstream up to a circular surface in the draft tube 
channel as indicated in Figure 2b. To reduce computational effort and increase computation speed, a sector 
comprising only one inter-blade channel was created taking advantage of the rotational symmetry of the runner and 
the existence of 13 blades as shown in Figure 1c. Simulations were carried out using the Rotating Frames of 
Reference (RER) and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. The wall function method was used with 
the SST turbulence model to resolve the boundary layer with a relatively coarse mesh, which allowed to save CPU 
time and storage capacity. To validate such grid, a sensitivity analysis was first done with no cavitation model 
activated. The values simulated for head and torque showed a good agreement with the values from experimentation 
at BEP. As a result, the accurate mesh and the proper boundary conditions, necessary to predict the expected 
behavior, could be established in the model.

cavitation coefficient Sigma, œÉ, that was calculated with Equation 3 where g is the gravity:

With decreasing œÉ, the typical torque rise was correctly simulated (see Figure 3a).The leading edge cavity was 
simulated and visualized with an isosurface of Œ±v = 0.5. The location, size and shape of the simulated leading edge 
cavity at œÉ = 0.15 showed a good similarity with the visual observations in the reduced scale GAMM turbine model 
for œÉ = 0.14 [20], which was also in line with the works of Susan-Resiga et al. [13, 14].

turbine model at BEP for œÉ = 0.14 [20], (c) contours of absolute pressure and isosurface of Œ±v = 0.5 for œÉ = 0.15. 
 
To study at which extent the size and shape of leading edge cavitation changes as a result of the turbine off-design 
operation, two studies were carried out.

Firstly, the runner flow was computed at part load with a flow rate below the design flow rate (Point 4) and at high 
load with a flow rate above the design flow rate (Point 5) while keeping the nominal head constant at œàref = 1.07. In 
Figure 4, the leading edge cavity has been visualized with the Œ±v plotted on the suction side of the blade. It can be 
clearly observed how cavitation develops as œÉ decreases. The size of the contact region of the cavitation with the 
blade suction side is similar between the BEP and the P5 at high flow rate. On the contrary, the P4 at low flow rate 
shows significantly smaller cavities than the BEP for the same œÉ. 
 
Secondly, four different operation conditions (Points 2, 3, 6 and 7) comprising higher and lower heads than the 
nominal one, while keeping Œ± = 25‚Å∞ as if the guide vane position were the same for all the cases, were computed. In 
Figure 5, the predicted leading edge cavity has been visualized with the Œ±v plotted on the suction side of the blade. 
It can be clearly observed how cavitation develops as œÉ decreases. However, for P2 with the lowest head and flow 
rate and for P6 closer to it but with slightly higher flow and head the cavitation only appears for very small œÉ values 
below 0.1. On the contrary, for P7 and P8, all the flow conditions present a significant leading edge cavity on the 
blade for any œÉ value up to 0.23.

3rd International Symposium of Cavitation and Multiphase Flow 

The general impression from the previous plots is that for all the operating conditions simulated at part load a lower 
extent of leading edge cavitation develops on the blade. Under such conditions (Points 2, 4 and 6), cavitation 
inception takes place for lower œÉ values than for the rest of cases (Points 1, 3, 5, 7). To confirm such conclusion, 
the entire runner showing the 3D shape and location of the predicted cavitation has been plotted in Figure 6 for all 
operating points at similar œÉ values around 0.15. It must be noted that for points 1, 3 and 5 a draft tube vortex rope 
is also visualized because its core also suffers cavitation. 
 

 
 
Figure 6 Location and shape of cavitation for each operating point at œÉ around 0.15, shown with a green isosurface of Œ±v = 0.5. 

 
In order to quantify such differences, the area on the suction side of the blade with Œ±v ÔÇ≥ 0.5 has been measured and 
it has been plotted in Figure 7 as a function of œÉ for all the operating conditions. The plots shown in Figure 7 
demonstrate that the cavitation development is similar for all the points comprising the BEP and those with higher 
flow rates and heads than the nominal one, and that for lower flow rates and heads the cavitation development is 
significantly reduced. The different behavior between part load and high load conditions could be related to the 
significantly lower efficiency of the part load points. In particular, P2, P4 and P6 have ÔÅ® ÔÇ£ 0.885 but P1, P3, P5 and 
P7 have ÔÅ® ‚â• 0.905 as it can be checked from the values presented in Table 1. 
 
The similar cavitation development observed by all the operating points at nominal condition and at higher flow 
rates and heads than the BEP has permitted to infer a mathematical expression of the total cavitation area on the 
blade as a function of ÔÅ≥. The study of the numerical results has indicated that an exponential law gives the best fit 
to the data points with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.98. The obtained Equation (4) giving a predicted area 
on the blade with ÔÅ°v ÔÇ≥ 0.5 is the following one:

The predicted values given by Equation (4) have been plotted together with the simulated results for BEP and 
Points 3, 5 and 7 in Figure 8 showing a very good agreement.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Inlet cavitation on the suction side of the runner blades of the GAMM Francis turbine has been simulated at BEP 
and at various off-design operating conditions both at part loads and high loads. The ZGB cavitation model and the 
SST turbulence model have been used to carry out the steady state calculations. The numerical model has been 
proved to give reliable results at BEP by comparison with flow visualizations obtained from reduced scale 
experimental tests. The simulations show that, keeping the same ÔÅ≥, the size of the leading edge cavitation decreases 
significantly for part load operating conditions (lower flow rates and heads than the BEP), but it is similar for high 
load operating conditions (higher flow rates and heads than the BEP). As a result, a mathematical expression to 
predict the area of the blade with cavitation as a function of ÔÅ≥ has been obtained for BEP and off-design operation 
conditions at high loads.
