1. Introduction 

Pumped storage hydropower plants are of paramount importance for the stability of 
the electrical grid. They can store huge amounts of energy by pumping water from a 
lower to a higher reservoir (pump operation) converting the surplus of electrical energy 
into potential energy [1]. At peak hours or in case of emergency this potential energy is 
converted again into electrical energy and delivered to the grid. 

The machines used in these power plants are generally reversible pump-turbines 
(RPT). RPT are high performance machines that have to change operation from pump 
to turbine mode (reversing runner rotation and flow direction) in a short time. Due to 
their special design characteristics (large power concentration) and operating 
conditions, they generate large dynamic forces when in operation. In the last years, 
due to the massive entrance of wind power, the number of start/stop cycles of RPT has 
increased dramatically as well as the operation at off-design conditions subjecting the 
machine to large dynamic forces. The RPT rotating train and structure has to resist all 
these forces for a lifespan of several decades. In this new scenario, more cases of 
damage have been reported and a more advanced and effective vibration monitoring is 
necessary. 

Compared with a conventional hydro turbine these machines have less number of 
blades (6 to 9) and higher rotating speeds operating at high pressure. The main 
excitation phenomenon is the well-known rotor-stator interaction (RSI) [2-5]. This 
excitation occurs in other kind of turbomachinery [2], but is critical in RPT due to the 
low number of blades and to the high head (difference in altitude between the upper 
and the lower reservoir). In some studies [3, 6, 7], RSI is supposed to be the cause of 
the failures found. 

In this paper the vibration monitoring in RPT is analysed. The characteristics of the 
main excitation forces and the procedure used to select the monitoring parameters 
(spectral bands) are presented. An analysis of the vibration signatures measured in 
different machines as well as the main types of damage found after several year of 
monitoring are introduced and discussed. 

2. Vibration based condition monitoring system 

2.1 Description of the monitoring system 

Since 1992 several pump-turbine units have been monitored. A reversible pump-
turbine unit is a vertical shaft machine with a hydraulic turbine in the bottom and an 
electrical generator in the top. Typical RPT have three radial bearings, one in the 
turbine and two in the electrical generator, as well as one axial thrust bearing. For 
monitoring, sensors were located in all the bearings and in other positions depending 
on the machine (Figure 1).The signals from accelerometers and pressure sensors were 
acquired as well as the signals related to the operating conditions of the machine 
(head, distributor opening, pump/turbine operation).  

In the beginning off-line monitoring using data collectors were used. In 1998 remote 
on-line monitoring systems were installed in many of them (Figure 2). Acquisition 
systems MVX from Acoem were installed in each machine. The MVX systems are 
connected to the power plant internal LAN and then to the company network. Signals 
are acquired continually and from time to time sent to a Diagnostic Center where all the 
power plants are supervised. Overall levels and spectral bands are calculated and 
trended. In case of alarm, spectra are analysed and if necessary more advanced signal

treatments like wavelets are used as well as numerical simulation techniques. A huge 
data base is now available for analysis. 

2.2 Main excitation force (RSI) 

Some important aspects have to be understood when setting up a monitoring 
system. The most important is to know what forcing frequencies are generated by the 
machine components (turbine, fluid film bearings, generator, etc.). The excitation forces 
in hydraulic machinery can be classified according their origin as hydraulic, mechanical 
and electromagnetic. 

The mechanical forces generated are the typical of any rotating system like 
unbalance and misalignment [8, 9] but the hydraulic forces are different [10, 11]. 
Comparing a RPT unit with other hydraulic machines, the hydraulic forces (especially 
the Rotor-Stator Interaction) are much larger since the runner of these machines have 
fewer number of blades than in a Francis turbine and has to withstand high pressure. 

The highest vibration level in RPT units comes from the pressure fluctuation induced 
by the rotor stator interaction (RSI) [3,6,7,12]. Basically, RSI arises from the 
interference between the rotating blades of the runner and the stationary guide vanes.  

When the rotating blades of the rotor pass in front of the static vanes of the stator 
(see [4] for figure details) the pressure field in the gap between blades and vanes can 
be described as the superposition of all the combinations m, n [3, 4]: 

 

�����, �� 	 
�� � cos������ � ∅�� � cos������ � ∅��	���	� 	 1,2, … ,∞		� 	 1,2, … ,∞ (1) 

 

In Eq.(1), � is the angular coordinate (index s is for stationary coordinate and r for 
rotating coordinate), �� is the number of guide vanes in the stationary part and �� the 
number of rotating blades in the runner.	�, � are entire numbers that represent the 
order of harmonic. The amplitude of the excitation 
��	depends on several parameters 
like the head (difference in altitude between the upper and the lower reservoir), position 
of the distributor (operating point), design of the machine and order of harmonics �, �. 

Analysing this equation in detail and rewriting it in the stationary reference frame [3, 
4] , the following main conclusions can be extracted: 

• Due to this interaction, several harmonic frequencies are excited. Viewed 
from the stationary frame, these frequencies depend on the rotating speed of 
the rotor (runner) � , the number of rotating blades �� and the order of 
harmonic � 

 
�� 	 � � �� � �  (2) 

  
• The blade passing frequency is defined as ��!" 	 �� 	 �� � �  
• The excitation shape corresponding to one excited frequency �� is the 

superposition of several excitation modes that can be calculated with the 
following expression: 
 

# 	 ��� $ ���  (3) 
 

• Higher amplitudes are expected for lower	|#| and lower harmonics m,n. 
Therefore and due to hydraulic design conditions of RPT’s (number of rotating 
blades and guide vanes), usually the highest value 
�� is obtained for m=1 
and n=2, 3, which usually gives a k=2, 3.  



4 
 

• The sign of # indicates the rotation of the frequency pulsation.  If it is positive 
the pressure pulsation rotates in the same direction than the runner and in 
the opposite when it is negative. 

2.3 Analysis of the vibration signatures  

For an effective condition monitoring the vibration signatures have to be known. 
RPT are not standard radial turbines (Francis), compared to them, RPT have less 
number of blades in the runner, higher heads and higher rotating speeds. Depending 
on the head and on the discharge, different phenomena can occur with significant 
changes in the vibration signatures. 

In Figure 3, two vibration signatures are compared, one belonging to a standard 
Francis turbine (375rpm, Zb=14, Zv=20) and one belonging to a RPT (500rpm, Zb=9, 
Zv=20). In both cases vibration was measured in the turbine bearing. It can be seen 
that while the hydraulic excitation in the Francis turbine appears at the blade passing 
frequency fb (# 	 6�, in the RPT appears at 2·fb (# 	 2) with a much higher amplitude. 

The main characteristics of the machines analysed in this study and predicted 
predominant frequency for each machine are indicated in Table 1. The predicted 
predominant frequency is calculated according to the RSI characteristic analysis (see 
chap. 2.2).  

In Figure 4, the theoretical predominant frequency according to the RSI analysis is 
validated experimentally for RPT-1 and RPT-3. The higher vibrations occur at 140 Hz 
(2fb ) in RPT-1 and at 168.75 Hz (3fb) in RPT-2 . The amplitudes depends very much 
on the operating mode and on the power delivered by the machine Figure 4a. These 
amplitudes are at maximum for full power turbine operation and higher than in pump 
operation mode (Figure 4b). This makes the monitoring of RPT more complex, 
because it is necessary to distinguish between changes due to operating conditions 
and changes due to damage. 

In the generator bearing (Figure 4c), vibration amplitudes are lower and signatures 
are different. In this case the predominant frequency is �  (unbalance), although the 
hydraulic excitation due to RSI can also be detected. 

2.4 Selection of spectral bands 

Like in other rotating machinery properly specified spectral alarm bands are one of 
the most critical tools to detect potentially serious problems in hydraulic turbines. 
Spectral bands were selected for the monitoring of RPT after a detailed analysis of the 
excitation forces and of the dynamic characteristics of the machines. To properly set up 
the spectral bands it is necessary to understand what problems are detectable by 
vibration analysis in each measuring position. It is known that mass unbalance, 
misalignment, bearing wear, hydraulic forces and some electrical problems can be 
detected rather easily treating the vibration signals. 

RPT are vertical shaft machines with three radial fluid film bearings connected to 
foundation and one vertical thrust bearing. The turbine and the generator are 
connected by a rigid coupling. The turbine bearing withstand mechanical and hydraulic 
forces while the two generator bearings withstand mechanical and electromagnetic 
forces. Spectral bands in the generator bearings and in the turbine bearing are 
selected according to each type of forces.

2.4.1 Generator bearing 

A sub-harmonic band id selected to detect bearing damage. Damage in fluid film 
bearings may generate sub-synchronous vibration as well as multiple harmonics if in 
latter stages of bearing wear [13, 14]. The �  band was selected to control the 
unbalance [13, 15]. �  can be calculated according to Eq.(4) 

60rpmff Ν=  (4) 

The 2�  and 3�  band was introduced to detect misalignment of the shaft [16]. The 
next band, (�'()�-band was chosen to monitor damage in the bearing itself. The 
predicted frequency in this case can be calculated with the following expression 
(Eq.(5)) [13]. 

fpadpad fzf ⋅=  (5) 

where zpad is the number of bearing pads. Therefore the frequency range of this 
band depends on the type of bearing. The N-harmonics band was used to control 
possible bearing wear or excessive clearance on the bearings [13] . A band containing 
�'*+ [13] was selected to detect electrical damage in the generator.  

�'*+ 	 2 � �+,�- (6) 
 

where fline is the frequency of the electrical grid. Moreover, a band containing 2�'*+ is 
set to control the first harmonic of �'*+. Finally a band containing the RSI main 
frequency (usually 2�� and 3 �� in RPT) was selected to monitor the hydraulic 
excitation. Nevertheless, this band can be easily controlled from the turbine bearing. 
The spectral band selection of this bearing can be summarized in Table 2. 

2.4.2 Turbine bearing 

For the turbine bearing a sub-harmonic band to detect bearing damage and 
cavitation rope was chosen [17-19]. The cavitation rope may appear in the draft tube 
(outlet of the turbine in generating mode) at low loads and generates low frequency 
pressure pulsations ���. In conventional hydraulic turbines many types of cavitation are 
possible but one of the most characteristics is the draft tube vortex rope 

��� 	 �0.2 1 0.3��  (7) 

The �  band and the 2� -3�  are selected again to control unbalance and misalignment 
of the shaft. If the machine is working around the best efficiency point the main 
hydraulic forces are generated by the RSI which is much more important than 
unbalance. The ��- band contains the fundamental harmonic frequency of the RSI 
excitation. Although for conventional Francis turbines this is the predominant hydraulic 
frequency, for RPT machines sometimes this frequency is almost not detected. 

The most important band to detect hydraulic problems and changes in the machine 
operating conditions is the � � ��- band. The calculation of � that gives the predominant 
frequency is explained in [3,4, 20] and in chap. 2.2 of this paper. As mentioned before 
this �	is usually 2 or 3 for a RPT. Higher harmonics of the  �� band (��-harmonics) was 
also selected to control changes in the RSI characteristic.  

Furthermore, a middle band is considered to detect turbulence or possible excited 
natural frequencies of the rotor[13]. Also, a final band is taken into account to monitor 
possible cavitation frequencies[13, 19]. The band selection for the turbine bearing can 
be summarized in Table 3. 

In Figure 5 an example of band selection based on these criteria for the RPT-1 is 
shown.

3. Vibration levels 

3.1 Overall levels 

The specification of overall vibration alarm levels in rotating machinery is not a 
simple task. This work is carried out by international committees where professionals 
with expertise are establishing the reference criteria. ISO-10816-5 Standards “Machine 
sets in hydraulic power generating and pumping plants Group 3” are the ones more 
related to RPT, because RPT are vertical shaft machines with bearing housings 
normally all braced against the foundation. To be in zone A and B of these standards 
(unlimited operating time) overall levels should be below 2.6 mm/s rms. If vibration 
level is more than 4 mm/s RMS would be in zone D what is normally considered to be 
of sufficient severity to cause damage to the machine. Compared with Standards some 
of the machines analysed had larger amplitudes due to RSI with overall levels higher 
than 2.6mm/s rms. Even with these high levels machines have been in operation for 
many years without serious problems. Therefore the overall alarm and trip levels have 
to be selected according to the machine design and operating mode. 

Before selecting levels it is convenient to know the vibration characteristics of these 
machines. One of the characteristics is that vibration levels are generally larger in the 
turbine bearing than in the generator bearings because the main excitation RSI acts on 
the runner and the maximum response is in this bearing. In Figure 6, the trending of 
overall vibration levels in all bearings of two RPT with different design is shown. 
Comparing the amplitudes it can be seen that vibration levels are much higher in the 
turbine bearing than in the other bearing. Another characteristic is that vibration levels 
depend on the operating mode (as a turbine or as a pump) and on the delivered power 
(Figure 7). 

Consequently when a new unit starts to run, before selecting the alarm and trip 
levels some preliminary measurements have to be performed both in turbine and in 
pumping mode. Unless the machine operates at very low load, the reference values 
have to be extracted from the measurements taken when machine is at maximum 
power. This is because the main excitation force (RSI) is at maximum when the 
machine is at full power. Only vibration levels measured with the machine operating at 
the same power can be compared and trended.  

3.2  Spectral band levels 

For a more accurate monitoring the spectral bands indicated above (Section 2.4) 
were used. When selecting the alarm levels in each band it has to be known if any 
change in levels is due to operating conditions or to damage. Therefore band vibration 
levels have to be trended for a determined machine power. Normally one data base is 
for vibrations measured at full power, one for vibrations measured around nominal 
power and another for vibrations measured at minimum power. For measurements 
taken with the machine operating with the same power, no significant changes in band 
levels are expected except for the RSI band. Changes in the other bands would be 
indicative of damage. Some examples are provided in the following paragraphs.    

Vibration levels selected at first were of 0.2mm/s rms for the sub-synchronous 
bands and for unbalance 0.5mm/s rms in the turbine and 0.8mm/s rms in the 
generator. The RSI band had to be adapted to on-site measurements. In Figure 8, the 
vibration amplitudes at the RSI band for four machines of the same power plant have 
been represented. There are differences in vibration levels between machines even if 
they have the same design and installed in the same place. This is due to the fact that 
vibrations depend much on the structural response of the rotor; there are several 
natural frequencies around the excitation frequencies what may change the response 



7 
 

amplitude. Values between 0.3mm/s rms and 0.5mm/s rms were selected for the other 
bands. 

4. Analysis of vibration signatures after overhauls. 

The analysis of vibration signals before and after a repair is a good way to calibrate 
the symptoms and the alarm limits. Some typical cases of damage found are indicated 
in Table 4 and commented in the following paragraphs.  

4.1 Damage in generators 

The typical symptom of damage is vibration at two times the line frequency (100Hz). 
In Figure 9, the evolution of damage in the generator of a RPT has been represented. 
Changes in the vibration signature (spectra) and in the spectral bands can be 
observed. It can be seen that the band around two times the line frequency (100Hz) is 
increasing while the amplitudes of the other bands do not change. 

4.2 Wear in Bearings 

Wear in bearings is another typical damage. Families of sub-harmonics and 
harmonics appear in the spectrum (Figure 10). It can be seen that sub-harmonic and 
harmonic bands increase when damage worsens while the amplitude of the 100Hz 
spectral band remains the same. After repair all levels go down. 

4.3 Damage in bearing support 

Due to the large hydraulic excitation forces in the turbine all the machine bearings 
withstand large forces. In some cases these forces produce damage in bearings or in 
structure. In Figure 11 the vibrations generated by a reduction of stiffness in a radial 
bearing due to grouting damage can be observed. This is a very dangerous situation 
because the rotor natural frequencies decrease to the rotating frequency. 

4.4 Draft tube cavitation vortex detection 

When the turbine is operating off-design at part loads a cavitation vortex is 
generated at the exit of the turbine in the draft tube. This vortex generates low 
frequency pressure pulsations that propagate through the whole hydraulic system. 
These pressure pulsations can be amplified by hydraulic resonance generating large 
fluctuations in the turbine discharge producing instabilities in the operation of the 
turbine (Figure 12). 

4.5 Thrust bearing damage  

Damage in thrust bearing is another type of damage found. The symptom is the 
appearance of a vibration at the pad passing frequency. In Figure 13 the vibration 
signature measured axially in the thrust bearing has been represented. The pad 
passing frequency can be detected in the signature (fpad=Zpads·ff= 8·6.25=50 Hz) as well 
as the symptoms of damage in the generator. 

4.6 Typical unbalance after overhaul 

One of the advantages of remote vibration monitoring is to see is the machine is in 
good operating condition after an overhaul. In Figure 14 it can be seen that after a 
repair of the generator the unbalance level had an important increase. After balancing 
the levels decreased as expected. 



8 
 

4.7 Damage in runners 

Some typical types of damage have been easily detected but a few of them, 
especially the ones occurring in the runner, were hardly detectable [6].  

There are several reasons that make the runner prone to have damage. First, the 
runner is the part of the turbine that receives directly the strong pressure pulsations 
generated by RSI, second the maximum deformations in the runner occur at the 
external diameter in axial direction and third the excitation frequencies of RSI are in the 
range of the impeller natural frequencies. The runner vibrations can hardly be detected 
by monitoring vibrations in the bearing because natural frequencies of the runner do 
not produce important deformations in the rotor. In Figure 15, the deformations in a 
runner and rotor when excited by RSI have been represented. The numerical 
simulation done with FEM including the mass of water was checked experimentally. It 
can be observed that while the runner has large deformations, the rotor is very little 
affected. The strong deformations generate large stresses in the filets of the 
crown/blade connections where fatigue damage can be caused. Some cases have 
been found during monitoring. 

As indicated above, new renewable power plants (NRE) like wind generate 
intermittent energies what can destabilize the electrical grid. With rapidly expansion of 
NRE generation large hydro has to ensure grid stability. With this new scenario, in the 
last ten years the number of start-stops of these machines has increased dramatically. 
The consequence is an increase in damage in the motor/generator and in the turbine 
runner due to fatigue. 

The cracks are not detectable until the crack causes a part of the runner to break. 
Even then the symptoms (changes in unbalance and RSI excitation) can be so small 
that can go unnoticed by the monitoring system. In Figure 16 the change in unbalance 
produced by a broken runner is shown. The unbalance level with the damaged runner 
is still under the alarm limit. More sophisticated methods are required to detect runner 
vibration. 

5. Conclusions 

In this paper the vibration monitoring of large reversible pump-turbines (RPT) units 
have been analysed. The results obtained after 15 years of monitoring several power 
plants with this type of machines have been used for the analysis. The machines were 
monitored locating accelerometers in all the bearings and in some cases pressure 
transducers and proximity probes. Several acquisition systems were installed in each 
power plant (one for each machine) which are remotely connected to a diagnostic 
center. 

The main excitation forces were analysed. The vibration behaviour of RPT is quite 
different compared with conventional hydraulic turbines generating much larger 
vibration levels in the whole machine. The cause is the high pressure pulsations 
generated in the turbine by the interaction between the rotating blades of the impeller 
and the stationary vanes of the distributor named rotor/stator interaction (RSI). The 
method used to calculate the main excitation frequency that depends on the 
combination of runner blades and guide vanes is explained in the paper. 

For a deeper analysis of the RSI effects, vibration signatures measured in machines 
of different design (manufacturers) are introduced and commented. It is shown that the 
vibration levels of RPT are very dependent of the operating conditions. Vibration levels 
are at maximum when the machine is operating in turbine mode at maximum load. 

The procedure for the selection of the spectral bands and alarm levels used in RPT 
monitoring is indicated. The band upper frequency and the band lower frequency are 



9 
 

indicated depending on the rotating speed and on the number of runner blades and 
guide vanes. 

Some of the most typical types of damage found in these machines during these years 
of monitoring have been represented. Damage in generator, in radial and thrust 
bearings, cavitation, damage in structure and unbalance are introduced. The symptoms 
and the changes in the spectral band levels for all these types of damage are included. 

Due to the strong entrance of wind power supplying intermittent energy, the number 
of start-ups in these machines has increased dramatically affecting especially the 
runner where fatigue damage is not uncommon. The runner vibrations can hardly be 
detected by monitoring vibrations in the bearing because runner vibrations do not 
produce important deformations in the rotor. The number of breakdowns has increased 
and better vibration monitoring procedures are necessary especially to monitor the 
runner.

1. Introduction 

Pumped storage hydropower plants are of paramount importance for the stability of 
the electrical grid. They can store huge amounts of energy by pumping water from a 
lower to a higher reservoir (pump operation) converting the surplus of electrical energy 
into potential energy [1]. At peak hours or in case of emergency this potential energy is 
converted again into electrical energy and delivered to the grid. 

The machines used in these power plants are generally reversible pump-turbines 
(RPT). RPT are high performance machines that have to change operation from pump 
to turbine mode (reversing runner rotation and flow direction) in a short time. Due to 
their special design characteristics (large power concentration) and operating 
conditions, they generate large dynamic forces when in operation. In the last years, 
due to the massive entrance of wind power, the number of start/stop cycles of has 
increased dramatically as well as operation at off-design conditions. The PT rotating 
train and structure has to resist all these forces for a lifespan of several decades. In this 
new scenario, more cases of damage have been reported and an effective vibration 
monitoring is necessary. 

A PT is a special type of hydraulic turbomachine that has to be able to operate as a 
pump and as a turbine inverting the rotating sense and the flow direction. Compared 
with a conventional hydro turbine these machines have less number of blades (6 to 9) 
and higher rotating speeds operating at high pressure. The main excitation 
phenomenon is the well-known rotor-stator interaction (RSI) [2-5]. This excitation 
occurs in other kind of turbomachinery [2], but is critical in PT due to the low number of 
blades and to the high head (difference in altitude between the upper and the lower 
reservoir). In some studies [3, 6, 7], RSI is supposed to be the cause of the failures 
found. 

In this paper the vibration monitoring in RPT is analyzed. The characteristics of the 
main excitation forces and procedure used to select the monitoring parameters 
(spectral bands) are presented. An analysis of the vibration signatures measured in 
different machines as well as the main types of damage found after several year of 
monitoring are introduced and discussed. 

2. Vibration based condition monitoring system 

2.1 Description of the monitoring system 

Since 1992 several pump-turbine units have been monitored. A reversible pump-
turbine unit is a vertical shaft machine with a hydraulic turbine in the bottom and an 
electrical generator in the top. Typical RPT have three radial bearings, one in the 
turbine and two in the electrical generator, as well as one axial thrust bearing. For 
monitoring, sensors were located in all the bearings and in other positions depending 
on the machine (Figure 1).The signals from accelerometers and pressure sensors were 
acquired as well as the signals related to the operating conditions of the machine 
(head, distributor opening, pump/turbine operation).  

In 1998 remote on-line monitoring systems were installed in many of them design 
(Figure 2). Acquisition systems MVX from Acoem were installed in each machine. The 
MVX systems are connected to the power plant internal LAN and then to the company 
network. Signals are acquired continually and from time to time sent to a Diagnostic 
Center where all the power plants are supervised. Overall levels and spectral bands 
are calculated and trended. In case of alarm, spectra are analysed and if necessary 



3 
 

more advanced signal treatments like wavelets are used as well as simulation 
techniques. A huge data base is now available for analysis. 

2.2 Main excitation force (RSI) 

Some important aspects have to be understood when setting up a monitoring 
system. The most important is to know what forcing frequencies are generated by the 
machine components (turbine, fluid film bearings, generator, etc.). The excitation forces 
in hydraulic machinery can be classified according their origin as hydraulic, mechanical 
and electromagnetic. 

The mechanical forces generated are the typical of any rotating system like 
unbalance and misalignment [8, 9] but the hydraulic forces are different [10, 11]. 
Comparing a RPT unit with other hydraulic machines, the hydraulic forces (especially 
the Rotor-Stator Interaction) are much larger since the runner has less number of 
blades than in a Francis turbine and has to withstand high pressure. 

The highest vibration level in RPT units comes from the pressure fluctuation induced 
by the rotor stator interaction (RSI) [3,6,7,12]. Basically, RSI arises from the 
interference between the rotating blades of the runner and the stationary guide vanes.  

When the rotating blades of the rotor pass in front of the static vanes of the stator 
(see [4] for figure details) the pressure field in the gap between blades and vanes can 
be described as the superposition of all the combinations m, n [3, 4]: 

 

�����, �� 	 
�� � cos������ � ∅�� � cos������ � ∅��	���	� 	 1,2, … ,∞		� 	 1,2, … ,∞ (1) 

 

In Eq.(1), � is the angular coordinate (index s is for stationary coordinate and r for 
rotating coordinate), �� is the number of guide vanes in the stationary part and �� the 
number of rotating blades in the runner.	�, � are entire numbers that represent the 
order of harmonic. The amplitude of the excitation 
��	depends on several parameters 
like the head (difference in altitude between the upper and the lower reservoir), position 
of the distributor (operating point), design of the machine and order of harmonics �, �. 

Analysing this equation in detail and rewriting it in the stationary reference frame [3, 
4] , the following main conclusions can be extracted: 

• Due to this interaction, several harmonic frequencies are excited. Viewed 
from the stationary frame, these frequencies depend on the rotating speed of 
the rotor (runner) � , the number of rotating blades �� and the order of 
harmonic � 

 
�� 	 � � �� � �  (2) 

  
• The blade passing frequency is defined as ��!" 	 �� 	 �� � �  
• The excitation shape corresponding to one excited frequency �� is the 

superposition of several excitation modes that can be calculated with the 
following expression: 
 

# 	 ��� $ ���  (3) 
 

• Higher amplitudes are expected for lower	|#| and lower harmonics m,n. 
Therefore and due to hydraulic design conditions of RPT’s (number of rotating 
blades and guide vanes), usually the highest value 
�� is obtained for m=1 
and n=2, 3, which usually gives a k=2, 3.  



4 
 

• The sign of # indicates the rotation of the frequency pulsation.  If it is positive 
the pressure pulsation rotates in the same direction than the runner and in 
the opposite when it is negative. 

2.3 Analysis of the vibration signatures  

For an effective condition monitoring the vibration signatures have to be known. 
RPT are not standard radial turbines (Francis), compared to them, RPT have less 
number of blades in the runner, higher heads and higher rotating speeds. Depending 
on the head and on the discharge, different phenomena can occur with significant 
changes in the vibration signatures. 

In Figure 3, two vibration signatures are compared, one belonging to a standard 
Francis turbine (375rpm, Zb=14, Zv=20) and one belonging to a RPT (500rpm, Zb=9, 
Zv=20). In both cases vibration was measured in the turbine bearing. It can be seen 
that while the hydraulic excitation in the Francis turbine appears at the blade passing 
frequency fb (# 	 6�, in the RPT appears at 2·fb (# 	 2) with a much higher amplitude. 

The main characteristics of the machines analysed in this study and predicted 
predominant frequency for each machine are indicated in Table 1. The predicted 
predominant frequency is calculated according to the RSI characteristic analysis (see 
chap. 2.2).  

In Figure 4, the theoretical predominant frequency according to the RSI analysis is 
validated experimentally for RPT-1 and RPT-3. The higher vibrations occur at 140 Hz 
(2fb ) in RPT-1 and at 168.75 Hz (3fb) in RPT-2 . The amplitudes depends very much 
on the operating mode and on the power delivered by the machine Figure 4a. These 
amplitudes are at maximum for full power turbine operation and higher than in pump 
operation mode (Figure 4b). This makes the monitoring of RPT more complex, 
because it is necessary to distinguish between changes due to operating conditions 
and changes due to damage. 

In the generator bearing (Figure 4c), vibration amplitudes are lower and signatures 
are different. In this case the predominant frequency is �  (unbalance), although the 
hydraulic excitation due to RSI can also be detected. 

2.4 Selection of spectral bands and levels 

Like in other rotating machinery properly specified spectral alarm bands are one of 
the most critical tools to detect potentially serious problems in hydraulic turbines. 
Spectral bands were selected for the monitoring of RPT after a detailed analysis of the 
excitation forces and of the dynamic characteristics of the machines. To properly set up 
the spectral bands it is necessary to understand what problems are detectable by 
vibration analysis in each measuring position. It is known that mass unbalance, 
misalignment, bearing wear, hydraulic forces and some electrical problems can be 
detected rather easily treating the vibration signals. 

RPT are vertical shaft machines with three radial fluid film bearings connected to 
foundation and one vertical thrust bearing. The turbine and the generator are 
connected by a rigid coupling. The turbine bearing withstand mechanical and hydraulic 
forces while the two generator bearings withstand mechanical and electromagnetic 
forces. Spectral bands in the generator bearings and in the turbine bearing are 
selected according to each type of forces.  

In order to distinguish between a normal operation and damage a properly 
specification of levels is necessary. The specification of band alarm levels is even more 
complex. Some alarm levels have to be set up and modified after some time of 
monitoring.

2.4.1 Generator bearing 

A subharmonic band id selected to detect bearing damage. Damage in fluid film 
bearings may generate subsynchronous vibration as well as multiple harmonics if in 
latter stages of bearing wear [13, 14]. The �  band was selected to control the 
unbalance [13, 15]. �  can be calculated according to Eq.(4) 

60rpmff Ν=  (4) 

The 2�  and 3�  band was introduced to detect misalignment of the shaft [16]. The 
next band, (�'()�-band was chosen to monitor damage in the bearing itself. The 
predicted frequency in this case can be calculated with the following expression 
(Eq.(5)) [13]. 

fpadpad fzf ⋅=  (5) 

where zpad is the number of bearing pads. Therefore the frequency range of this 
band depends on the type of bearing. The N-harmonics band was used to control 
possible bearing wear or excessive clearance on the bearings [13] . A band containing 
�'*+ [13] was selected to detect electrical damage in the generator.  

�'*+ 	 2 � �+,�- (6) 
 

where fline is the frequency of the electrical grid. Moreover, a band containing 2�'*+ is 
set to control the first harmonic of �'*+. Finally a band containing the RSI main 
frequency (usually 2�� and 3 �� in RPT) was selected to monitor the hydraulic 
excitation. Nevertheless, this band can be easily controlled from the turbine bearing. 
The spectral band selection of this bearing can be summarized in Table 2. 

2.4.2 Turbine bearing 

For the turbine bearing a subharmonic band to detect bearing damage and 
cavitation rope was chosen[17-19]. The cavitation rope may appear in the draft tube 
(outlet of the turbine in generating mode) at low loads and generates low frequency 
pressure pulsations ���. In conventional hydraulic turbines many types of cavitation are 
possible but one of the most characteristics is the draft tube vortex rope 

��� 	 �0.2 1 0.3��  (7) 

The �  band and the 2� -3�  are selected again to control unbalance and misalignment 
of the shaft. If the machine is working around the best efficiency point the main 
hydraulic forces are generated by the RSI which is much more important than 
unbalance. The ��- band contains the fundamental harmonic frequency of the RSI 
excitation. Although for conventional Francis turbines this is the predominant hydraulic 
frequency, for RPT machines sometimes this frequency is almost not detected. 

The most important band to detect hydraulic problems and changes in the machine 
operating conditions is the � � ��- band. The calculation of � that gives the predominant 
frequency is explained in [3,4, 20] and in chap. 2.2 of this paper. As mentioned before 
this �	is usually 2 or 3 for a RPT. Higher harmonics of the  �� band (��-harmonics) was 
also selected to control changes in the RSI characteristic.  

Furthermore, a middle band is considered to detect turbulence or possible excited 
natural frequencies of the rotor[13]. Also, a final band is taken into account to monitor 
possible cavitation frequencies[13, 19]. The band selection for the turbine bearing can 
be summarized in Table 3. 



6 
 

In Figure 5 an example of band selection based on these criteria for the RPT-1 is 
shown. 

3. Vibration levels 

The specification of overall vibration alarm levels is not a simple task. This work is 
carried out by international committees where professionals with expertise are 
establishing the reference criteria. ISO-10816-5 Standards “Machine sets in hydraulic 
power generating and pumping plants Group 3” are the ones more related to RPT, 
because RPT are vertical shaft machines with bearing housings normally all braced 
against the foundation. To be in zone A and B of these standards (unlimited operating 
time) overall levels should be below 2.6 mm/s rms. If vibration level is more than 4 
mm/s RMS would be in zone D what is normally considered to be of sufficient severity 
to cause damage to the machine. 

In Figure 6, the trending of overall vibration levels in all bearings of two RPT with 
different design is shown. Comparing the amplitudes it can be seen that vibration levels 
are much higher in the turbine bearing than in the generator bearing. Some of the 
machines analysed have large amplitudes in the turbine bearing due to RSI with overall 
levels larger than 2.6mm/s rms. Even with these high levels machines have been in 
operation for many years without serious problems. Alarm and trip levels have to be 
selecting according to the machine design and data acquired. 

When selecting the alarm levels it has to be known if any change in levels is due to 
operating conditions or to damage, so the influence of the operating conditions on the 
vibration amplitudes has to be known. In RPT vibration levels depend much on the 
power delivered by the machine what can be clearly observed in Figure 7. When the 
opening degree of the distributor is at maximum (maximum power) vibration levels are 
at maximum. Therefore for monitoring, vibration levels have to be related to machine 
operating conditions. 

Vibration levels selected at first were of 0.2mm/s rms for the subsynchronous bands 
and for unbalance 0.5mm/s rms in the turbine and 0.8mm/s rms in the generator. The 
RSI band had to be adapted to experimental measurements. In Figure 8, the vibration 
amplitudes at the RSI band for four machines of the same power plant have been 
represented. There are differences in vibration levels between machines even if they 
have the same design and installed in the same place. This is due to the fact that 
vibrations depend much on the structural response of the rotor; there are several 
natural frequencies around the excitation frequencies what may change the response 
amplitude. Values between 0.3mm/s rms and 0.4mm/s rms were selected for the other 
bands.  

4. Analysis of vibrations in overhauls. 

The analysis of vibration signals before and after a repair is a good way to calibrate 
the symptoms and the alarm limits. Some typical cases of damage found are 
commented in the following paragraphs. As indicated above, new renewable power 
plants (NRE) like wind generate intermittent energies what can destabilize the electrical 
grid. With rapidly expansion of NRE generation large hydro has to ensure grid stability. 
With this new scenario, in the last 10 the number of start-stops of these machines has 
increased dramatically. The consequence is an increase in damage in the 
motor/generator and in the turbine runner due to fatigue. 

4.1 Damage in generators 

The typical symptom of damage is vibration at two times the line frequency (100Hz). 
In Figure 9, the evolution of damage in the generator of a RPT has been represented. 



7 
 

Changes in the vibration signature (spectra) and in the spectral bands can be 
observed. It can be seen that the band around two times the line frequency (100Hz) is 
increasing while the amplitudes of the other bands do not change. 

4.2 Wear in Bearings 

Wear in bearings is another typical damage. Families of sub-harmonics and 
harmonics appear in the spectrum (Figure 10). It can be seen that sub-harmonic and 
harmonic bands increase when damage worsens while the amplitude of the 100Hz 
spectral band remains the same. After repair all levels go down. 

4.3 Damage in bearing support 

Due to the large hydraulic excitation forces in the turbine all the machine bearings 
withstand large forces. In some cases these forces produce damage in bearings or in 
structure. In Figure 11 the vibrations generated by a reduction of stiffness in a radial 
bearing due to grouting damage can be observed. This is a very dangerous situation 
because the rotor natural frequencies decrease to the rotating frequency. 

4.4 Draft tube cavitation vortex detection 

When the turbine is operating off-design at part loads a cavitation vortex is 
generated at the exit of the turbine in the draft tube. This vortex generates low 
frequency pressure pulsations that propagate through the whole hydraulic system. 
These pressure pulsations can be amplified by hydraulic resonance generating large 
fluctuations in the turbine discharge producing instabilities in the operation of the 
turbine (Figure 12). 

4.5 Thrust bearing damage  

Damage in thrust bearing is another type of damage found. The symptom is the 
appearance of a vibration at the pad passing frequency. In Figure 13 the vibration 
signature measured axially in the thrust bearing has been represented. The pad 
passing frequency can be detected in the signature (fpad=Zpads·ff= 8·6.25=50 Hz) as well 
as the symptoms of damage in the generator. 

4.6 Typical unbalance after overhaul 

One of the advantages of remote vibration monitoring is to see is the machine is in 
good operating condition after an overhaul. In Figure 14 it can be seen that after a 
repair of the generator the unbalance level had an important increase. After balancing 
the levels decreased as expected. 

4.7 Damage in runners 

Some typical types of damage have been easily detected but a few of them, 
especially the ones occurring in the runner, were hardly detectable [6]. There are 
several reasons that make the runner prone to have damage. First, the runner is the 
part of the turbine that receives directly the strong pressure pulsations generated by 
RSI, second the maximum deformations in the runner occur at the external diameter in 
axial direction and third the excitation frequencies of RSI are in the range of the 
impeller natural frequencies. The runner vibrations can hardly be detected by 
monitoring vibrations in the bearing because natural frequencies of the runner do not 
produce important deformations in the rotor. In Figure 16, the deformations in a runner 
and rotor when excited by RSI have been represented. The numerical simulation done 



8 
 

with FEM including the mass of water was checked experimentally. It can be observed 
that while the runner has large deformations, the rotor is very little affected. The strong 
deformations generate large stresses in the filets of the crown/blade connections where 
fatigue damage can be caused. Some cases have been found during monitoring. 

The cracks are not detectable until the crack causes a part of the runner to break. 
Even then the symptoms (changes in unbalance and RSI excitation) can be so small 
that can go unnoticed by the monitoring system. In Figure 16 the change in unbalance 
produced by a broken runner is shown. The unbalance level with the damaged runner 
is still under the alarm limit. More sophisticated methods are required to detect runner 
vibration.  

5. Conclusions 

Hydraulic turbines used in pumped storage are reversible machines that can 
operate as a pump and as a turbine. They are fundamental for the stability of the 
electrical grid where consumption and generation have to be matched. They can 
start/stop rapidly absorbing the surplus of energy from the grid or supplying energy to 
the grid. Due to the strong entrance of wind power supplying intermittent energy, the 
number of start-ups in these machines has increased dramatically in the last ten years. 
The number of breakdowns has increased and vibration monitoring is more necessary 
than ever. 

In this paper the vibration monitoring of large reversible pump-turbines (RPT) units 
have been analysed. The results obtained after 15 years of monitoring several power 
plants with this type of machines have been used for the analysis. The machines were 
monitored locating accelerometers in all the bearings and in some cases pressure 
transducers and proximity probes. Several acquisition systems were installed in each 
power plant (one for each machine) which are remotely connected to a diagnostic 
center.  

The main excitation forces were analysed. The vibration behaviour of RPT is quite 
different compared with conventional hydraulic turbines generating much larger 
vibration levels in the whole machine. The cause is the high pressure pulsations 
generated in the turbine by the interaction between the rotating blades of the impeller 
and the stationary vanes of the distributor named rotor/stator interaction (RSI). This 
occurs because of the design characteristics of RPT that have low number of blades in 
the runner and operate under high heads. The method used to calculate the main 
excitation frequency that depends on the combination of runner blades and guide 
vanes is explained in the paper. 

For a deeper analysis of the RSI effects, vibration signatures measured in machines 
of different design (manufacturers) are introduced and commented. It is shown that the 
vibration signatures of RPT are different from conventional hydraulic turbines and that 
the vibration levels are very dependent of the operating conditions. Vibration levels are 
at maximum when the machine is operating in turbine mode at maximum load; at 
minimum load vibrations levels can decrease to the half. 

The procedure for the selection of the spectral bands used in RPT monitoring is 
indicated. The band upper frequency and the band lower frequency are indicated 
depending on the rotating speed and on the number of runner blades and guide vanes. 

Some of the most typical types of damage found in these machines during these years 
of monitoring have been represented. Damage in generator, in radial and thrust 
bearings, cavitation, damage in structure and unbalance are introduced. The symptoms 
and the changes in the spectral band levels for all these types of damage are included. 

Fatigue damage in the runners of these machines is not uncommon due to several 
reasons. The strong pressure pulsations of RSI are generated where the runner has 



9 
 

the maximum deformations with possible excitation of its natural frequencies. The 
runner vibrations can hardly be detected by monitoring vibrations in the bearing 
because natural frequencies of the runner do not produce important deformations in 
the rotor. New monitoring methods have to be used to monitor the runners of these 
machines.
