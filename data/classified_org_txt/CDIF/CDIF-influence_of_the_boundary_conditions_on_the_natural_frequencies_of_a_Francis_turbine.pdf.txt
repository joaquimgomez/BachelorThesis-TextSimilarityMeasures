Abstract. Natural frequencies estimation of Francis turbines is of paramount importance in the 

stage of design in order to avoid vibration and resonance problems especially during transient 

events. Francis turbine runners are submerged in water and confined with small axial and radial 

gaps which considerably decrease their natural frequencies in comparison to the same structure 

in the air. Acoustic-structural FSI simulations have been used to evaluate the influence of these 

gaps. This model considers an entire prototype of a Francis turbine, including generator, shaft, 

runner and surrounding water. The radial gap between the runner and the static parts has been 

changed from the real configuration (about 0.04% the runner diameter) to 1% of the runner 

diameter to evaluate its influence on the machine natural frequencies. Mode-shapes and natural 

frequencies of the whole machine are discussed for all the boundary conditions tested. 

1.  Introduction 

In order to satisfy the new market requirements for more dynamic and flexible energy generation, 

Francis turbines are demanded to increase their power concentration as well as their regulation capacity. 

This fact leads to increase heads and fluid velocities and to widen the operation range of units. 

Consequently, excitation forces are higher and severe vibration problems may appear [1-3]. 

The vibratory response of hydraulic turbines during operation depends greatly on the dynamic 

properties of the runner and the boundary conditions such as the confinement or hydraulic seals. Francis 

turbine runners are rotating structures submerged in water and confined with small axial and radial gaps 

to the stationary parts. The size of these gaps affects considerably the dynamic response of the runner, 

which is normally characterized by the runner’s natural frequencies and damping ratios associated to 

each mode-shape. The smaller is the gap between a submerged structure and a nearby wall, the lower 

the value of its natural frequencies is. This phenomenon is well-known in the field and it is explained 

by the added mass theory [4-6]. However, the damping ratio associated to each natural frequency and 

mode-shape tend to be higher when the gap is smaller as it was demonstrated also by Valentín et al. [6]. 

Natural frequencies of Francis turbine’s runners are commonly estimated through of numerical 

simulations [7]. Finite Element Method (FEM) models, together with acoustical formulation to consider 

the surrounding water, are capable to predict with precision the natural frequencies of submerged 

structures, even when they are near a rigid boundary [4, 5, 8]. However, this kind of simulation does not 

consider complex terms such as damping; therefore added damping due to the surrounding water is not 

taken into account. This fact could lead to overestimate amplitudes of vibration and to neglect 

hydrodynamic dissipative effects.

Moreover, in these simulation models is not possible to include all the components of the machine 

such as bearings or labyrinth seals because of their complexity. Therefore some simplifications are 

usually made, introducing some uncertainties in the results. The influence of water and nearby rigid 

surfaces not only is relevant in the runner natural frequencies, but also it may affect to the natural 

frequencies of other components of the hydraulic turbine such as shaft or generator. In this paper, the 

influence of nearby rigid surfaces is studied through numerical simulations for a real prototype of a large 

Francis turbine. The simulation model considers the main components of the machine (generator, shaft, 

runner and surrounding water) to see the influence of changing the gaps’ dimension between the runner 

and the nearby walls on the natural frequencies of the whole machine. 

2.  Characteristics of the turbine 

The turbine of the present study is a medium head Francis turbine located in MICA Power Plant in 

British Columbia, Canada. This turbine has been selected to study it under the European Project 

Hyperbole [9]. The specific speed of the Francis turbine is about ν=0.29 according to Eq. (1) [4], being 

the nominal speed of the machine Ω=13.47 rad/s.  

2.1.  Runner 

The main dimensions of the runner and boundaries can be seen in Fig. 1. The relationship between the 

inlet diameter (Din) and the outer diameter (Dout) is Din/Dout=1.1, a characteristic value of a medium-high 

head Francis turbine. The runner has 16 blades (20 wicket gates in the distributor) and it is made of 

stainless steel. The radial gap between the runner and the static parts (g) in the real configuration of the 

prototype is rather small in comparison with the inlet diameter of the turbine (Din) (g/D=4·10
-4). 

Regarding to the axial gap between the runner’s crown and the upper cover, as it can be seen in Fig. 1, 

it is small in the part of the crown’s tip, but larger for lower diameters of the runner. Between the crown 

and the upper cover, there is a structure whose purpose is to reduce the secondary flow due to the rotation 

reducing friction losses and, at the same time, reducing the added mass and increasing the damping. 

This structure is formed by two annular rings connected by 30 ribs (see Fig. 1). The distance between 

this structure and the runner’s crown is about 0.075% the runner inlet diameter (h/Din=7.5·10
-4). 

Therefore, it is important to estimate the influence of the radial and axial gap distance on the natural 

frequencies of all components of the machine.  

2.2.  Shaft 

The shaft of this machine is also made by stainless steel and its diameter is 0.25 times the runner inlet 

diameter (Din), whereas its length is 1.5 times the runner’s inlet diameter (Din). It is a single piece 

structure with a hollow in the center (Fig. 2). The machine is an umbrella-type machine, supported by 

two radial bearings in the turbine and in the generator sides and one thrust bearing in the generator side. 

2.3.  Generator 

As the rotational speed of the machine is not too high (13.47 rad/s), the generator diameter is quite large 

compared with the runner (2.25 times the runner inlet diameter (Din)). The generator is formed by 52 

poles that are supported by a spider type structure (see Fig. 2).

3.  Simulation model 

To study the influence of radial and axial gaps between the runner and the static part on the natural 

frequencies of all the components of the machine, a structural-acoustical FSI simulation model has been 

built up. Ansys® [10] commercial software has been used to solve the simulation model. This simulation 

model considers the generator, the shaft, the runner and the surrounding water.

3.1.   Mesh 

The mesh of the generator and shaft is formed by 10-node tetrahedral elements (SOLID187 [10], see 

Fig. 3), whereas the mesh of the runner and surrounding water had to be constructed with 8-node 

hexahedral elements (SOLID185 for the runner and FLUID30 for the water) to consider the small gaps 

between the runner and static parts (g and h, see   

Fig. 4). A mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out by increasing the number of elements of each part 

until the difference in natural frequency values between the case of study and the densest mesh tested 

was below 1%. The optimal mesh obtained for the whole machine was formed by approximately 9·105 

elements (7,600 elements for the shaft, 77,800 elements for the generator, 230,000 for the runner and 

584,600 elements for the water).

3.2.  Material properties 

The shaft and the runner are made by stainless steel, therefore the properties for these two parts are the 

typical of this material (ρ=7800 kg/m3, E=200 GPa, ν=0.3). However, the generator is formed by the 

poles and the spider structure, which are made from different materials. For the simulation, just one 

material was considered using the total mass of the generator according to the manufacturer data 

(ρ=3557 kg/m3, E=200 GPa, ν=0.3). The water was considered as an acoustical fluid with ρ=1000 kg/m3, 

and the speed of sound of 1430 m/s. 

3.3.  Boundary conditions 

3.3.1.  Bearings 

The machine’s bearings are modelled in the simulation using two radial springs (with a separation of 

90 degrees between them) in the turbine bearing, other two radial springs at 90 degrees in the generator 

bearing and two axial springs to model the thrust bearing. According to experimental results obtained 

in previous studies [11], the value of these springs stiffness normally ranges between 109 N/m and 1010 

N/m depending on the type of bearings and the machine. For the simulations of the present study, 1010 

N/m was selected as the stiffness of all springs. 

3.3.2.  Water boundary conditions 

The nodes of the water that are in contact with the static parts (upper and lower cover) are fixed without 

any displacement in all directions, whereas the nodes of the water in contact with the runner are defined 

as FSI (Fluid Structure Interaction) interface. The nodes at the inlet and outlet of the runner are 

configured with atmospheric pressure (Fig. 5).

4.  Results 

4.1.  Mode-shapes 

The mode-shapes of this machine can be separated in mode-shapes of each structural part (generator, 

shaft and runner mode-shapes) according to where they have the maximum displacement. Generator and 

runner mode-shapes are cylinder-like structures [12], this means that their mode-shapes are defined with 

nodal diameters (ND) (points which are stationary during the cycle of the mode-shape). However, the 

mode-shapes of the shaft are rather dependent on the bearing stiffness and they are normally classified

by their apparition order in frequency. The mode-shapes within the frequency band 0-100Hz in water 

are shown in Fig. 6.

4.2.  Radial gap influence 

The radial gap (g) was increased from 4·10-4 times the runner inlet diameter (Din) to 10
-2 times. In all 

these simulations the axial gap was maintained as in the real configuration and the ribs structure was not 

considered. The simulation was also run in air (without surrounding water) to see the influence of the 

added mass.

Fig. 7 shows the influence of the radial gap in the natural frequencies of the machine. Natural 

frequencies in water (fw) over natural frequencies in air (fa) are plotted for all the mode-shapes. It is 

observed that the runner’s mode-shapes are the most affected by the surrounding water. A reduction of

between 30-35% in the natural frequency against the air configuration have been obtained. Moreover, it 

is seen that natural frequencies are smaller for smaller radial gaps. With the smallest radial gap tested, 

natural frequencies of the runner present between 35-55% of reduction against the air’s case. The first 

mode-shape of the generator (Generator 1ND) and the mode-shapes of the shaft are also affected by the 

added mass of the water, being the reduction from 5% to 20% against the air’s case. This is because, in 

these mode-shapes, the runner also has deformation (see Fig. 6) and therefore the radial gap is affecting 

it. However, the 2ND mode of the generator, which in fact does not have deformation in the runner, is 

practically unaffected by both water and radial gap. 

4.3.  Ribs structure influence 

To see if this structure has an influence on the natural frequencies of the machine, another simulation 

was carried out but including the ribs structure. For this simulation, the radial gap was selected as 2.4·103 

times the runner inlet diameter (Din) and all other parameters were maintained as in the base case 

configuration. Table 1 shows the natural frequencies of the machine in both cases with and without ribs 

structure. It is seen that the difference for the runner natural frequencies are about 7%, whereas for the 

mode-shapes of the shaft and generator this difference is practically negligible. Therefore, this structure 

is affecting the added mass of the runner but the influence is not too high.

5.  Conclusions 

The natural frequencies and mode-shapes of a large Francis turbine have been determined by means of 

structural-acoustical FSI simulations. The simulation model considered the generator, the shaft, the 

runner and the surrounding water. Different radial gaps between the runner and the static parts have 

been tested. Moreover, the influence of considering the ribs structure between the runner’s crown and 

the upper cover has been studied. 

It has been demonstrated that the radial gap has a big influence in the runner natural frequencies 

(about 40-50% of reduction against the natural frequency in air depending on the mode-shape) and 

lower, but it is still important, in the shaft and generator natural frequencies. Regarding the ribs structure, 

which decreases the distance between the runner’s crown and the upper cover, a small decrease in natural 

frequencies of the runner was appreciated (7% of difference between considering or not this structure). 

Structural-acoustical FSI simulations have been demonstrated to be valid to study the added mass 

effects for different boundary conditions.
