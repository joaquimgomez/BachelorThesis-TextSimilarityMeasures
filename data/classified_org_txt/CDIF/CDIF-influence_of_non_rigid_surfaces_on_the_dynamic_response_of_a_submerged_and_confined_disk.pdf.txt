ABSTRACT  
Determining the dynamic response of submerged and confined disk-like structures is of interest in 

the hydraulic turbines field. Disks present similar dynamic characteristics than hydraulic turbine 
runners, especially in the mode-shapes associated with each natural frequency. The dynamic response 
of submerged structures is heavily affected by the added mass and damping as well as the proximity of 
solid boundaries. In all studies the solid boundaries are commonly considered completely rigid, 
however in real cases this is not always true. This fact occurs in some hydraulic turbines where the 
casing is not completely stiff and it may have some dynamic response in the frequency range of the 
runner, which may affect its dynamic behavior. 

To determine the influence of the casing stiffness on a vibrating disk submerged in water an 
experimental investigation has been carried out. A test rig consisting of a disk attached to a shaft 
inside a cylindrical tank closed with two different covers with different stiffness has been built up. The 
disk was impacted using a hammer and both disk and covers responses were measured with different 
accelerometers. Pressure sensors mounted on the covers have also been used. Natural frequencies of 
the disk have been obtained, compared and discussed for different disk to cover distances.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Disks have been used in previous investigations to study the dynamic behavior of 

submerged structures. When a structure is submerged in a heavy fluid, such as water, its 
dynamic behavior drastically change in comparison with that in vacuum or in air. This 
dynamic behavior is commonly studied by analyzing the natural frequencies and damping 
ratio of each associated mode of vibration. Current analytical studies of natural frequencies 
and damping ratio of submerged structures are based on the added mass [1-3] and damping 
effect [4, 5].  The effect on natural frequencies of a submerged structure is the same as 
considering and additional mass. Therefore, the natural frequencies of submerged structures 
are lower than the natural frequencies of the same structure in air or in vacuum. The added 
mass theory also explains that the natural frequencies of submerged structures close to a rigid 
surface tend to decrease when the distance to this rigid surface also decreases [5-8]. 
Moreover, it is demonstrated that an added damping appears when the structure is submerged 
in water and this is even more important when nearby rigid surfaces are considered [4, 9, 10].  

However, the case of a submerged structure that is close to another vibrating structure is 
not studied. Actually, only some studies with two identical disks coupled by a fluid are found 
[11-13], but in these papers the authors assume that both disks vibrate at the same natural 
frequency with the same mode-shape. This is not completely realistic in the case of hydraulic 
turbines, where the runner is a disk-like structure submerged in water and confined with other 
nearby structures, such as the head cover or the lower cover (see Fig. 1).

Head covers of hydraulic turbines are structures that can vibrate at the same time than the 

runner if they are not very stiff. This fact could alter the expected dynamic behaviour of the 
whole machine and especially of the runner. In these machines, the axial and radial gaps of 
the runner and the covers are rather small, less than 3 or 4 millimetres in most of the cases. 
These boundaries are usually modelled as rigid surfaces in the numerical models used for the 
natural frequencies estimation as Jacquet-Richardet and Dal-Ferro [14], Lais, Liang, 
Henggeler, Weiss, Escaler and Egusquiza [15] and H√ºbner, Seidel and Roth [16] confirmed in 
their studies, hence the vibration of nearby structures is usually neglected. 

To evaluate the influence of non-completely nearby rigid surfaces on a submerged 
structure, a test rig has been built up. This test rig consists of a stainless steel disk attached to 
a shaft and confined inside an aluminium tank closed with two different covers. These covers 
have different thickness and so different mass and stiffness, resulting in different natural 
frequencies. Disk natural frequencies and damping ratios have been estimated experimentally

for different distances to both covers. Accelerometers and pressure sensors installed on the 
disk and casings have been used. Moreover, structural-acoustical numerical simulations are 
performed and compared with experimental results.  

 
2. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION 
2.1 Test rig description 
 

The test rig used in the present work comprises a stainless steel disk coupled to a shaft and 
confined with water in an aluminum tank (see Fig. 2). This aluminum tank is closed using two 
different covers, one thin with natural frequencies in the same range than the disk, and the 
other cover used is thick with natural frequencies separated with those ones of the disk.  Both 
covers are made of the same aluminum than the tank. The tank has a large thickness and mass 
to simulate rigid surfaces around the disk. The disk can be moved up and down along the 
shaft in order to evaluate the influence of the nearby rigid bottom surface (H2) and the 
influence of the distance between disk and cover (H1). Between the disk and the tank there is 
a small radial gap (G) (0.35¬±0.05 mm). The radial gap is selected as 0.35 in order to represent 
the same order of magnitude that there is in a hydraulic turbine runner against its radius

2.2 Instrumentation 
 
The natural frequencies and mode-shapes of the disk and cover were determined making 

use of experimental modal analysis (EMA). The force over the structure was applied using an 
instrumented hammer (Kistler 9722, 2.25 mV/N). For the natural frequencies estimation of 
the cover, impacts were applied directly over the cover surface, however, to calculate the 
natural frequencies of the disk, this was impacted using an impact device based on a bar 
coupled to a spring (see Fig. 2). The response of both structures due to the impact excitation 
was measured using submersible accelerometers (Dytran 3006A, 100 mV/g). Two of these 
accelerometers were installed on the disk separated 90 degrees and another two in the same 
position but in the cover. Moreover, two pressure sensors (Kistler RAG50A20BC) were 
installed on the cover to measure the pressure variations due to the disk vibration. Signals of 
hammer, accelerometers and pressure sensors were computed and monitored using an 
acquisition system (Br√ºel & Kjaer Type 3036-B-120). 
 
2.3 Procedure 
 



IAHR WG Meeting on Cavitation and Dynamic Problems in Hydraulic Machinery and Systems, Ljubljana 2015 

As a first stage, natural frequencies of the disk and cover were estimated in the air. The 
frequency response function (FRF), which is the ratio between the vibration and the force that 
produces that vibration, was computed to perform EMA. The average of 5 different impacts 
was selected to perform the FRF of each accelerometer. FRFs were computed using the 
commercial software PULSE Reflex¬Æ [17] from Br√ºel & Kjaer. A frequency range of 0-3200 
Hz and a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz was selected to calculate FRFs.  

The procedure when the disk was in water was practically the same than in air. In this case, 
two pressure sensors separated 90 degress were also available also during these impacts. This 
procedure was repeated for different positions of the disk along the shaft and for the two 
different covers. Moreover, both covers were impacted also for each configuration tested to 
evaluate their dynamic response.  
 

 
3. RESULTS 
3.1 Mode-shapes 
 

The mode-shapes of a disk are defined with its number of number of nodal diameters (n) 
and nodal circles (m) [18]. Fig. 3 shows the natural frequencies and mode-shapes found 
within the frequency band studied in air and in water for the configuration where the added 
mass effect has less influence (H1=47 mm and H2=60 mm). This is the configuration where 
natural frequencies are more similar for both covers. It is appreciated that natural frequencies 
decrease in water in comparison with those in the vacuum, while damping is higher in the 
case of water. 
 

 
Fig. 3. Disk mode-shapes. 

The mode-shapes of the cover are rather similar to those of the disk, having the difference 
that the cover is a circular plate clamped in its exterior diameter, therefore mode-shapes are 
more focused on the center of the structure [18]. As the cover had many instruments installed 
over its surface (accelerometers, pressure sensors, impact device, water inlet and waterproof 
gland connectors for the wires), its mode-shapes were not completely symmetric because the 
mass of the cover was not symmetrically distributed. This fact implied the response of the 
cover to be complicated as is shown in Fig. 4. The more important thing in the cover mode-
shapes estimation is that, as seen in Fig. 4, the thick cover did not have a high response in the 
same frequency band than the disk but the thin cover has some natural frequencies in this 
zone.

3.2 Natural frequencies 
 

Natural frequencies associated with the mode-shapes commented above were estimated 
experimentally for different configurations of H1 and H2 and for the thick and thin covers. 
Fig. 5 shows the experimental results obtained for both covers. Distances have been 
normalized using the disk thickness (hD). It is observed that the trend of natural frequencies 
when the disk is close to the thick cover is the same than when it is close to the bottom rigid 
surface for modes n=2-5: the closer to the rigid surface, the lower natural frequencies values 
presented the disk (Fig. 5a). This behavior is the same as expected and studied by many 
authors [4, 7, 8, 19]. However, the mode n=6, did not experimentally present the same 
behavior when the disk was near the thick cover. The natural frequency of this mode was in 
the region of 1200-1600 Hz, close to a natural frequency of the thick cover. In this case, the 
thick cover was vibrating near a natural frequency with a high amplitude and therefore it 
could not be considered as a rigid surface.  

For the thin cover case (Fig. 5), which had a high response and natural frequencies in the 
same range than the disk (Fig. 4), results are completely different in comparison with those 
obtained with the thick cover . When the disk was near the thin cover, the trend of disk natural 
frequencies was not to decrease as in the case of the rigid surface, in this case, natural 
frequencies seemed to increase. When the disk was far from the cover and near the bottom 
rigid surface, the natural frequencies were as expected for a rigid surface.

3.3 Pressure sensors 
 

For all the tests performed two pressure sensors were intalled in both covers in order to 
measure the dynamic pressure produced by the impact. With these pressure sensors, disk 
natural frequencies could also be found. Analyzing the amplitude of each natural frequency, a 
clear trend was found for all mode-shapes and different distances to the cover. According the 
the theory [7], higher values of dynamic pressure lead to lower natural frequencies values, 
therefore for a rigid configuration it is known that pressure increase when the distance to the 
rigid distance decrease. This can be seen in Fig. 6a. However, for a non-rigid configuration 
(Fig. 6b), as in the case of the thin cover, it is appreciated that for closer distances to the 
cover, pressure decreases instead of increasing, following the behaviour of natural 
frequencies. In Fig. 6 pressure is normalized against the maximum value in all distances 
configurations of each cover.

4. CONCLUSION 
The influence of non-totally rigid surfaces on the dynamic response of a submerged and 

confined disk has been studied. This study is especially of interest when the distance between 
the disk and the casing is small like in some hydraulic machinery runners. 

An experimental investigation in a test rig with a disk confined using two different covers 
with different stiffness has been carried out. Accelerometers mounted on the disk and on the 
cover as well as pressure sensors have been used. Natural frequencies have been calculated 
using EMA. 

Experimental results show that disk natural frequencies are affected by the cover stiffness. 
When the natural frequencies of the casing are much higher than the ones of the disk, the 
behavior is like a completely rigid boundary. However, when the natural frequencies of 
casing and disk are in the same frequency range, they are affected especially when the 
distance between disk and cover is small. For the rigid case, natural frequencies decrease 
when the disk is near the cover, whereas for the non-rigid case the behavior is the opposite.
