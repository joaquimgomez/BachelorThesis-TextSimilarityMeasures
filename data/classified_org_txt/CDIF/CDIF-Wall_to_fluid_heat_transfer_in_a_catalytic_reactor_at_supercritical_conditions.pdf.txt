Abstract 

 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies can be used for improving the understanding of fluid flow 

and heat transfer in packed bed systems. The objective of this work was to study the heat effects in packed 

bed reactor under supercritical conditions using CFD comparing the simulations with empirical 

correlations. Simulations were done for a geometrical model of packed bed of cylindrical catalysts at high 

pressure supercritical conditions. The packed bed tube was heat on the walls and fluid mixture of carbon 

dioxide (CO2), methanol (CH3OH) and triolein (C57H104O6), is flown into the packed bed at 250 bar. The 

flow field is described by three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the energy and 

species governing equations, which are solved by a finite volume code. The heat transfer coefficient is 

obtained in terms of wall Nusselt number (Nuw) from simulation data and compared against empirical 

models for different flow rates.

1 Introduction 

1.1 Packed bed wall-to-fluid heat transfer 

Packed beds are widely used in chemical industries due to their simplicity in structure and effectiveness in 

terms of providing abundant contact area for surface reaction or for heat or mass transfer area. The study 

of heat transfer rate in packed beds is important not only important for design of heat exchangers but also 

for catalytic reactors. In shell-and-tube heat exchanger type packed bed reactor, heat is added (or removed) 

through the packed tube wall from a surrounding heat exchange fluid. To attain optimal performance, it is 

necessary to have good model for heat transfer.  

A two-dimensional model was developed in which heat transfer in radial direction is superimposed upon 

the heat transfer by convection in the flow direction (Wasch and Froment, 1972). There are several 

mechanisms in radial heat flow, so to limit the complexity, the packing material and the fluid are taken as 

a continuum, neglecting the temperature differences between the fluid and solid phases, through which heat 

transfer is considered to occur by ‘effective conduction’. This ‘conduction’ is characterized by ‘effective 

conductivity’ ker. This conductivity, when calculated at various locations perpendicular to the flow, is found 

to be decreasing strongly near the wall (Coberly and Marshall, 1951). This extra resistance near the wall 

causing the temperature jump, is described by as wall heat transfer coefficient hw, which described the heat 

rate as:  

𝑞𝐴 = ℎ𝑤(𝑇𝑤 − 𝑇𝑖 ) (1) 



A two-dimensional model which has been  a standard model, was presented by of Coberly and Marshall, 

(1951), Hatta and Maeda, (1948) which is described as pseudo-homogeneous model, is a classic heat 

balance equation given by Equation(2), for a cylindrical packed bed operated as a steady-state heat 

exchanger, assuming phase continuum. The steady state temperature profiles can be described by this 

equation solution. The solution of the two dimensional model is used for determining effective radial 

thermal conductivity ke, and wall heat transfer coefficient hw from axial temperature profiles. This model 

is preferred over the heterogeneous model which is more complicated and requires more transport 

parameters.

Experimental data has been expressed in terms of hw and kr (or in terms of dimensionless parameters Nuw 

and kr/kf), obtained from models with temperature profiles from experiments. Considerable amount of 

discrepancy exists with these literature data.  

The wall heat transfer coefficient and effective thermal conductivity are found to be influenced by the 

length of the packed bed. Li and Finlayson, (1976) have compiled experimental data and correlated which 

reduced effect of length. The correlation (for 20≤Re≤800; 3.3<N<20) they presented for cylindrical 

packing is:

Heat exchanger studies in packed beds are commonly carried out in wall-heated cylindrical beds with steam 

jackets (Gunn and Khalid, 1975; Wasch and Froment, 1972). Many difficulties are encountered in 

accurately measuring temperature profiles inside packed beds. Direct intrusive measurement would mean 

obstructing the flow and disturbing the geometry of the bed. This poses as an influential issue especially 

at low Re when temperature profiles very flat, making measurement errors very significant. This questions 

the accuracy of experimental data and their corresponding correlation predictions (Freiwald and Paterson, 

1992). Another way would be to obtain temperatures at the outlet of the bed. A non-disturbing experimental 

methods that could be used to obtain flow patterns in packed beds is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

However, this is restricted to low flow rates, up-to Re=100, and for fluid that can produce suitable signal 

for measurement, like water. Gas flow has not been investigated using MRI. CFD studies can be of 

significant use in estimating the flow profiles (Harris et al., 1996). 

1.2 Use of CFD in packed bed heat transfer simulation  

The use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena is 

becoming a standard approach. It was found to be useful in wide areas of applications including reaction 

engineering (Harris et al., 1996; Ranade, 2002) 

Actual temperatures and velocities in the bed are required for determining the effective heat transfer 

parameters. Logtenberg and Dixon, (1998) studied wall-to-fluid heat transfer to a small number of spherical 

particles of a packed bed. They studied the heat transfer parameters from CFD, experiments and 

correlations for plug flow models and axial axially dispersed plug flow model at different temperatures. 

Particles with no internal voids showed better performance in heat transfer. Guardo et al., (2005) done 

simulations of wall-to-fluid heat transfer in a packed bed 44 randomly-packed spheres studying the 

influence of various turbulence models. With the increasing computational power full bed packed columns 

are used for CFD work. Behnam et al., (2013) used a validated full bed 3D CFD model temperature profiles 

to test the 2D pseudo-continuum model (given by Equation (2)) 

Fixed bed models have been usually developed for high tube-to-particle diameter ration (N) beds, in which 

temperature gradients are less and could be averaged. In the current problem studied, the tube-to-particle 

diameter ratio (N) is 9. Guardo et al., (2006) have performed simulations for heat transfer from particle-

to-fluid which occurs during an endothermic reaction. The simulations were performed for low and 

supercritical high pressure conditions. Only some studies are available for CFD studies for packed beds at 

supercritical conditions are available. The properties of supercritical fluids vary generally between those 



of liquids and gases. This is due to the fact that gaseous phase and liquid phases merge together and become 

indistinguishable at critical point. These properties, especially density, are highly sensitive to small 

changes in temperature and pressure near the critical point. (Baiker, 1999)   

2 Simulation Strategy 

In modelling fixed beds, there has to be good qualitative understanding and accurate quantitative 

description of fluid flow and heat transfer. The platform used to construct the geometry has to be one which 

allows for the feasibility of generating good mesh and able to capture all the phenomena of the problem.    

The packed bed is based on the geometry of a packed bed catalytic reactor which is of length 152mm and 

diameter 17.5mm. This reactor is filled with cylindrical particles of diameter 1mm and length of 5mm, 

resulting in tube-to-equivalent spherical particle diameter ratio of 9. A wall-segment (WS) model geometry 

is used, which takes less computational effort. WS model is a 120º segment of the packed bed as opposed 

to a complete wall (CW) full bed model. The WS model geometry was found to have overall axial velocities 

and temperatures only slightly different as compared to a full bed (CW) model (Taskin et al., 2007).  By 

taking the cut parts as symmetrical, one third of the tube is run for simulations decreasing the computational 

effort. The arrangement of the cylindrical particles is random. The particles are arranged at random with 

angle of cylindrical particle axis varying from 0º to 90º to the axis of the tube. Arranging particle at random 

to avoid bad flow distribution and channelling. Each particle is arranged by sequential operations in the 

software for moving the particle around in the tube. The cylindrical particles are arranged such that their 

axis is at angle 0º, 15º, 30º, 45º, 60º, 75º, 90º with the axis of the tube. The overall voidage of the bed is 

about 0.6. Because of slight overlapping (about 1 to 2% of the volume) the bed void is not exactly the 

volume deducted due to the particles volume. The whole bed consists of 3780 cylindrical particles. The 

tube has extensions before and after the bed of cylinders, in order to minimize the end effects, and the back 

flow temperature condition at the outlet.   

In the geometries previously reported (called near-miss model) by Dixon group, the particles have small 

gaps (and assumed zero velocity) between each other to avoid convergence problems, (Nijemeisland and 

Dixon, 2001). But Guardo et al., (2006) has the particles overlap about 1% at the contact points and found 

no convergence problem. For the model used current work, particle-to-particle contact areas were 

overlapped about 1 to 2% of the particle volume with adjacent particles. Some particles were chipped near 

the wall of the tube, and within the segment sides. This helps in treating the whole particles as a single 

volume so having ease of mobility of particles and avoiding meshing errors causing convergence problems. 

The particles are however avoided contact with the tube wall by having a very small gap at the wall contact 

points. This was done to avoid errors during meshing.  No convergence problems were detected during 

simulation runs. The Finite volumes mesh is based on 3D tetrahedral elements. The wall surfaces are 

meshed using an unstructured triangular mesh and this surface mesh is used to construct the volume mesh. 

And the particles surfaces are refined by unstructured quadrilateral mesh. The mesh is checked for 

independence with various levels of refinement by checking velocity for flow of water through the packed 

bed geometry. And optimum mesh refinement is selected for the heat transfer study. 

The fluid, mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2), methanol (CH3OH) and triolein (C57H104O6), (reactants for 

transesterification reaction with supercritical solvent CO2) is flown into the packed bed at 250 bar pressure 

and 473.15K temperature, is taken to be Newtonian, in laminar flow. Pure component properties are taken 

at this pressure as a function of temperature. Density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat of 

the fluid components are estimated as a function of temperature. Dilute approximation mass diffusivity 

coefficients are estimated for methanol-carbon dioxide and triolein-carbon dioxide. Methanol and triolein 

are taken to be dilute species for the diffusivity estimations. The tube wall is maintained at temperature 

483.15K. The mixture properties are based volume weighted for density and specific heat, and mass 

weighted average for thermal conductivity and viscosity. The components form a single phase by the 

presence of supercritical CO2. 

Fluid flow is basically described by mathematical models (governing equations) which are based on 

physical principles of conservation of mass, and conservation of momentum. These are accurately 

described by three dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations. These models coupled with energy and 

species models are solved in by various CFD codes.  The standard numerical solution methods for these 

models are finite differences (FD), finite volumes (FV), finite elements methods (FE) (continuum flow 



methods).  A Finite volume (FV) code is employed for this study.  For all types of flow, the FV code solves 

the mass and momentum conservation equations. Energy conservation equation is solved for flows 

involving heat transfer. Species conservation equation is solved for flows involving multiple species 

mixing or reactions.

Equation Error! Reference source not found.) gives the temperature profile in the packed bed. The heat 

transfer wall heat transfer coefficient hw, is determined from measurements of axial temperature profiles 

i.e. T = Tc at r = 0 using Equation Error! Reference source not found.). The temperature profiles at any 

radial position will do, but the temperature measurements along the central axis of the bed, where radial 

temperatures level off, are most preferable.  

As mentioned earlier, the fluid mixture enters at temperature 473.15K and the wall is heated at temperature 

473.15K. Figure 1 shows the temperature spread more at lower flow rate (Re=0.37) than at higher flow rate 

(Re=7.82). For the higher Re there is mixing near the wall because of higher kinetic energy. And because 

of more fresh lower temperature fluid molecules, the heat transfer rate is higher. The fluid with flow 

Re=0.37, is nearer to an equilibrium temperature because of more residence time of fluid molecules.

correlations based on experiments 

Velocity fields for Re=7.82 and 0.37 are shown in Figure 1. The length of the pointers indicates the velocity 

magnitude. The velocity vectors are coloured by density. At the entrances of the packed bed it can be seen 

that the vectors are uniform throughout the bed at both the Re. For the low Reynolds numbers, the wall 

effects and particle surface effects are at a minimum. However, at the ending of the bed crossflows can be 

seen. Also there is back flow (negative magnitude, dark blue regions in velocity field.) at some locations in 

the centre of the bed for the second half, this crossflows contribute to a more uniform temperature at the 

bed ending. The wall effects can be seen in this region of the bed, where the flow is more developed. 

Although the higher temperature at lower Re would indicate lower density, the velocity vector plots in 

Figure 1(c,d) show a higher density. This is due to accumulation of higher density methanol at lower Re. It 

can also be seen that at lower Re the temperature and concentration in the bed are not uniform in the radial 

direction in bed.  

For the calculations of Nuw, fluid thermal conductivity kf was kept a constant reference value. Re was 

calculated at the average values of viscosity in the bed and mass flux G=ṁ/S=ρu0. In Figure 2 are shown 

the values for Nuw for different values of Re. The wall heat transfer coefficient was obtained from the 

calculated heat flux and the temperature profiles. The heat transfer coefficient is correlated in terms of 

Nusselt number. The Figure 2 shows increase of heat transfer with Re, this effect can also be seen in the 

temperature contour plots of Figure 1. The empirical models by Hanrattry (1954) correlated for cylinders 

for Re~20 are shown for reference. There is agreement with the correlation at Re~8. However, for lower 

Re, there is much deviation. The other data for reference is the data correlated by  Li and Finlayson, (1976) 

and of Yagi and Wakao, (1959). These correlations predicted lower heat transfer rate. The higher heat 

transfer rate could be because of higher rate of heat transfer in supercritical fluids, which is due to high 

density as shown in Figure 1 (c, d) and low viscosity under these conditions. The data of these correlations 

are modelled for non-supercritical conditions, which also contributes to their variation with the simulations. 

Conclusions 

Heat transfer under supercritical conditions, is studied for packed bed catalytic reactor with constant wall 

heat flux. A packed bed finite element model with tube-to particle diameter N=9, was built. The whole bed 

consists of 3780 cylindrical particles. CFD simulations were done for Re = 0.37 up to 7.82. The temperature 

profiles showed higher temperature for lower Re. Velocity vector fields show higher velocities near the exit 

end of the bed. Higher density at lower Re can be observer, which is due to accumulation of methanol in 

the bed at this Re. Values of Nuw for different Re are calculated from temperature profiles. The results show 

a trend of increase with Re. Higher heat transfer is observed than what is predicted by some empirical 

correlations, which signifies the higher heat transfer for supercritical fluids.
