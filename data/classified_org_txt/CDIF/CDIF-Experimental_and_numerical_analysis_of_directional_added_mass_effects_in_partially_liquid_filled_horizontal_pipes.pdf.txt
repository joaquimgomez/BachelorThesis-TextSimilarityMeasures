The change of pipe natural frequencies due to added mass effects has been investigated in two
cylindrical horizontal pipes from empty to completely water filled cases with various intermedi-
ate partially-filled conditions. The added mass coefficients of the three first vertical and horizon-
tal modes of vibration have been determined with both experimental modal analysis and finite
element analysis (FEA) acoustic-structural numerical simulations, which showed good agreement.
The vertical and horizontal added mass coefficients present different behaviors as a function of
the water level. Moreover, the pipe cross sectional dimensions determine the magnitude of these
effects. For generalization to any pipe size, dependency of the directional added mass coefficients
with new vertical and horizontal added mass estimators has been found. These estimators can be
used in practical situations with horizontally mounted cylindrical pipes as a reference to predict
and quantify air content.

1. Introduction

The interest in horizontal pipeline flow of air-water mixtures started many years ago, as shown by the experimental work of Govier
and Omer (1962) in 1962 who compared various methods to correlate the pressure drop with the air-water ratio. As clearly exposed
by Escarameia (2007), the presence of air in pipe systems can result in problems such as carrying capacity drop, flow disruption and
reduced pump efficiency. Consequently, in large piping systems, considerable costs are incurred to remove the accumulated air due to
dissolved gas or entrapment at pumps or air valves. In pressurized piping systems where optimal air release systems are too expensive
or where the operation requirements do not permit to regularly apply hydraulic removal actions, a method for detection and diagno-
sis of gas pockets is of interest to avoid operation failure or undesirable discharge levels. For example, Lubbers and Clemens (2007)
have carried out several experiments to detect gas problems using dynamic system response analysis. Such nondestructive methods
are obviously helpful to overcome potential problems by applying remedial measures in advance before any unexpected catastrophic
failure.

Pipe systems conveying fluid are Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) systems that have been modeled and simulated with different
procedures, such as the ones proposed by Lavooij and Tijsseling (1991) for instance. A broad overview of the literature pertaining to
the dynamic analysis of fluid-filled systems considering FSI are presented by Li et al. (2015).

In the present work, it is intended to investigate the suitability of detecting and quantifying the presence of gas pockets in cir-
cular cylindrical horizontal shells by assuming that their natural frequencies will change relative to the fully liquid-filled condition
due to added mass effects. The presence of an incompressible, inviscid liquid partially filling a clamped-free pipe was theoretically,
numerically and experimentally proved to change its modal properties as a function of liquid level by Chiba et al. (1984a, 1984b,

1985). Amabili and Dalpiaz (1995) and Amabili (1996, 1997a, 1999) from 1995 to 1999 carried out extensive theoretical and ex-
perimental studies to obtain exact solutions for the free vibration problems of circular cylindrical tanks and pipes from partially liq-
uid-filled conditions to completely filled and partially immersed in dense fluids. As a result, the natural frequencies and the mode
shapes were theoretically found as a function of the water level and validated through comparison with results of experimental modal
analyses. A different numerical approach was proposed by Chen and Ding (1999), Mazúch et al. (1996) and Ergin and Temarel (2002),
who used the finite element method (FEM). In particular, the latter authors calculated the FSI effects in terms of generalized added
masses.

In particular, the natural frequencies of two horizontally free mounted pipes with nominal diameters of DN32 and DN50 (ISO)
will be calculated as a function of the water filling level. Experimental modal analyses and numerical simulations results will be com-
pared and validated. Then, frequency ratios and added mass coefficients will be analyzed and discussed for vertical and horizontal
directions. And finally, two mathematical expressions to estimate the added mass effects as a function of water level will be proposed
that can be used in practical situations to predict the presence of large air pockets in pipes.

2. Theoretical approach

Unlike simple structures such as beams, the mathematical approach to study the dynamic behavior of cylindrical shells is far more
complex. Most of the published work by Amabili (1997b) and Amabili et al. (2001) focus on the simply supported case because this
boundary condition applied to both ends of the shell greatly simplifies the computational effort. However, in the present work, the
authors have focused on a free-free condition shell which has received much less attention but could be considered as an ideally iso-
lated basic case.

In particular, Warburton (1965) applied the generalized approach to the free-free condition shell, which was also reproduced
by Blevins (1979). For that, the characteristic equation in matrix form, A, of an empty cylindrical shell is expressed with Eqs. (1)–(4):

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

Where γ⁠J is the equivalent beam frequency parameter, R⁠s is the shell radius, L⁠s is the axial length, e is the wall thickness, E is the
Young's modulus, ν is the Poisson's ratio, ρ is the density, i and j are the number of circumferential waves and longitudinal half-waves,
respectively, and are parameters that depend on the boundary conditions and is the circumferential natural frequency. So,
the natural frequencies can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation which can be expressed with Eq. (5):

(5)

To consider the effect of a fluid on the natural frequencies of a fully filled simply supported cylindrical shell, Amabili et al. (2001)
used the factor expressed in Eq. (6).

(6)

Where is the modified Bessel function of order I and its derivative and ρ⁠f is the fluid density.
Unfortunately, the use of χ in A does not solve the natural frequencies of the free-free fully filled shell. Moreover, partially filled

cases are even more complex to study analytically.

Consequently, the current work intends to propose alternative empirical correlations which could give reasonable approximations
with very low calculation effort. Specifically, the authors will focus on the first three natural frequencies of “beam-like” bending mode
shapes which, mathematically, can be expressed by Eq. (7):

(7)
The theoretical three first natural frequencies of the empty shell can be obtained by inserting Eq. (7) into A, which will be used as

reference values throughout this work.

3. Tested cases

In Fig. 1, a cross section of the horizontal cylindrical pipe partially filled with water is outlined with its main dimensions, which
are the internal radius of the pipe, R, the pipe wall thickness, e, and the central angle and height of the circular segment determined
by the water, θ and h, respectively. In this case, the water free surface is parallel to the horizontal axis of the pipe.

Based on geometry, the area, A⁠w, of the circular segment defined by the water and its height, h, are given by Eqs. (8) and (9),
respectively.

Two steel pipes with nominal diameters of DN32 and DN50 and the same length L of 1 m have been tested, as shown in Fig. 2.
The inner and outer diameters of the two pipes are given in Table 1.

For the tests, the pipes were filled with different volumes of water and two caps were fitted at both ends to avoid any leakage.
The mass of each single cap is 0.216 kg for DN32 and 0.425 kg for DN50. In Table 2, the water volume V⁠w, the corresponding cen

tral angle θ and the height h are listed for each case with the cases of the pipes empty of water and completely full of water in the
first and last rows respectively.

The experimental and numerical modal analysis of the pipes has been focused on the identification of the three first horizontal
and vertical modes of vibration with 1, 2 and 3 axial half-waves named as f⁠1, f⁠2 and f⁠3 respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.

4. Experimental work

This test has been carried out in the Structures Lab at the Civil Engineering Department in the National University of Ireland
(Galway). Elastic ropes (0.01 m diameter) have been used to simulate free-free conditions for both pipes, as shown in Fig. 4 (left).
These ropes were hung from an existing steel beam at 5 m height. This cantilever beam is part of a steel frame used to test heavy
components and considered rigid. Hanging the pipes from such long ropes reduces the fundamental frequency and, hence, the risk of
any undesirable coupling effect. Eq. (10) shows the simple pendulum frequency:

where f⁠0 is the frequency of the pendulum, g is the gravity acceleration and L⁠r the length of the rope.

4.1. Test rig and acquisition system

Five different accelerometers located along the pipe axis Y have been used; four of them measuring in the vertical axis Z and one
of them in the horizontal axis X. Table 3 summarizes the accelerometers’ data. Also an instrumented hammer, model Dytran M5802,
has been used to excite both pipes.

The same approach has been adopted for both pipes: four different locations have been identified and marked on each pipe, two of
them have been excited in Z direction and the other two in X direction, as seen in Fig. 4 (right). Impact points 1Z and 1X are located
at approximately y⁠1=1 m, whereas 2Z and 2X are located at y⁠2=0.31 m.

The accelerometers were connected to a NI PXIe-4492 module within a PXI DAQ system. This 24-bit resolution module has 8
analog inputs simultaneously sampled and can acquire up to 204 kS/s. Both pipes have been hit ten times on each impact location.
4500 samples at 5000 S/s have been acquired for each hit. Frequency response functions (FRF) have been calculated for the different
combinations (Single Input – Multiple Output) based on the averaged signals to obtain the system natural frequencies. In Fig. 5 some
examples of the obtained FRF's are shown.

To obtain these FRF's, force-exponential windows have been applied to stimulus and response signals, respectively. The effective
length of the response used to compute the FRF has been fixed so that its remaining level is 10% of the peak response as shown in
Fig. 6.

Pipes have been filled with water by means of a pipette through one of the holes drilled to install an accelerometer. Once the
desired water volume has been introduced in the pipe, the accelerometer has been reinstalled and the modal analysis performed. In
each partial volume scenario, the peak identification has been performed.

5. Numerical simulation

5.1. Acoustic-Structural FEA

The coupled Acoustic-Structural analysis considers the structural dynamics equation, along with the linearized Navier-Stokes (NS)
equations of flow momentum and continuity to solve the FSI problem. The NS equations are simplified to get the acoustic wave,
shown in Eq. (11) in its discretized form, assuming that the fluid is compressible (density changes due to pressure variations) and that
there is no mean flow (equal to zero).

Consequently, pressure waves are generated in the fluid by the structure displacement and the structure deformation is affected by
the pressure exerted by the fluid. The discretized structural and lossy wave equations are then combined to obtain the unsymmetrical
coupled FSI matrix system, expressed in Eq. (12), so that they can be solved simultaneously.

5.2. Model

The model, created using ANSYS® v. 14.5, comprises a structure domain for the pipe solid body and an acoustic fluid domain
for the inner liquid and gas volumes filling the pipe as shown in Fig. 7. The material properties of the stainless steel, water and air
considered in the calculation are listed in Table 4.

As a result of the caps fitting, the effective length of the pipes is slightly increased. To account for this extra volume and mass,
both FEM models are modified resulting in a total length of 1.03 m and 1.05 m for the DN32 and DN50 pipes, respectively.

A preliminary mesh sensitivity analysis has been carried out for both pipe sizes. Several meshes with total number of elements
from 5000 to 73,000 and from 2000 to 137,000 for DN32 and DN50 pipes, respectively, present a maximum natural frequency de-
viation of about 0.2% for f⁠3 and lower deviations for f⁠2 and f⁠1. The final mesh refinement for both pipes, as shown in Figs. 3 and 8,
guarantees 2 radial divisions in the pipe wall, 250 axial divisions in both the pipe and the fluid, a minimum of 5 radial divisions in
the fluid and an average element size of 0.005 m. For the DN32 pipe the final meshes ranged from 43,000 to 50,000 elements. For
the DN50 pipe the final meshes ranged from 35,000 to 60,000 elements. The mesh cross sections for each case are shown in Fig. 8.

For the acoustic domain, higher order solid elements with 20 nodes exhibiting quadratic pressure behavior were used. This el-
ement has four degrees of freedom per node including the translations in the nodal directions and the pressure. The percentage of
fluid elements in the total domain was around 50%. For the structure domain, higher order solid elements with 20 nodes exhibiting
quadratic displacement behavior were mainly used. Each node has three degrees of freedom corresponding to the translations in the
nodal directions. Only at the front circular body of the plugs 10 node solid elements were used instead, as can be seen on the left of
Fig. 7.

A full modal analysis was performed with the unsymmetric method to extract a maximum of 20 modes in the range from 10 to
2000 Hz.

6. Results

6.1. Natural frequencies

When calculating the natural frequencies, the mass of the caps should be considered. Based on Erturk and Inman (2007) and Shi
et al. (2015), who give general expressions for the frequency parameters depending on the tip mass to beam mass ratio (correcting
the historical one shown in Blevins (1979)), the theoretical natural frequencies for the empty pipes are shown in Table 5.

The natural frequencies obtained from the physical tests and numerical models are presented in Tables 6 and 7 for the DN32 and
DN50 pipes, respectively, together with the percent deviations of the three first modes of vibration for the various filling conditions.
Regarding the experimental results, the figures indicate the mean value of the frequency peaks detected from 10 impact tests among
the various sensors. The standard deviation for all the values never exceeded 10% of the mean value. It should be mentioned that

since both the sensor locations and the expected maximum deflections for all the modes are well known, those sensors close to a node
for a particular mode shape have not been taken into account for the standard deviation calculation.

For the numerical results for pipe DN32, the maximum percent deviation for equivalent values measured in the physical tests is
2%. For pipe DN50, the maximum percent deviation is 8%. The differences between the values from the simulations and physical
tests are explained firstly by the uncertainty of both sets of data. Secondly, the assumed model simplifications in terms of ideal ma-
terial properties, fluid behavior, geometry and boundary conditions are also error sources. As observed in the numerical results, both
horizontal and vertical natural frequencies are equal when the pipes are empty or completely full of water. The experimental results
instead show slightly higher lateral frequencies for those cases; this discrepancy is due to the simplification of the model, assuming
completely cylindrical caps results in a complete symmetrical geometry in both considered axes of vibration.

6.2. Frequency ratios

As observed in Tables 6 and 7, the natural frequencies of the pipe are maximum when empty, f⁠a, and decrease as the water level
increases until the minimum value is found for the fully filled case, f⁠w. The reduction of natural frequencies due to the added mass
effect is mainly a result of the inertia of the surrounding fluid entrained by the accelerating structure.

Zhang et al. (1999) found that the natural frequencies of a water-filled pipe were about 15% lower than those of an air-filled pipe
due to the extra mass of the water according to the frequency ratio given in Eq. (13).

In all the cases, the deviations of the numerical results are lower than Zhang's deviations. The maximum deviations of the numer-
ical results are found for the larger pipe DN50 with values up to 4%. Meanwhile, the Zhang's maximum ones are up to 14% for the
same pipe size. It can also be noted that deviations are larger in horizontal direction than in vertical direction.

These observations point out that the numerical method permits to take into account the influence of the mode shape on the added
mass effect which is not taken into account by Zhang's ratio. Moreover, the numerical method permits to capture the asymmetry ef-
fects of the coupled solid-fluid system when the pipe is partially filled. In this case, the better performance of the numerical approach
is because Zhang's equation was developed for fully filled pipes; although its range of application has been extended here for compar-
ison purposes only.

6.3. Added mass coefficients

The fundamental frequency of a given mode for a lightly damped structure vibrating in air, f⁠a, can be expressed with Eq. (14):

(14)

where k and m are the modal stiffness and the modal mass respectively. Whereas when submerged in water, the dynamic response of
the solid body is altered by the effect of the water added mass, m⁠w, as given by Eq. (15):

(15)

where f⁠w is the natural frequency in water. Consequently, the added mass coefficient, , can be defined based on the
ratio between f⁠a and f⁠w with Eq. (16):

(16)

The added mass coefficients, C⁠M, for both pipes are plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of h/2R. As it can be seen, the added mass
effects increase with the volume of water filling the pipe and the maximum values are different depending on the pipe size. For
DN32, they reach values around 0.25, meanwhile for DN50 they reach values of approximately 0.3. Vertical and horizontal values
for a given height of water separate because they follow different trends. In all partially filled conditions, vertical effects are slightly
higher than the horizontal ones. This behavior is analogous for both pipe sizes. For the fully filled pipe condition, values in both di

rections are close to each other. In general, the largest deviations between numerical and experimental results are observed in lateral
direction as expected when building the simplified model.

7. Added mass estimators

A theoretical added mass estimator, AM, has been defined based on the static forces of the filling water applied to the wetted inner
pipe walls. The vertical and horizontal water forces, F⁠wV and F⁠wH, can be calculated with Eqs. (17) and (18), respectively.

(17)

(18)

Where ρ⁠w is the water density and A⁠wH is the lateral projection of the circular segment. From them, the vertical and the horizontal
added mass estimators, AM⁠V and AM⁠H, can be calculated with Eqs. (19) and (20), respectively, using the mass of the pipe, m.

(19)

(20)

In both expressions a constant, a, that takes into account the pipe geometry and the liquid and solid densities, is found as indicated
in Eq. (21).

(21)

As a result, for any given pipe and liquid, AM⁠V and AM⁠H can be estimated with Eqs. (22) and (23), respectively.

(22)

(23)

If the vertical and horizontal added mass coefficients obtained experimentally, C⁠MV and C⁠MH, are plotted as a function of Eqs. (22)
and (23), respectively, a first degree and a second degree polynomial trends are found independently of the pipe cross section dimen-
sions, as can be observed in Fig. 10. The equations that best fits the current results for both DN32 and DN50 can be expressed as (24)
and (25):

respectively, and corresponding curve fittings indicated in Eqs. (24) and (25) based on the estimators.

The correlation coefficients R⁠2 of both curve fittings are approximately 98% and 97% for vertical and horizontal data respectively.

8. Potential application

From a practical point of view, the added mass estimators are expected to be applicable to any other horizontally mounted cylin-
drical pipe with a different size. Based on them, it would be possible to estimate the expected frequency ratios without the need for
time consuming experiment or simulation. With this information, we propose to predict air content in industrial conditions with the
simple use of an external accelerometer and a frequency analyzer. The method would consist of exciting the pipe with a hammer
and measuring the induced vibrations when the pipe is under nominal operating conditions and completely filled with water. Then,
regular periodic repetitions of the tests would permit to track if the natural frequencies of the pipe are increasing. In that case, the
increasing rate compared with the estimators would serve to decide if a significant amount of air might be responsible of such varia-
tions and if maintenance action on the piping system like purging is required.

It is important to highlight here that the strength of the present approach is the simplification in terms of calculations required to
obtain a valid result. However, it is evident that neglecting all fluid dynamics effects happening within the pipe can only be done un-
der certain circumstances. In fact, the results in Tables 6 and 7 show that the error increases between DN32 and DN50 for the whole
set of frequencies. The relative importance of sloshing and other fluid effects are expected to increase with the diameter. Therefore,
this method would eventually have a range of application based on the diameter of the pipe and which would define the accuracy
level.

9. Conclusions

The three first vertical and horizontal modes of vibration for free horizontal pipes have been experimentally and numerically ob-
tained for various filling ratios ranging from empty to completely water filled cases. The numerical results for two different nominal
diameter pipes show a good level of agreement with maximum deviations of about 8% in natural frequencies. The vertical and hor-
izontal added mass effects present different behaviors as a function of filling ratio. Moreover, the pipe cross section dimensions also
have an influence on the added mass effects. Two new added mass estimators are proposed that permit to infer the vertical and hori-
zontal effects for any filling condition and pipe dimensions. These results can be used for the detection of air content in pipes.
