Abstract. The dynamic response of submerged and confined disk-like structures is of interest 
in the flied of hydraulic machinery, especially in hydraulic turbine runners. This response is 
difficult to be estimated with accuracy due to the strong influence of the boundary conditions. 
Small radial gaps as well as short axial distances to rigid surfaces greatly modify the dynamic 
response because the fact of the added mass and damping effects. Moreover, the effect of the 
shaft coupling is also important for certain mode-shapes of the structure. In the present study, 
the influence of the added mass effect and boundary conditions on the dynamic behavior of a 
submerged disk attached to a shaft is evaluated through experimental tests and structural-
acoustic coupling numerical simulations. For the experimentation, a test rig has been 
developed. It consists of a confined disk attached to a shaft inside a cylindrical container full of 
water. The disk can be fixed at different axial positions along the shaft. Piezoelectric patches 
are used to excite the disk and the response is measured with submersible accelerometers. For 
each configuration tested, the natural frequencies of the disk and the shaft are studied. 
Numerical results have been compared with experimental results. 

1. Introduction 
Along with technology and manufacturing level of hydraulic turbines improvement, there is a trend to 
increase the power concentration of the units. Therefore, the head, fluid velocity and hydraulic forces 
are being considerably increased and, consequently, some severe vibration problems could be induced. 
Moreover, due to power regulation requirements imposed by the global energy production system, 
hydraulic turbines are increasingly working in off-design conditions causing serious vibration 
problems in the machine. If the natural frequencies of the structure are not accurately calculated during 
the stage of design, it is not possible to ensure that, under operation, a certain force could excite a 
natural frequency producing resonance. Important failures in hydraulic turbomachinery where 
resonance played an important role are documented (e.g. Ohashi [1] and Egusquiza et al. [2]). 

When a structure is submerged in a dense fluid its natural frequencies, and consequently its 
dynamic behavior, drastically change in comparison with those in vacuum. Moreover, if the 
submerged structure is close to a rigid surface its dynamic response is also affected. Pump-turbines 
have submerged rotating parts extremely close to rigid static surfaces, such as the upper and lower 
case clearance, the radial gap between the runner and the volute or the labyrinth seals (see Figure 1).

The effect of the hydraulic seals on the dynamic response in a Francis turbine is uncertain as it is 

shown in the numerical and experimental work of Liang et al. [3] and Rodriguez et al. [4]. Hübner et 
al. [5] confirmed the effect of these seals was not considered in the natural frequencies’ calculation 
during the design stage of hydraulic turbine runners because the simulations were carried out assuming 
large distances between the runner submerged in a cylindrical water tank and the stationary parts. 
Moreover, these simulations did not consider the shaft-runner coupling effect, which is rather 
important for certain vibration modes where the structure is deformed both axially and radially. 

Simpler models, such as cantilever plates or disks, have been used since the middle of last century 
in order to easily study the natural frequencies of submerged structures. Current analytical studies of 
natural frequencies for submerged structures are based on the added mass effect. The effect on the 
natural frequencies of a submerged structure is the same as considering an additional mass. Thus, 
according to the added mass theory, a structure submerged in water has lower natural frequencies than 
in vacuum or in the air. The added mass effect also explains that the closer to a rigid surface is the full-
submerged structure, the lower natural frequency values it has. 

The effect of the added mass for disks in an infinite medium of water has been investigated for 
many years. Ginsberg and Chu [6] developed a variational method to derive the mode-shapes of a 
circular plate in contact with a heavy fluid. Amabili and Kwak [7] applied the Rayleigh-Ritz method 
to study the free vibrations of circular plates inside liquids. Gorman and Horacek [8] presented other 
energy-based methods, such as the Laplace method, showing similar results than the Rayleigh-Ritz 
method. However, these investigations only considered submerged structures in an infinite medium of 
water for axial mode-shapes, neither radial mode-shapes nor nearby rigid surfaces were studied. 

The effect of nearby rigid surfaces on the added mass of submerged disks was studied  by Kubota 
and Suzuki [9], Kubota and Ohashi [10] and Askari et al. [11]. Kubota and Suzuki [9] and Kubota and 
Ohashi [10] analytically and experimentally studied the influence of the axial rigid surface of a 
submerged disk, however no radial gap between the disk and a rigid surface was considered. Askari et 
al. [11] studied the influence of the axial nearby rigid surface on the natural frequencies of two 
different submerged disks. They numerically estimated the effects of the radial gap between the disk 
and the nearby rigid surface considering the disk as a thin beam. They concluded that the nearby rigid 
surface had an important influence on the natural frequencies in the axial direction and a small 
contribution in the radial direction. However, all the mode-shapes studied in these works were axial 
mode-shapes because no shaft was considered. 

In the present study, an experimental analysis of a submerged-confined disk is carried out. The disk 
is made of stainless steel and it is submerged in water and coupled to a shaft which is part of an 
aluminum tank. The disk can be moved up and down along the shaft in order to evaluate the influence 
of the shaft coupling position on the natural frequencies value. The radial gap between the disk and the 
tank is very small (0.35 ± 0.05 mm), the same proportion that there is approximately in a hydraulic

turbine against its runner radius. Moreover, structure-acoustic numerical simulations are performed in 
order to validate the experimental method and to prove the capability of the simulation to predict 
natural frequencies of submerged-confined structures. 

 
2. Theoretical background 
The dynamic behavior of a body vibrating in the vacuum can be studied assuming a simplified mass, 
spring and damper system of 1 DOF. The equation of motion that describes the vibration of this 
system is: 

𝑀�̈� + 𝐶�̇� + 𝐾𝑋 = 0 (1) 
 

where M is the mass of the body, C is the structural damping, K is the spring constant and X is the 
displacement of the body from the equilibrium position. If dissipation effects are neglected, the 
damping term disappears, becoming Eq. (1) in: 

𝑀�̈� + 𝐾𝑋 = 0 (2) 
From this equation the natural frequencies can be calculated for each mode shape as: 

𝑓𝑣 =
1

2𝜋
�
𝐾
𝑀

 
(3) 
 

 

However, when a quiescent fluid is considered around the body, a fluid force (Ff) appears over the 
surface of the body, modifying the general motion equation (Eq.(2)) as: 

𝑀�̈� + 𝐾𝑋 = 𝐹𝑓 (4) 
 

The fluid force applied to the body (Ff) is mainly due to the pressure drag and it can be characterized 
by the assumption of considering the fluid as incompressible and Newtonian in the Navier-Stokes 
equations. If nonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are neglected, Ff is defined as: 

𝐹𝑓 = −𝑀𝐴�̈� (5) 
 

The coefficient MA is called the added mass and it is defined as the fluid force applied to the structure 
due to the inertia of the fluid entrained by the moving structure. Evaluating the fluid force (Ff) on the 
dynamic motion of the submerged body, Eq. (4) becomes: 

𝑀�̈� + 𝐾𝑋 = −𝑀𝐴�̈� (6) 
 

which can be rewritten as in Eq. (2) in order to describe the free vibration of the body. 

(𝑀 + 𝑀𝐴)�̈� + 𝐾𝑋 = 0 (7) 
 

As in the case of vacuum, the natural frequencies value of the system for each corresponding mode-
shape can be calculated from Eq.(7) as: 

𝑓𝑓 =
1

2𝜋
�

𝐾
𝑀 + 𝑀𝐴

 (8) 

Comparing Eq. (2) and Eq. (8), the natural frequency value of the body submerged in a fluid is lower 
than in the vacuum due to the added mass (MA). Assuming that the natural frequencies in the vacuum 
are practically the same as in the air, a dimensionless added mass factor (λ) can be introduced. This 
factor is defined as the added mass (MA) over the modal mass (M). In Eq. (9) this dimensionless factor 
is computed from natural frequencies in air and submerged in a fluid.

The previous formulation explains the dynamic behavior of a submerged body in an infinite medium 
of fluid. However, the boundary conditions of the fluid medium also affect the dynamic behavior of 
the structure but it is difficult to find an expression to calculate their influence due to the complex 
formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, combined mode-shapes (mode-shapes which 
have radial and axial displacement at the same time) are not easily described with these dynamics 
equations of 1DOF. Therefore, experimental results are necessary to understand the influence of 
boundary conditions even in simpler models. 
 
3. Experimental investigation 

3.1. Test rig description 
The test rig used in the present work comprises a stainless steel disk coupled to a shaft and confined in 
an aluminum tank (see Figure 2). The disk has a diameter of 250 mm, whereas the diameter of the 
shaft is of 40 mm. The disk thickness is of 8 mm and the height of the shaft is100 mm. The tank has a 
large thickness and a heavy mass in order to not influence on the natural frequencies of the disk. The 
disk can be moved up and down along the shaft to evaluate the influence of the disk position (H). 
There is a small radial gap (G) between the disk and the tank (0.35 ±0.05 mm). The radial gap was 
selected as 0.35 mm in order to represent the same order of magnitude that there is in a hydraulic 
pump-turbine against its runner radius � 𝐺

𝑅𝐷
≈ 10−3�.

3.2. Instrumentation 
The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the disk were determined making use of experimental 
modal analysis (EMA). These natural frequencies were estimated in the air and submerged in water. 
The frequency response function (FRF), which is the ratio between the vibration and the force that 
produces that vibration, was computed to perform EMA. Piezoelectric patches have been used in order 
to excite the disk. The piezoelectric patches (P-876 DuraAct Patch Transducers) are contracted when 
they receive an electric signal. This contraction creates a force over the disk and consequently a small 
displacement of the structure. The electric signals were sent to the piezoelectric patches by means of a 
four channel signal generator (National Instruments 9263, ±10V) and a voltage amplifier (OM 835, 
250V/-100V).  

The dynamic response of the disk was measured using three miniature accelerometers of 2.9 g of 
weight (Brüel & Kjær 4394, 10 mV/g) which are installed on the disk surface with 90 degrees 
separation. Another miniature accelerometer was installed radially on the shaft to detect the radial 
vibration. Measurements of accelerometers were computed and monitored using an acquisition system 
(Brüel & Kjær Type 3053-B-120). Signals obtained were analyzed computing the FRF between the 
patches signal and the response of the accelerometers.

3.3. Procedure 
Natural frequencies of the disk were estimated in the air and in water for different H values. The 
piezoelectric patches could excite the disk at a certain frequency sending a sinusoidal signal or doing a 
frequency sweep in a certain frequency band. To estimate natural frequencies of the disk, the 
frequency sweep method was used. FRFs for each accelerometer were calculated using the signal sent 
to the patch as a reference with 0.25 Hz of resolution. A Hanning window was applied to the signal of 
the accelerometers with an overlap of 95%. The peak-hold method was applied to see the maximum 
amplitude for each peak value. The parameter estimation methods of the PULSE Reflex® software 
[12] were applied to the computed FRFs to find the natural frequencies and the mode-shapes. 

3.4. Mode-shapes studied 
In hydraulic turbines, combined modes (mode-shapes with radial and axial displacement at the same 
time) are of interest because both runner and shaft are involved. Thus, this study is focused on this 
type of combined mode-shapes. The axial mode-shapes of a disk are defined with its number of nodal 
diameters (ND) and nodal circles (NC) [11]. Nodal diameters (ND) and nodal circles (NC) are formed 
by the points which remain stationary in the vibration cycle of a mode-shape. The radial mode-shapes 
of a one-side cylindrical clamped shaft are defined with its number of nodal nodes (nodes without 
displacement in the vibration cycle) [13]. The first combined mode-shape found in this test rig is a 
combination of a 1ND mode of the disk and a Mode 1 of the shaft (see Figure 3). Other axial modes, 
such as 2ND, 3ND or 4ND modes are independent from the shaft since the deformation at the disk 
center is practically zero. Therefore, the combined shaft-disk mode is selected for the study in the 
present work.

4. Numerical simulation 
Structural-acoustic numerical simulations were carried out to estimate the dynamic behavior of the 
submerged disk. The commercial software ANSYS® [14] was used to solve the FEM (Finite Element 
Method) model (see Figure 4). The simulations considered the tank, the shaft and the disk in order to 
calculate with a good accuracy the natural frequencies. The material’s properties (density, elastic 
module and Poisson module) were determined by the software database for a standard aluminum for 
the tank and the shaft (ρ = 2770 kg/m3, E = 70 GPa, ν = 0.33) and a standard stainless steel for the disk 
(ρ = 7800 kg/m3, E = 200 GPa, ν = 0.3). The fluid density was considered as 1000 kg/m3 and the speed 
of sound in water was considered as 1430 m/s. For simulations in the air, the natural frequencies were 
estimated in the vacuum due to the deviation was considered negligible [15]. Structural-acoustical 
numerical simulations assume that the fluid is considered inviscid, irrotational and without mean flow. 

The mesh was built using hexahedral elements (see Figure 4). Fluid and solid elements were of 
grade 2 with 8 points of integration (FLUID30 and SOLID185). The solid nodes in contact with the 
fluid were defined as FSI (Fluid Structure Interaction) Interface. The free surface condition was 
defined by zero pressure in the fluid nodes and sloshing effects were neglected. The stiffness of the

nodes of the disk in contact with the shaft had to be modified in order to simulate the real junction 
between both parts. In the experimental model the disk was coupled to the shaft by means of a single 
screw, which provided a junction stiffness of one thousand times lower than if they would be totally 
fixed. Therefore, the value of this junction stiffness was calibrated with experimental results. To 
determine the size of the numerical model, the number of elements was increased until the absolute 
percentage difference between the natural frequencies calculated with a number of elements in 
comparison to the densest mesh tested (2·105 elements) was below 1% in all the mode-shapes. The 
optimal mesh selected approximately had 1.4·105 elements.

numerical model and applied boundary 
conditions. 

 
5. Results and discussion 

5.1. Results in the air 
To determine the influence of the disk position along the shaft, different tests changing H (4, 10, 20, 
30, 50 and 70 mm) were carried out in the air. Figure 5 shows an example of the natural frequency 
calculation for the studied mode-shape. In this figure, FRFs of each accelerometer are plotted with the 
electric signal of the piezoelectric patch as a reference. It is appreciated that the responses of 
accelerometers at 0 and 90 degrees are in phase among themselves but in countephase with the 
response of the accelerometer at 180 deg. This fact demonstrates that the disk is moving like a 1ND 
mode. Moreover, the accelerometer of the shaft demonstrates that in this natural frequency the shaft 
has an important contribution.

Comparing both experimental and numerical results for each configuration tested, an error less than 
5% is found. Figure 6 shows the influence of the H distance on the natural frequency value for the 
studied mode-shape. The nearest to the tip of the shaft is the disk (highest H value), the lowest natural 
frequency value has the mode-shape. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the disk position along the 
shaft is important for the studied mode-shape even in the air.

shaft (H) on the natural frequency of the studied 
mode-shape. Numerical and experimental results 
in the air. 
 

5.2. Results in water 
When the disk was submerged in water, more disk positions along the shaft (H) were tested (4, 6, 8, 
10, 20, 30, 50 and 70 mm) in order to adequately capture the added mass effect. The water level above 
the disk was fixed always at 30 mm. Figure 7 shows the numerical and experimental results of the 
natural frequency of the studied mode-shape for different H distances. A reduction in the natural 
frequency value is observed when the disk is positioned near the rigid surface at the bottom. This 
phenomenon is due to the added mass effect [9-11]. After a certain distance (H > 30 mm), the natural 
frequency value can be considered approximately constant. Therefore, contrary to the case in the air, 
the natural frequency value increases when H increases. This fact demonstrates that in water the added 
mass effect is more important than the disk position along the shaft (H).

shaft (H) on the natural frequency of the studied 
mode-shape. Numerical and experimental results

Similar results are obtained if the natural frequency values in water for different H distances are 
compared with those ones in the air (see Figure 8a). When the disk is near the rigid surface, the 
decrease in the natural frequency value with respect to the water is about 60%, whereas for the furthest

configuration to the rigid surface, the natural frequency value decreases only 30%. This behaviour is 
also demonstrated with the added mass factor (λ) (see Figure 8b). Experimental and numerical results 
accurately match (less than 6% of error).

values of the disk position along the shaft (H). b) Added mass factor (λ) for different values of the disk 
position along the shaft (H). 

 
As it is demonstrated that numerical simulation accurately agree with experimentation, in order to 
evaluate the influence of the radial gap width (G) on the natural frequency value, different numerical 
simulations changing this parameter were performed. Figure 9a shows the natural frequency in water 
(fw) over the natural frequency in the air (fa) for different radial gap values (G). It is found that, the 
smaller is the radial gap, the lowest natural frequency value has the structure. Moreover, when the 
radial gap is sufficiently large (G > 30 mm), the natural frequency value remains more or less 
constant. The opposite behaviour can be observed with the added mass factor (λ). Therefore, it is 
demonstrated that the added mass effect is more important when the radial gap is small.

6. Conclusions 
The shaft coupling influence on the dynamic response of a submerged and confined disk with a small 
radial gap (0.35 mm) has been studied. This study is of interest in engineering applications such as in 
hydraulic turbine runners, which are attached to a shaft with small radial gaps between the runner and 
the turbine casing. To evaluate this dynamic response, a test rig has been developed. This test rig is 
made of a stainless steel disk (250 mm of diameter) attached to a shaft which is part of an aluminum 
tank. The natural frequency of a combined mode-shape, which has radial and axial deformation, has 
been experimentally measured for different configurations in air and in water. Moreover, the influence 
of the disk position along the shaft (H) is evaluated. Results of the disk submerged in water have been 
compared with the ones obtained in the air. A numerical model using structural-acoustical simulations 
has been built up to validate the experimental results. 

First, the influence of the disk position along the shaft (H) was calculated in the air. Obtained 
results show that the natural frequency value decreases when H increases (disk near the tip of the 
shaft). Therefore, the disk position along the shaft influences the natural frequency of this combined-
mode shape. Numerical and experimental results accurately match with less than 5% of error. 

The same tests were carried out in water in order to evaluate the added mass influence on the disk 
position along the shaft (H). Results show that the natural frequency value in water decreases with 
respect to that in the air for all the configurations. When the disk is close to the rigid surface (small H 
distance values), a reduction of approximately 60% in the natural frequency is observed, whereas for 
large H distance values, the reduction is only about 30%. This behavior is also demonstrated with the 
added mass factor (λ), which leads us to think that the added mass effect is more important than the 
disk position along the shaft. Experimental and numerical results of natural frequencies match with 
accuracy (less than 6% of error). 

To demonstrate the importance of the radial gap, numerical simulations changing the radial gap 
width have been carried out. Results show that there is a 5-10% of difference in the natural frequency 
value between the configuration with the smallest radial gap (0.35 mm) and the configuration with the 
largest one (50 mm). Moreover, it is demonstrated that the added mass effect is rather important for 
small radial gaps. 

In conclusion, the effect of the radial gap and the shaft coupling is significant and should be 
considered to calculate natural frequencies of submerged and confined structures. This calculation can 
be accurately performed making use of structural-acoustic coupling simulations.
