Abstract. To study the dynamic behavior of turbine runners (natural frequencies and mode 
shapes) not only the added mass effect of still water has to be considered. Also the effect of 
rotation may not be neglected in the dynamic response. In the present study, the dynamic 
behavior of a rotating disk submerged in water is studied. For this purpose an experimental test 
rig has been developed. It consists of a rotating disk submerged in water that can be excited 
and its response can be measured from the rotating system by a slip ring system. For the 
excitation an impact device installed on the casing has been used. The response is measured 
with miniature accelerometers screwed on the disk. The influence of rotation on the dynamic 
response has been determined experimentally.  

1.  Introduction 
The dynamic behavior of turbine runners in operation is a difficult topic to be studied experimentally 
since the runner is a complex structure confined and submerged, that during its operating condition 
rotates. The rotation of this part with small gaps between the static guide vanes and the rotating blades 
leads to a complex flow that excites the runner. This excitation is known as Rotor Stator Interaction 
excitation or RSI. RSI may produce some damages on the structure as reported in some cases [1]. 
Therefore it is of paramount importance to determine the effects of the confinement (small gaps to the 
casing) and the effects of the rotation on the natural frequencies of this part of the machine. In order to 
study these effects in a systematic way, simplified models such as rotating and submerged disks are 
necessary.  

Some works have been carried out regarding the dynamic behavior of submerged structures and its 
added mass effect. Kwak in [2] studied the hydroeleastic vibrations of circular plates. Nevertheless, 
the effect of nearby rigid walls was not considered. This problem was studied firstly by Lamb [3]. He 
considered the contact plate-water in one side. Rodriguez [4] and Harrison [5] studied the influence of 
only one nearby rigid wall in the natural frequencies of a rectangular plate. Their results concluded 
that the distance plate-wall has a great influence on the added mass effect; i.e. the natural frequencies 
of the plate are generally reduced when the plate is closer to the rigid wall. The case of confined 
plates, which makes the problem much more complex, has been studied recently by Askari in [6]. He 
provided a complete formulation for the flow above and under the disk. The influence of the radial gap

and the influence of the free surface in the natural frequencies was also determined. Although the 
influence of the surrounding fluid, the nearby rigid walls and the free surface in the hydroelastic 
vibration of plates has been considered in the mentioned cases, no experimental results have been 
found where the effect of the rotation of the surrounding water is considered. 

This effect has to be considered to describe the real operating condition of hydraulic 
turbomachinery. Kubota in [7] investigated this problem. He proposed an analytical model to study the 
effect of rotation in the natural frequencies of a rotating disk in water. He used a simplified model for 
the disk structure and for the flow in the tank. With these assumptions, an analytical expression was 
deduced in that paper to calculate the natural frequencies of the disk. The solution was provided for 
the case that only one surface of the disk is in contact with a high density fluid (water) and all the fluid 
is moving at the same rotating speed with respect to the disk. The influence of the viscosity of the fluid 
was not considered and the case of a confined disk in rotation was not studied. Furthermore, no 
experimental results were given in that study. 

In this paper, the effect of the rotation on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a submerged 
disk is studied experimentally. For this purpose a rotating disk test rig has been made. It consists on a 
disk that can be excited and its dynamic response measured from the rotating system. For the 
excitation an impact device fixed on the casing has been used. To measure the disk vibration miniature 
accelerometers have been attached on the disk. The first several natural frequencies and mode shape of 
the disk have been determined for the disk rotating in water and in air. Results are contrasted with the 
analytical model proposed in [7] 

2.  Analytical model 

2.1.  Natural Frequencies and mode shapes 
The model presented in this paper can be found in [7]. The simplified case of study is shown in figure 
1. 

 

Figure 1: Fluid rotating with respect to the disk 

 
The basic assumptions for this model is that there is a potential flow that rotates uniformly with a 

velocity Ω with respect to the disk. Furthermore it is considered that the differential coefficients of the 
motion of the fluid and the disk in the radial direction are negligibly small [7] and the disk and flow 
motion is studied in the averaged radius 𝑟𝑜 = �𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑡 · 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡. In this case, the equation that has to be 
accomplished for this flow in cylindrical coordinates is:

The boundary conditions that have to be accomplished in this case is that the axial velocity of the 

flow on the rigid wall is equal zero, and on the disk surface is equal to the vibration of the disk, i.e.:

The vibration of the disk, particularized in the averaged radius 𝑟𝑜, for each mode n can be 

expressed as following (equation (4)): 
 

𝑤 = ∑ 𝐴𝑛𝑒𝑗𝑛𝜃𝑒𝑗𝜔𝑛𝑡∞𝑛=±1                                                  (4) 
                                                                                                                 

In this case, only the modes with no nodal circles and n diametrical modes are considered. 𝜔𝑛 are 
the natural frequencies of the disk. The characteristic equation given in [7] for this model is:

𝜌𝐷 ,𝜌𝐹 are the densities of the disk and surrounding fluid respectively. D* is a parameter that has 

units of stiffness and can be calibrated with the natural frequencies of the disk in air (see equation (6)). 
This analytical equation leads us to calculate the natural frequencies for each mode n. The solutions 
obtained in equation (5) have to be substituted in equation (4) in order to determine the mode shapes 
of the disk.  

2.1.1.   Surrounding  fluid air 
When the surrounding fluid is air, since the density  𝜌𝐹 is small, equation (5) can be simplified as: 

  
(𝜌𝐷ℎ𝐷)𝜔𝑛2 + �−

𝐷∗

𝑟04
𝑛4� = 0                                                    (6) 

 
The parameter D* can be calibrated comparing the natural frequencies obtained with equation (6) 

and exact analytical methods presented in some references [8, 9]. 
Equation (6) gives the same solutions 𝜔𝑛  for each pair of n-positive and n-negative. If this pair of 

natural frequencies is substituted in equation (4), the motion of the disk can be rewritten as: 

𝑤 = ∑ 2𝐴𝑛 cos(𝑛𝛳) cos (∞𝑛=+1 𝜔𝑛𝑡)                                     (7) 

 
This motion can be understood as a standing wave (all the points of the disk moving in phase or in 

counterphase) viewed from the disk with 2·n nodal points in the circle. 

2.1.2.  Surrounding  fluid water 
In this case the pair of n-positive and n-negative has two different solutions in equation (5) for 𝜔𝑛.  
The motion of the disk can be expressed as: 
 

𝑤 = ∑ 𝐴𝑛 (∞𝑛=±1 𝜔𝑛𝑡 + 𝑛𝛳)                                               (8) 
 
For each n (positive or negative), there is a different natural frequency. Corresponding to each 

natural frequency, there is a mode shape with frequency in time 𝜔𝑛/2𝜋 that is a travelling wave (all 
the points moving with a different phase to each other). In this case the absolute value of n indicates 
the number of nodal diameters. The sign of n indicates the travelling direction of the travelling wave.

If it is positive, the wave travels in the same direction as the disk and if it is negative it travels in the 
opposite direction. 

 

3.  Experimental tests 

3.1.  Test rig 
 
To study the dynamic behavior of a rotating disk submerged in water, a test rig setup has been 
developed. It consists of a disk connected to a variable speed motor. The disk rotates up to 8 Hz. When 
the disk is rotating, it is excited with an impact device installed on the casing.  

The disk vibration is measured with miniature and submergible accelerometers Dytran 3006-A, that 
are screwed on the disk. The added mass of the sensors and actuators is less than 1% of the mass of the 
disk, so it is checked that after installation of them, the dynamic behavior of the disk doesn’t change. 
Due to the limited number of channels only 4 sensors can be used simultaneously. 

 All the excitation and response signals of the rotating frame are transmitted to the stationary frame 
through a slip ring system Michigan S10. This system is attached at the tip of the shaft.  

The rotating speed of the motor Mavilor MLV-072 is digitally controlled. The rotation of the motor 
is transmitted to the shaft through a cog belt. The vibrations of the motor are isolated from the rest of 
the test rig trough a silent block. A view of the test rig used is shown in figure 2 (without showing the 
transmission motor-shaft). 

 

Figure 2: Overview of the test rig 

3.2.  Accelerometers disk 
 
The disk is made of stainless steel and has a hole on its center in order to attach the shaft. The 
nomenclature used for the accelerometers is A-X, where X is the angle with respect to the 0º direction 
in counterclockwise direction, when the disk is attached to the shaft and viewing the test rig from the 
top. Four accelerometers are screwed on the disk (A-0, A-90, A-180 and A-210).

4.  Results and discussion 
 
In order to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the disk experimentally, the disk is 
impacted in the different situations tested. Here the discussion is centered on the mode n=±2. This 
mode will be studied for the case that the disk is not rotating (Ωdisk=0Hz) and for the disk rotating at 
the maximal rotating speed tested (Ωdisk=8Hz). The aim of this study is to validate the main effects 
explained in the analytical model of section 2, i.e. when the disk is rotating in water. Furthermore, the 
case of the disk in air (rotating and not rotating) will be shown as comparison. 

Figure 4, shows the modes n=±2 for the non rotating case (Ωdisk=0Hz) for the disk in air (figure 4a) 
and for the disk in water (figure 4b). Due to added mass effect of water, the value of the natural 
frequency when the disk is submerged is smaller. Analyzing the amplitudes of both cases, it can be 
seen that A-0, A-90 and A-180 have approximately the same amplitude since it is a mode with two 
nodal diameters (each maximum or minimum occurs every 90º). The accelerometer A-210 shows 
small amplitude, because it is located close to a nodal point.   

Analyzing the phase of both cases it can be seen, that the difference between them is approximately 
0º or 180º. This confirms that the corresponding mode shape is a standing wave, as predicted in the 
analytical model when Ωdisk=0Hz.

the disk in water and Ωdisk=0Hz 
 

 
The same situation but for the disk rotating (Ωdisk=8Hz) is shown in figure 5. When the disk rotates 

in air (figure 5a), the same behavior as the former cases is observed, i.e. all the points moving in phase 
or in counterphase with different amplitude of vibration, depending on their location. Only one peak is 
observed in this case as predicted with the analytical model (equation (6)), when the density of the 
surrounding fluid is negligibly small. 

When the disk rotates in water (figure 5b) the behavior of the disk is totally different. The first 
observation is that two peaks appear instead of one. Analyzing the amplitudes, it can be seen that they 
are approximately the same for all the sensors used. Analyzing the phase shift between sensors, it is 
shown that now the phase between them is not 0º and 180º. This kind of motion (phase or 
counterphase to each other) is only observed between the accelerometers A-0, A-90 and A-180. 
According to equation 8, the phase shift for the modes ±n should be ±nϴ. Therefore, these three 
sensors are moving in phase or in counterphase to each other. But observing the relative phase 
between A-180 and A-210 this is approximately ±60º as predicted with equation (8). All the 
mentioned facts, demonstrate that the mode shapes that appear on the disk for this n, are two travelling 
waves.  

The travelling direction of the waves can be determined with the phase shift of the sensor A-210 
with respect to A-180. In the first peak the sensor A-210 is advanced in phase with respect to A-180. 
Therefore this peak corresponds to a travelling wave travelling counterclockwise if the view of figure 
4 is taken into account. As seen in this figure, this direction corresponds to the rotating direction of the 
disk. For the second peak the travelling direction is the opposite direction, since A-210 is delayed with 
respect to A-180.

4.1.  Discrepancy with the analytical model 
The value of the natural frequency of the disk (rotating and not rotating) in air can be predicted 

with the analytical model proposed by Kubota in [7]. Nevertheless, when the disk is submerged in 
water the values predicted with the analytical model do not match the experimental values. When the 
disk is not rotating, the predicted value with the model is higher as the experimental value. This is 
because the model only considers the disk in contact with water in one side. In this case, the distance 
disk-upper cover is considered as H in the analytical model, since in the tested position the upper fluid 
has the most relevant effect on the added mass, because the disk is closer to the upper wall. The 
comparison between experimental and analytical results for these cases is shown in Table 1. 

 
Table 1. Natural frequency of the mode n=±2. Experimental, analytical and percentage error  

 Experimental Analytical Percentage error 
Air (Ωdisk=0Hz) 257,25 Hz 255 Hz 0,87 % 
Air (Ωdisk=8Hz) 258,75 Hz 255 Hz 1,45% 

Water (Ωdisk=0Hz) 155,25 Hz 175,48 Hz 13,03% 
 
The other source of discrepancy is the rotating speed of the fluid. The difference between the two 

natural frequency of each mode n (fn- - fn+) increases linearly with the rotating speed of the fluid (with 
respect to the disk). Since the model considers that the fluid rotates uniformly with respect to the disk 
(potential flow) with a velocity equal the rotating speed of the disk, the difference (fn- - fn+) is not well 
predicted by the model. In order to determine the rotating speed of the fluid with more accuracy, the 
viscosity has to be taken into account and the real flow field has to be considered. The comparison

between analytical and experimental results for the values fn-, fn+ and fn- - fn+ when the disk is rotating

5.  Concluding remarks and future work 
In this paper a disk that rotates inside a tank full of water has been excited with an impact device 
installed on the casing and the response has been measured with miniature accelerometers attached on 
the disk.  

The previous study of Kubota[7] has been used as the reference for the analytical model of a 
rotating disk with surrounding fluid water. In this paper, the main effects of the surrounding rotating 
water on the natural frequencies that were mentioned in that study have been checked experimentally. 
Nevertheless, some points have to be changed in the model to have a better prediction of the values of 
the natural frequencies. 

As future work, in order to improve the analytical model the whole fluid field has to be considered 
(in case that a totally submerged disk is studied) instead of only one side of the disk. Furthermore, the 
viscosity effects on the velocity flow field have to be taken into account in order to determine the 
rotating speed of the fluid with respect to the disk with accuracy.
