Abstract. Francis turbines operate in many cases out of its best efficiency point, in order to 
regulate their output power according to the instantaneous energy demand of the grid. Therefore, 
it is of paramount importance to analyse and determine the unstable operating points for these 
kind of units. In the framework of the HYPERBOLE project (FP7-ENERGY-2013-1; Project 
number 608532) a large Francis unit was investigated numerically, experimentally in a reduced 
scale model and also experimentally and numerically in the real prototype. This paper shows the 
unstable operating points identified during the experimental tests on the real Francis unit and the 
analysis of the main characteristics of these instabilities. Finally, it is shown that similar 
phenomena have been identified on previous research in the LMH (Laboratory for Hydraulic 
Machines, Lausanne) with the reduced scale model.  

1.  Introduction 
One of the advantages of using large hydraulic turbines for power generation is that they output 

power can be adjusted depending on the instantaneous energy demand of the grid. In order to regulate 
the output power, these units have to operate out of its design conditions. Particularly, many Francis 
units, which are nowadays the most installed hydraulic turbines in power plants, have to work out of its 
best efficiency point for long periods of time. Nevertheless, some operating points can be unstable, 
limiting the effective operating range of the unit. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to 
accurately predict (during the design phase of the unit) and to determine (during the operation of the 
installed unit) these particular points.  

Inside the HYPERBOLE project (FP7-ENERGY-2013-1; Project number 608532) a large Francis 
unit has been investigated by means of numerical models [1, 2] and experimentally on both the reduced 
scale model of this unit [3-6] and the real prototype [7].The real unit has a rated power of 444MW and 
it is located on the British Columbia in Canada. The tests on the reduced scale model (complete model 
with scale 1/16) were performed in the Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines (EPFL) in Switzerland. 

The unstable points of this unit were firstly predicted based on the numerical and experimental 
studies made on the reduced scale model. As a final step of the HYPERBOLE project, a measurement 
campaign on the real unit has been performed. One of the goals of this campaign was to determine and 
to investigate the unstable operating points of the real prototype of the investigated unit. 

In this paper, the experimental data obtained during the prototype tests are analyzed. The main focus 
of the analysis is firstly to determine and to analyze the main unstable operating points of the unit. 
Finally, it is observed that similar phenomena was found in the tests made on the reduced scale model.

2.  Experimental tests 
    The on-site tests in the real prototype planned inside the HYPERBOLE project took place in 
November 2016. The objective was to measure different parameters of the unit such as pressure 
fluctuations, stresses on the runner, vibrations on the bearings and power fluctuations for many operating 
conditions. Schematically, the sensors where installed according to Figure 1. 

 

 
Figure 1. Overview of the installed acquisition system 

As seen in Figure 1, the sensors installed were: strain gauges and pressure sensors on the runner, 
pressure sensors on the draft tube and spiral case& penstock, accelerometers on the bearings and other 
stationary parts and strain gauges on the shaft. Furthermore operating signals such as Power or Wicket 
Gate Opening and Gross Head were also monitored.  

All the signals were simultaneously acquired with a B&K LAN XI module (Pulse module). The 
sampling rate was selected at 4096Hz. All the data were stored in the central computer.  Figure 2a shows 
the active power of the unit and gives an overview of the operating points measured. For the analyses 
presented in this paper, firstly the slow ramp-up (approximately 1 hour) was analyzed. To have such a 
characteristic with the signal of Power, the operating gross head was approximately constant and the 
wicket gates were opened very slowly. The second part analyses the stabilized points, for which the 
operating parameters of the unit were maintained constant for approximately 5 minutes. This permits to 
analyze each particular condition with more details.

3.  Results 

3.1.  Detection of unstable points during the slow ramp-up 
 
   Analysing one of the pressure sensors located on the draft tube (Figure 3) one can identify possible 
unstable points. In Figure 3, the part load instability corresponding to the resonance condition between 
the vortex rope precession and the natural frequency of the unit can be identified for P = 255 MW. In a 
similar way the full load instability has been investigated. The main operating characteristics of these 
points and the coefficients nED, QED are summarized in Table 1. 
    In order to analyse the main characteristics of these two unstable conditions, these are studied with 
more detail during the steady conditions (see Figure 2).

3.2.  Analysis of the unstable points during the steady conditions 
 
    For the operating points shown in Table 1, a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis of the time signals 
has been performed. The steady conditions (see Figure 2) are now considered. For the part load and full 
load instability a signal of approximately 180 seconds is taken for the analysis. The analysis is performed 
with a resolution of 1/16Hz (window of 16 seconds weighted by a Hanning) and by averaging all the 
signals in the frequency domain.  
    For these two unstable points (Figure 4a), a large power fluctuations of the unit are observed. These 
large fluctuations of the output power are not convenient for the grid. The period of oscillation of these 
time signals for these two unstable conditions corresponds to the period detected with the pressure sensor 
at the respective unstable points for the slow ramp up (see Table 1).

Strain gauge on the runner 

    One of the pressure sensor installed on the spiral case, detects an oscillation in pressure of 
approximately 0.5 bar (RMS value) for both unstable points (Figure 4b). The same frequencies are 
clearly detected with an accelerometer installed on the draft tube wall (Figure 4c).  Regarding the strain 
gauge sensor installed on the runner, there is a difference in the autospectrum when comparing the two 
instabilities (Figure 4d). For the full load instability, the frequency detected with this sensor on the 
rotating frame is the same as the frequency detected with the stationary sensors. For the part load 
instability the peak of 1.5 Hz dominates instead of the peak of 0.625Hz. According to the part load [5] 
and full load analyses [6, 8] on the reduced scale model, the first unstable point is excited by a vortex 
rope with a precession motion while for the full load instability, the excitation source is an axial vortex 
rope. This precession produces differences in the frequency content of the pressure field on the rotating 
and stationary frame. The main frequency on the rotating frame can be calculated according to 

, , , where , , ,  are the vortex rope frequency from 
respectively the rotating and stationary frame and   is the rotating speed of the machine. Similar 
phenomena was found in [9]. 
    For the unstable point 1 (Figure 4), the ratio between the vortex frequency and the rotational frequency 

of the runner is , 0,29. Favrel et al. in [4] found approximately the same ratio for the same 

range of Q/Q0. According to [4, 5] (tests in the reduced scale model) this unstable point could be 
explained by a resonance caused by a coincidence of  ,  with one natural frequency of the 
hydraulic system. 
     For the full load unstable point, the study made by Müller et al. in [8] is taken into account. In that 
case, QED was approximately the same as the QED  for the full load instability point identified on the 
prototype and  nED was slightly larger. Same as in the prototype tests, a large pressure fluctuations, due 
to an axial oscillating vortex rope were detected with a pressure sensor installed on the wall of the draft 
tube. The similarity in the shape of the pressure signal can be clearly seen in Figure 5.

4.  Conclusions 
The data obtained after the prototype tests of the HYPERBOLE project, has been analysed. The 

analyses were focused on the detection and the study of two unstable operating points found during the 
tests. For the tests, the operating head of the unit was approximately constant and the wicket gates were 
moved from its minimum opening to almost its maximum. 

These unstable points have been confirmed analysing many types of sensors located on the stationary 
frame and on the rotating frame (runner). Furthermore, the results obtained in the prototype tests seems 
to be in good qualitative agreement with the ones from the reduced scale model test.
