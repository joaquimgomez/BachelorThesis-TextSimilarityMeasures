Abstract: 

The first three mode shapes of a cantilevered NACA0009 hydrofoil were 
experimentally investigated in air and under different flow conditions in a 
cavitation tunnel. First and second bending modes and first torsion mode 
were determined in resonance conditions with the hydrofoil vibrating in air, 
in still water, in flowing water or with leading edge sheet cavitation. The 
hydrofoil was excited with embedded piezo electric ceramic (PZT) patches, 
and the response was measured along the surface at selected positions by 
means of a Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The modes of vibration obtained 
from a cross correlation analysis of the signals were compared for the 
different conditions, and the most significant differences were identified. In 
particular, it was found that the mode shape deformation and the location 
of the nodal lines are dependent on the fluid conditions.

1 Introduction 

The study of the response and dynamic properties of structures submerged in dense fluids has been a 

recurring topic of research for many years (Blake 1972, Blake and Maga 1973 and Blake and Maga 

1975). One of the main gaps when added mass effects are determined by comparison of a body’s natural 

frequencies in different fluids (e.g., air-water) is related to the hypothesis that the mode shapes do not 

differ significantly. In this way, it is assumed that a “wet” mode shape has only shifted its frequency with 

respect to the equivalent “dry” one. The mode of vibration itself is considered to stay unaltered. Despite 

few experimental examples, e.g., Lindholm et al. (1965) and Sader (1998) wherein different nodal lines 

(NLs) of cantilever rectangular beams moved slightly, the mode shapes of “wet” complex structures are 

still accepted to be the same as the “dry” ones (Blake and Maga 1973, Rodriguez et al. 2006,). This 

assumption is important because it is known that even a small change in the mode of vibration can 

produce an important effect in terms of added mass and natural frequency shift as concluded in De La 

Torre et al. (2013). In this work, the authors stated that the frequency shift in submerged bodies is linearly 

dependent on the mass of fluid entrained by the body’s deflection. Moreover, if we also have cavitating 

flows, where significant density variations can occur within the fluid domain, the importance of these 

mode shape variations may be even greater. Additionally, in structural systems with small relative gaps, 

such as Kaplan turbine blades, the influence of the gap on the added mass as indicated by De La Torre et 

al. (2014) could be enhanced by variations in the mode shape that affect the gap’s dimensions. 

All the literature found about this topic –which is very little- refers to the case of submerged structures in 

still fluid (Kwak and Yang, 2013). There is no published evidence for the case of flow conditions and 

even less for the case of a body submerged in a two-phase flow. Only very recently, Rajaomazava III et 

al. (2013) have analytically studied the structure dynamics in inhomogeneous flows, but unfortunately no 

experimental data has been provided. Under these conditions, the behavior of the mode shapes should 

also be considered because common hydraulic systems, e.g., hydro pumps, turbines, and offshore 

structures, are frequently subjected to them. 

Therefore, the objective of this work is to experimentally determine and visualize several mode shapes of 

a NACA0009 hydrofoil under different fluid-structure conditions. Then, they will be analyzed and 

compared by visualizing the body’s displacement among the tested conditions to verify their level of 

similarity or to quantify their differences. A cantilever NACA0009 hydrofoil, which is typically used in

many hydro applications, has been selected because its dynamic behavior is well known by the authors 

thanks to previous investigations. 

2 Methodology 

2.1 Experimental Set-up 

The whole series of tests was carried out at the High Speed Cavitation Tunnel of the École Polytechnique 

Fédérale of Lausanne. The characteristics and details of the cavitation tunnel were described by Avellan 

et al. (1987). An aluminum NACA0009 hydrofoil was chosen with a truncated trailing edge (TE) and a 

subsequent 45° cut as shown in Figure 1 (right). The dimensions of the profile are a 100 mm chord and a 

150 mm span. The material has a theoretical density of 2700 kg/m3, a Young’s modulus of 69 GPa and a 

Poisson’s ratio of 0.3. The hydrofoil was clamped to a subjection system and installed within the 

cavitation tunnel test section as shown in left of Figure 1 and Figure 3 resulting in a cantilever 

configuration. 

 

Figure 1- NACA0009 in a cantilever configuration with its subjection system (left) and cross section from 

leading edge, LE, to trailing edge, TE, (right). 

To excite the structure, two PZT patches were embedded on the hydrofoil surface as shown in Figure 1 

(left) to keep the hydraulic profile and to avoid affecting the flow around the profile. For that, the 

NACA0009 hydrofoil surface had to be mechanized. Each patch has a length of 61 mm, a width of 35 

mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm. Thanks to the small thickness, no significant effect is expected on the 

dynamic response of the hydrofoil.

A Laser-Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) was used to measure the hydrofoil response with the test setup 

configuration represented in Figure 2 (left). The LDV can measure the velocity of the surface 

displacement (mm/s) at a given position through the upper transparent window of the cavitation tunnel 

made of plexiglass. 

2.2 Testing conditions 

Four different conditions were tested with the same foil and the same PZT patches:  

• Tunnel empty of water (Air)  

• Tunnel full of still water (Still Water)  

• Tunnel with flowing water (Flowing Water) 

• Tunnel with flowing water and leading edge, LE, cavitation (Cavitating) 

The flow velocity was fixed at approximately 11.8 m/s because it was found to be the minimum velocity 

necessary to obtain a controllable and stable cavity of approximately 50% of the chord similar to the one 

shown in Figure 2. The incidence angle was 0° through all the conditions. The sigma value was changed 

to retain the flow velocity and obtain the leading edge cavity.

the one used for the current tests under cavitation conditions (flow from right to left). 

It has to be mentioned that for the cavitating condition, to avoid the typical interference that bubbles and 

macrocavities produce on the laser beam, the cavity was attached to the lower side of the hydrofoil while 

the LDV was measuring on the upper surface as represented on Figure 3 (left). In addition, to be able to 

produce a cavity sheet at zero incidence angle, the presence of a strip of roughness at the hydrofoil’s LE

was required. The strip consisted of a 2 mm band of sand glued next to the stagnation point with a 

thickness of approximately 200 µm. 

2.3 Procedure 

The test procedure was analogous for each operating condition. The first step was to identify the first 

three natural frequencies of the hydrofoil which correspond to the first bending mode (f1), first torsion 

mode (f2) and second bending mode (f3) by means of modal analysis. With the PZT patches, different 

chirp signals were generated to sweep wide frequency bands. The observation of the measured hydrofoil 

response allowed to identify each natural frequency when amplified by the effect of the resonance. 

During the natural frequency identification, one of the patches worked as an exciter and the other as a 

sensor. The interested reader can find a more detailed experimental procedure in De La Torre et al. 

(2013). 

Once the natural frequencies were obtained, the profile was excited at each particular frequency and the 

response of the hydrofoil was recorded for each of the 26 different measurement points along the upper 

surface as shown in Figure 3 (right). These points were distributed in spanwise and chordwise directions 

along the hydrofoil surface visually accessible. The distance between points is approximately 0.025 and 

0.02 m in spanwise and chordwise directions, respectively, except for the last column of points (1, 7, 11, 

17 and 21) which is located at only 0.018 m from the previous one. Moreover, the first column of points 

(6, 16 and 26) is located approximately 0.02 m from the clamped foil tip. These positions were marked by 

means of reflective tape because it improves the intensity of the reflected laser beam.

Figure 3. Test setup configuration with the hydrofoil located within the tunnel test section (left) and 

measurement points on the surface of the foil with grey zones indicating the non-visually accessible 

parts (right). 

The tests were repeated for each mode of vibration and flow condition. The LDV was adjusted 

sequentially to the all the points and, for each of them, the foil response to a 60 seconds sine signal was 

recorded. Depending on the noise level of the measured response, only the patch at the LE was used as 

the exciter or both patches were used. Each mode shape was characterized by calculation of the vibration 

amplification factors (gains) under resonance conditions. The amplitude gain for each position was 

obtained by means of a Cross Power Spectrum between the excitation signal and the LDV response 

signal. The phase was calculated with respect to the patch but a reference accelerometer located outside 

the test section on the subjection system was used for verification in case of doubts. 

The acquired data were post processed by means of ME’ScopeVES® in the time and frequency domains. 

As a result, the relative amplitude of each point vibration and the phase shift relative to a reference signal 

were computed. This software allowed us to display spatially defined data such as mode shapes. 

Therefore, we were able to animate and observe the actual motion of the structure under study. For mode 

shape visualization, the actual shape of the profile was simplified to a 0.15 x 0.1 m cantilevered plate with 

35 positions (see Figures 4 to 6) including the exact position of the 26 measured points shown in Figure 3 

(right). Because the software permitted the movement of non-measured points of the structure to be 

interpolated, the approximate total plate motion was obtained. It is important to mention that the point 

numbering does not correspond to the acquisition points represented in Figure 3 (right), it is only an 

internal reference system for the software to represent the geometry.

2.4 Accuracy 

Regarding the accuracy of the measurements, the authors clearly distinguish the following error sources: 

1. Inherent error of the measuring devices. 

2. Non-stationary hydrodynamic conditions under cavitating flow. 

3. Location of the LDV. 

4. Data treatment and analysis procedure. 

The first three sources have been minimized by careful use of the instrumentation and test rig. In addition, 

the hydrodynamic instabilities in the cavity sheet were greatly reduced by producing the 45° TE cut. 

Despite the difficulty of providing a % error uncertainty for the fourth source, based on previous works 

with much more complex data analysis procedures (De La Torre et al. 2013), the % error uncertainty for 

this particular case should be below 2%. The procedure is analogous for the different modes and no 

difference is expected. 

3 Results 

The natural frequency values of the three modes of vibration are summarized in Table 1 for all the tested 

scenarios. The corresponding hydrofoil mode shapes are presented in Figures 4, 5 and 6 where each mode 

shape is shown separately with a 3D graph. The visualization of the mode shapes under different 

conditions permits their comparison. In these plots, the yellow color denotes the maximum relative 

amplitude of vibration and the dark blue color denotes the minimum one. In this geometric simplification 

the TE is the left border. The corresponding numerical values (gain and phase) are summarized in Tables 

A.1, A.2 and A.3 in the appendix.

Figure 4. Mode shape visualizations for f1 under different fluid conditions. 

 

For the first bending mode, f1, there are no significant changes of the mode of vibration in terms of shape. 

However, important differences are found when comparing the vibration amplification factors of the 

surface points. The largest gains are found with air at all the points. Then, when the foil is submerged in 

still water, a 50% average reduction of gains is observed due to the increase of damping by the water 

loading relative to air. When the fluid is set in motion, a further reduction in gains is observed with an 

average of approximately 60% relative to air. This phenomenon is consistent with the experimental 

results obtained by Reese (2010) who stated that the total system damping increases again with the flow 

velocity due to the dynamic changes in the fluid flow. Finally, with the presence of partial cavitation, the 

average reduction is approximately 65%. These reductions are not so evident for higher order modes.

The first torsion, f2, and second bending, f3, modes exhibit some additional differences among the tested 

conditions because they present a nodal line (NL) on the hydrofoil’s surface. In particular, the f3 mode 

shape under a cavitating flow resembles a slightly coupled mode when animated. In particular, it seems 

that a bending-torsion mode starts to appear. In fact, it does not appear as clean as the movements under 

the other conditions and its NL location is very difficult to identify in this case. 

To better appreciate such mode shape alterations, the authors have compared the normalized gains 

relative to their maximum value for each flow condition on several specific points from Figure 3 (right). 

Moreover, a curve fit has been done to interpolate the gain values for the foil positions in spanwise 

direction between any two measurements with a method widely used in image correlation (Maude, A., 

1971). This method generates a continuous function G (and continuous first derivative) at all points and 

computes a weighted average following equation (1) and choosing W as indicated by equation (2). For the 

values in chordwise direction, a simple linear fit has been considered. And finally, the theoretical mode 

shapes have been calculated considering the hydrofoil as a cantilever beam and deriving the equations of 

motion of each mode according to the Euler-Bernoulli theory.

In Figures 7 and 8, the f3 and f2 normalized gains, their curve fits and the theoretical values have been 

plotted, respectively, for a set of points located close to the TE in the spanwise direction (points 1-2-3-4-

5-6). This particular location has been chosen because the thickness of the hydrofoil in this location is the 

lowest. For this particular reason, the results are expected to be closer to the theoretical approach based in 

the thin beam theory.

Figure 7. Second bending mode, f3, normalized gains relative to the maximum of measuring points 1-2-3-

4-5-6 aligned in the spanwise direction, their curve fits and the theoretical values for the different test 

conditions. 

As observed in Figure 7 from the curve fits, the NL in air is located at about 77.6% of the hydrofoil’s 

span which is very close to the beam theory prediction at 77.4%. When submerged in still water, the NL 

moves backwards to the clamped section at 69.8%. This result is qualitatively consistent with the findings 

of Lindholm et al. (1965) and Fu et al. (1987) who, unfortunately, could not quantify the NL movement. 

Additionally, this phenomenon seems to be enhanced by the lateral gap located between the hydrofoil’s 

tip and the plexiglass wall of the tunnel test section which is filled with fluid. This gap increases the 

added mass effect significantly as concluded by De La Torre et al. (2014). Finally, under flowing water 

conditions, the NL moves back to the tip of the hydrofoil up to about 72.6% which seems in good 

agreement with the behavior of the natural frequency that also increases (Table 1). Finally, for cavitating 

flow the NL keeps the same position than with flowing water. Because the differences in NL position are 

greater than 2% of the maximum expected error, we might conclude that they are caused by the flow 

condition.

Figure 8. First torsion mode, f2, normalized gains relative to the maximum of measuring points 1-2-3-4-5-

6 aligned in the spanwise direction, their curve fits and the theoretical values for the different test 

conditions. 

In Figure 8, it is clearly observed that the foil deformation measured in air agrees quite precisely with the 

theoretical prediction. In the case of still water, analogous results are obtained if the local measurement at 

position X=0.02 m is discarded. Then, for flowing water and cavitating conditions all the relative gains 

are reduced and the shapes differ from the previous ones especially when cavitation is present. 

In Figure 9, the f2 normalized gains, their curve fits and the theoretical values have been plotted for a set 

of points in the chordwise direction (points 1-7-11-17-21) that complement the analysis of this torsion 

mode since it is the visible location where more significant deformations are expected.

Figure 9. First torsion mode, f2, normalized gains relative to the maximum of measuring points 1-7-11-

17-21 aligned in the chordwise direction, their curve fits and the theoretical values for the different test 

conditions. 

In Figure 9, the NL for the air condition is located at about 51.5% of the hydrofoil’s chord. In this case, it 

is believed that the asymmetry of the profile moves the NL from the expected 50% position towards the 

LE. When submerged in still water, the NL moves to about 47.3% from the TE. Under flowing water 

condition, the NL moves back up to about 53.4%. And finally, with cavitation it is located at 44.5% that 

is the minimum distance from the TE. Again, the positional differences are slightly higher than the 2% 

maximum error threshold.  

In summary, submergence in still water produces a measurable displacement of the NL for both f2 and f3 

relative to air condition. Then, the NL displacement occurs in the opposite direction under flowing water 

relative to still water condition.

4 Discussion 

In particular, the observed changes of mode shapes with different flow conditions seem to be related with 

the changes of added mass. The added mass is essentially a function of the geometry of the surface, the 

position relative to the boundary conditions, the amplitude and direction of the vibration and a Reynolds-

like coefficient, as proposed by Blevins (1979). Nevertheless, this formulation does not explain the effect 

on the mode shapes. 

If we assume a finite element model and hence a matrix formulation for a body vibrating in fluid, its 

dynamic behavior can be represented by equation (3): 

(𝐌 + 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟)ẍ + (𝐂 + 𝐁𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟)ẋ + (𝐊 + 𝐃𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟)𝑥 = 𝐅  (3) 

where M, C and K stand for mass, damping and stiffness matrices, respectively; 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟, 𝐁𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 and 𝐃𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 

stand for added mass, added damping and added stiffness matrices, respectively; and F is the fluid 

loading matrix. As stated above, a change in M, C or K would not affect the eigenfunctions (mode 

shapes) of the modal coordinate system. To obtain solutions for different systems, the added matrices and 

the excitation forces should be different in nature because they are not only influenced by the boundary 

conditions of the structure. 

Regarding the added terms due to the fluid loading, the obtained results might be explained as follows:  

• The change between air and still water conditions is mainly due to the new 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 term. When 

submerged in a still dense fluid, the added mass effect is much more important than the added 

damping, and the added stiffness is almost negligible. 

• When setting the fluid in motion, an increase in the hydrodynamic damping might take place so 

that the new system’s solution is influenced by the 𝐁𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 matrix. 

• When cavitation appears, the pressure equilibrium between the upper and lower sides of the 

profile is not maintained, and as a result, a net torque appears along the spanwise axis. This 

torque could increase the 𝐃𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 term. Moreover, the 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 matrix has also changed due to the 

presence of a large vapor cavity within the fluid domain around the hydrofoil. In this case, the 

final mode shape configurations come from a new weighted combination of the 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟, 𝐁𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 and 

𝐃𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟𝐟 matrices.

Regarding the applied excitation forces, the currently tested conditions could be treated as one free 

vibration case (Air) and three forced vibration cases (Still Water, Flowing Water and Cavitating) for a 

cantilever beam. The free vibration case solution is given by function V(x) expressed with equation (4) 

where 𝛽𝑛 is a factor that depends on the n
th mode and 𝑙 is the beam length. Forced vibrations occur when 

the excitation force is different from zero. Under these circumstances, the solution is given by equation 

(5) where 𝑚𝑛 is the modal mass of the n
th mode, 𝜔𝑛 its natural frequency and 𝑄𝑛(𝑡) is defined by 

equation (6). Equation (5) has two different terms that are a transient one, which will decay after a long 

enough time, and a permanent one.  

𝑉(𝑥) = (cos𝛽𝑛𝑥 − cosh𝛽𝑛𝑥) −
cos𝛽𝑛𝑙 + cosh𝛽𝑛𝑙
sin𝛽𝑛𝑙 + sinh𝛽𝑛𝑙

(sin𝛽𝑛𝑥 − sinh𝛽𝑛𝑥)      (4) 

𝑉′𝑛(𝑥) = 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑚 +

𝑄𝑛(𝑡) = � 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑡)
𝑙

0
· 𝑉𝑛(𝑥)𝑑𝑥     (6) 

If we focus on the permanent term in equation (5) it is clear that, in general, it will be different to the one 

presented by equation (4). This is equivalent to say that its mode shapes and natural frequencies will be 

different because the excitation force greatly influences the system solution. Therefore, for different 

excitations we can expect different solutions as observed from the current experiments.  

Each forced vibration case creates differences in the loads applied to the cantilevered foil. Even if there is 

no net flow, the water viscosity might play a role when the structure moves relatively to it. Moreover, 

small scale flows might be generated at the profile’s edges producing measurable forces over the 

submerged structure. Finally, the presence of attached cavitation alters the whole pressure distribution 

around the hydrofoil. 

As a conclusion, it is evident that for each flow condition the theory predicts differences in the mode 

shapes as stated experimentally in the current work.

5 Conclusions 

The three first modes of vibration of a cantilevered NACA0009 hydrofoil have been identified, measured, 

visualized and compared under different conditions including air, still water, flowing water and 

cavitation. All the modes measured in air condition agree reasonably with the predicted ones by the thin 

beam theory of a cantilever beam. 

The first bending mode, f1, presents a reduction in the magnitude of the surface deformations relative to 

the air condition of approximately 50%, 60% or 65% when the hydrofoil is submerged in still water, 

flowing water or cavitating conditions, respectively. 

The presence of a nodal line, NL, for the torsion, f2, and the second bending, f3, modes permits to measure 

differences in the mode shapes related to a change in its position. Both modes present measurable 

displacements of their NL with maximum values of about 8 ± 2 % depending on the flow condition. The 

NL movements from air to still water and from still water to flowing water conditions occur in opposite 

directions. 

A leading edge cavity of approximately 50% of the chord causes a relevant change of the f3 mode shape 

that resembles a bending-torsion coupled mode.
