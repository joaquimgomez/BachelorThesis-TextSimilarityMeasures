Abstract. Experimental tests in prototype are necessary to understand the dynamic behaviour of 

the machine during different operating points. Hydraulic phenomena as well as its effect on the 

structure need to be studied in order to avoid instabilities during operation and to extend the life-

time of the different components. For this purpose, a complete experimental study of a large 

Francis turbine prototype has been performed installing several sensors along the machine. 

Pressure sensors were installed in the penstock, spiral case, runner and draft tube, strain gauges 

were installed in the runner, vibration sensors were used in the stationary parts and different 

electrical and operational parameters were also measured. All these signals were acquired 

simultaneously for different operating points of the turbine. 

1.  Introduction 

The dynamic behavior of Francis turbines is strongly dependent on their operating point [1]. There are 

certain points were instabilities could appear, affecting the hydraulic field, the structural parts but also 

the electrical output. Hydraulic resonances produced at part load [2] or full load [3] can affect the 

structure by oscillating the mechanical torque and resulting in oscillating output power, which in fact, 

is an important problem for the electrical grid stability. 

The hydraulic field is usually studied in models in laboratory and its behavior could be transposed to 

the prototype with rather good agreement [3]. However, its application to the structure is not the same 

in models than in prototype since the structural characteristics are rather different. As a consequence, 

some dynamic problems that appear in prototypes cannot be studied in models and therefore they need 

to be addressed on-site. However, on-site measurements are usually difficult to be performed since the 

installation of sensors inside the machine needs time, preparation and availability and the economic cost 

is high.  

In this paper an overview of experimental tests carried out in a large Francis turbine is presented. 

The turbine was selected for study under the European Project Hyperbole [4], where different 

companies, universities and research centers are involved. This turbine is located in British Columbia, 

Canada, and it has a rated power of 444 MW. The tests were performed during three weeks (November 

7th to November 27th 2016), using the first two weeks for isolation, installation of sensors and deisolation 

of the machine, one day for testing and the last week for dismantling and removing the sensors. 

2.  Participants 

Four different teams participated in the on-site measurements. A group of three people from Voith® 

participated installing strain gauges and pressure sensors in the runner, as well as a telemetry system to 

transfer the signals from the rotating to the stationary part. Two people from GE Renewable® installed 

pressure sensors in the penstock, spiral casing and draft tube. A group of three people from UPC

(Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona) installed vibration sensors in the stationary parts and 

coordinated all the measurements acquiring simultaneously all the sensors installed by the other partners. 

Finally, a group of three people from EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) calibrated the 

wicket gate opening angle with the servomotor stroke signal in order to compare results obtained with 

the model. 

3.  Description of the equipment 

3.1.  General sketch of all sensors installed 

Due to the big number of sensors and dimensions of the machine, a distributed measurement system 

was envisaged. The system from Bruel&Kjaer LAN XI Type 3053 was used for the tests. Figure 1 

shows a sketch off the sensors installed in every location of the machine. Each group of signals was 

sent to acquisition modules Pulse (7 modules of 12 channels). From each module an Ethernet cable 

was routed to a switch and then to the main computer with the software for acquisition and 

synchronization of all modules. In that way the length of the cables and installation time was 

minimized. Sensors were located in the hydraulic system, on-board on the turbine (on the runner and 

on the shaft), on the stationary system (bearings and shaft) and in the electrical system.

3.2.  Runner instrumentation 

24 strain gauges were located in two different blades of the runner. 8 pressure sensors were also installed 

in the same blades (Figure 2). The telemetry system was located in the cone of the runner and the rotating 

antenna was routed until the top of the shaft in the generator side. There, a stationary antenna was located 

and the signals were connected to the general acquisition system.

3.6.  Vibration measurements 

Several accelerometers were placed in the stationary parts of the machine: accelerometers in the bearings 

in radial and axial direction, on the head cover, on two different wicket gates, draft tube wall and casing. 

Moreover, four existing proximity probes (two in the turbine bearing and two in the generator bearing) 

were also used to measure shaft displacement. 

3.7.  Electrical measurements 

Active power and voltage and intensity of one phase were also acquired at the same time than the 

other signals. These signals were taken from existing transducers in the power plant. 

3.8.  Operating signals 

Rotational speed and wicket gate position were also taken from the existing Scada system and acquired 

simultaneously with the other signals. The upper and lower reservoir levels were also recorded during 

the tests. 

4.  Measurements 

4.1.  Measurements program 

The tests followed the following sequence that can be observed in Figure 6. Several ramp-ups and 

ramp-downs, staying at different loads to identify the instability regions were carried out. Condenser 

mode and a load rejection were also tested. Operating conditions tested on a reduced scale model were 

reproduced in the prototype. 

4.2.  Overview of the results 

As a first view, with the time signals of the different sensors, some instabilities can be observed. Figure 

7 shows the time signals for different operating points. For a certain range of power, at part load, the 

fluctuation of the signals as well as the power is of relevant importance. 

5.  Conclusions 

Experimental tests using several sensors on the rotating and stationary parts on a large Francis turbine 

prototype were successfully done. Pressure sensors were installed in the penstock, spiral case, runner 

and draft tube, strain gauges were installed in the runner, vibration sensors were used in the stationary 

parts and different electrical and operational parameters were also measured. All these signals were 

acquired simultaneously for different operating points of the turbine. 

Hydraulic resonances and instabilities were identified for different operating points with different 

sensors. Further analysis is necessary to understand the phenomena.
