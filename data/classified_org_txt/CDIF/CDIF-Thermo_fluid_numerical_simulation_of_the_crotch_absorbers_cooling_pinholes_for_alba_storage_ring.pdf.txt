Abstract 
The ALBA Synchrotron Light Facility crotch absorbers, 

that remove the unused storage ring radiation, incorporate 
an internal cooling system composed by a number of 
parallel pinholes and by the corresponding stainless steel 
inner tubes inserted into each of them. Water flows in the 
resulting annular sections to evacuate the total heat power. 
Around each inner tube, a spiral wire is fixed along the 
whole length with a given pitch height in order to enhance 
the convection heat transfer. The influence of several 
design parameters on the absorber thermo-fluid behaviour 
has been evaluated by means of the CFD software AN-
SYS CFX . In particular, the wall heat transfer coeffi-
cients and the pressure losses through a single pinhole 
have been evaluated for a range of different flow rates and 
pitch heights. Moreover, some modifications of the end 
wall geometry have been simulated as well as the effect of 
reversing the flow direction inside the channels. Finally, 
the critical crotch absorber type 3 has also been simulated 
and the limiting pitch height-flow rate combinations have 
been found based on the available driving pressure of the 
cooling system. 

INTRODUCTION 
Most of the synchrotron radiation generated by the 

bending magnets in the Storage Ring (around 95%) is 
absorbed in the crotch absorbers. An important challenge 
in the engineering of the crotch absorbers is the ability to 
withstand the temperature and thermal stress induced by 
the high heat load in the component materials within the 
accepted safety limits. For the critical crotch absorbers the 
peak linear and surface power densities at normal inci-
dence are about 64.4 W/mm and 246.2 W/mm2 respec-
tively, and the maximum total power is about 6.78 kW as 
presented in [1]. 

Due to this thermal load, the crotch absorber must be 
carefully designed to guarantee longevity and good per-
formance. A flow of water at 23 C circulates inside the 
absorber through a series of pinholes to cool it. Hence 
extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) work 
has been conducted on various aspects of a single pinhole 
design such as the spiral wire pitch height, the flow rate, 
the direction of the flow and the end wall geometry. This 

work is of interest since few information is available for 
design, only the empirical correlations from [2] provide 
the wall heat transfer coefficients for a couple of pitch 
heights in a similar pinhole design but with different di-
mensions. Based on the previous results, several pinholes 
connected in series have also been simulated.

The current design of ALBA crotch absorbers is shown 
in Fig. 1. A detail of the spiral wire at the end wall and the 
two possible flow directions, forward and reverse, are 
indicated in Fig. 2.

CFD MODEL 
A mesh sensitivity analysis has been carried out to 

identify the optimal mesh for the model. As a result, a 
final mesh of about 1.5 M elements with good quality has 
been used for a single pinhole. The total thermal load has 
been uniformly distributed along the contact wall surface 
with the fluid. At the inlet, the mass flow rate has been 
imposed ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 kg/s. At the outlet, the 
boundary condition has been set constant to a relative

pressure of 0 Pa. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbu-
lence model has been used. 

SINGLE PINHOLE 
Effect of Pitch and Flow Direction 

For a fixed mass flow rate of 0.06 kg/s, the effect of in-
creasing the pitch height from 0.005 to 0.05 m on the 
pressures loss and the average wall heat transfer coeffi-
cient is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. Both 
parameters tend to decrease as the pitch is increased. The 
maximum heat transfer coefficient and pressure loss are 
found for the minimum pitch height. For pitch heights 
above 0.03 m, the effects are insignificant. 

In relation to the flow direction, a slightly higher heat 
transfer coefficient is achieved in the whole range of flow 
rates with the reverse sense. Moreover, the pressure losses 
are significantly reduced. Therefore, the global perfor-
mance of the reverse flow is clearly superior to the for-
ward flow.

forward and reverse flow. 

 
Figure 4: Wall heat transfer coefficient as a function of 
pitch height for forward and reverse flow. 

The flow streamlines inside the pinhole for a reverse 
flow rate of 0.06 kg/s and a pitch height of 0.03 m are 
plotted in Fig. 5. The guiding effect of the spiral wire on 
the flow orientation is clearly observed within the annular 
section. 

Effect of Pitch and Mass Flow Rate 
The effect of increasing the forward flow rate is ob-

served in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 for the pressure loss and the 

average wall heat transfer coefficient, respectively. For 
the reverse flow, analogous results are obtained. 

The pressure losses increase following a power law as 
the flow rate increases. Meanwhile, the heat transfer coef-
ficients appear to increase linearly with the flow rate. The 
results obviously indicate that the maximum heat transfer 
coefficient is found for the highest flow rate and the min-
imum pitch height. For this condition, the maximum pres-
sure loss is also found.

Effect of end Wall Geometry and Mass Flow 
Rate 

As it can be seen in Fig. 5, the strongest flow perturba-
tions and maximum velocities are found at the end of the 
pinhole. In this location also the maximum temperatures 
are found as shown in Fig. 11. Consequently, a verifica-
tion of the already predicted influence of the end wall 
geometry [1] has been carried out. The current flat wall 
and two cone-type configurations (inward and outward) 
have been simulated to determine the optimal one. 

The pressure losses and the average wall heat transfer 
coefficients have been compared in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, 
respectively, for the three geometries in the case of re-
verse flow and a pitch height of 0.015 m. It can be ob-
served that the geometry change has an insignificant ef-
fect on the average heat transfer but a significant effect on 
the total pressure loss. The inward cone presents the min-
imum pressure losses for all the mass flow rates. There-
fore, this wall geometry optimizes the flow 180  turna-
round at the end of the pinhole.

flow rate for different end wall geometries.

MULTIPLE PINHOLES 
To finish, the complete cooling system of a type 3 

crotch absorber composed of two independent circuits 
with 4 pinholes each has been simulated. Given the sym-
metrical design of the piece, only the performance of one 
circuit has been considered and the results of pressure loss 
have been presented in Fig. 10. 

The current cooling system of the Storage Ring can 
provide a maximum pressure level at the entrance of the 
crotch absorbers of about 6 105 Pa (6 bar). As a result, the 
unfeasible combinations of flow rate and pitch height 
have been shaded in Fig. 10 with red colour. Thus, only 
the remaining values are the possible ones to design an 
adequate system from the hydraulic point of view. 

In Fig. 11, the wall temperature distribution indicates 
that maximum levels are found at the end walls of two 
pinholes located on the left.

for different pitch heights in crotch absorber type 3. Red 
area conditions are not possible due to insufficient driving 
pressure.

connected pinholes of the crotch absorber type 3. 

CONCLUSION 
The CFD simulation of the thermo-hydraulic behaviour 

of the crotch absorber’s cooling pinholes has leaded to the 
following conclusions: 

 Minimum pitch height and maximum flow rate 
maximizes the convective heat transfer but also 
requires the highest driving pressure. 

 Reverse flow performance is better than forward 
one. 

 Optimal end wall geometry is outward cone type. 
 SR available driving pressure limits the choice of 

design parameters.
