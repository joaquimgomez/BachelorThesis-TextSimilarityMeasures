Abstract 
The ALBA Synchrotron Light Source cooling system is 

submitted to regular pump start-ups and shut-downs. 
Moreover, pumps can trip due to motor power failures. As 
a result, the piping system can be subjected to surges and 
pressure oscillations. The 1D thermo-fluid simulation 
software Flowmaster  has been used to predict these 
transient conditions taking into account the fluid com-
pressibility, the pipe elasticity, the characteristic time 
response of the check valves and the pump/motors mo-
ments of inertia. During pump start-ups, significant pres-
sure rises are detected that can be reduced by readjusting 
the PID controller parameters. Unexpected pump shut-
downs do not appear to provoke significant water hammer 
conditions. However, pressure fluctuations are generated 
mainly in the same pumping line but also in the rest of the 
system due to the particular common return configuration. 
In all the cases the pressure regulation mechanisms acting 
on the pump rotating speeds serve to attenuate the conse-
quences of these transients. Finally, the feasibility of the 
model to simulate the effect on the system response of 
trapped air inside the pipes has also been evaluated. 

INTRODUCTION 
The Consortium for the Exploitation of the Synchrotron 

Light Laboratory (CELLS) is in implementation state of a 
transversal project whose objective is to develop and 
improve the ALBA’s synchrotron cooling system. It is 
aimed at improving the system reliability and stability 
faced to flow changes induced during normal operation 
and occasional failures. 

One particular activity consists of understanding the 
cooling system response to start-up and shut-down of any 
pump device in the cooling system and detecting if pres-
sure variations created in transient events may lead to 
failures and/or piping components’ deterioration. 

It is well known that transient flow conditions in piping 
systems with large flow rates can cause unwanted water 
hammer problems. Water hammer creates high amplitude 
pressure waves that travel back and forth inside the pipe 
network until they are dissipated by friction [1-2]. Exces-
sive high pressures can lead to damage or rupture of 

pumps and valves. Excessive low pressures can lead to air 
entrance, cavitation and release of large amounts of dis-
solved air.  

Faced with the difficulty and risk of carrying out exper-
imental tests on the actual pipe network, it has been de-
cided to use the existing Flowmaster® model [3] to simu-
late numerically the system response. For that, the model 
has been modified to take into account the inertial and 
compressibility effects in pumps and pipes by replacing 
and adding the adequate components. In addition, it has 
also been necessary to program new scripts and to make 
changes in the PID controllers in order to simulate the 
real pumping system start-up/shut-down procedures. 

NUMERICAL MODEL 
A key parameter to calculate water hammer phenome-

non in pipes is the pressure wave propagation speed, a, 
that can be estimated with Eq. (1) where B is the bulk 
modulus of elasticity of the liquid,  is the fluid density, 
D is pipe diameter, e is the pipe wall thickness and E is 
the modulus of elasticity of the pipe wall material. 

      (1)  

For example, the wave speed a is around 1200 m/s for 
water at 23 C flowing inside a stainless steel pipe of size 
DN 150 Sch 10. Accordingly, the adequate wave speed 
for all the different pipe sizes of the network have been 
calculated and used in the model. 

Most common causes of transient problems in pipe sys-
tems are the pump start-up and pump shut-down due to a 
power failure (pump trip). To correctly simulate these 
effects the pump and the motor moments of inertia must 
be included in the model. For that, the Thorley empirical 
equations have been used [4]. The motor inertia, Im, and 
the pump inertia, Ip, have been calculated with Eq. 2 and 
Eq. 3, respectively, where P is the brake horsepower in 
kW and N is the rotational speed in rpm.

The generation side of the cooling system is comprised 

of four pumping stations named P07, P08, P09 and P10 
for the Experimental Area (EA), the Storage (SR), the 
Booster (BO) and the Service Area (SA) consumption 
rings, respectively. In P08 and P10 two pumps operate 
simultaneously in parallel, meanwhile in P07 and P09 
only one pump is working. Another pump, P11, is in

charge of delivering the hot water to the chillers that cool 
it down again. Accordingly, the adequate moments of 
inertia for all the different pump sizes have been calculat-
ed and used in the model. 

Finally, the non-return valves mounted at the discharge 
pipe lines have also been modelled. They are tilting disk 
check valves that only allow the passage of the fluid in a 
single direction shown in Fig. 1. If the flow tries to return, 
the valve will prevent this by shutting under its’ own 
weigh. To model them, a characteristic operating time of 
1 s and a minimum flow velocity of 0.6 m/s were as-
sumed.

charge pipeline (arrow indicates permitted flow sense). 

It must be noted that the cooling system presents sever-
al regulation mechanisms that are automatically applied to 
guarantee hydraulic and thermal stability. All of them 
have been considered in the current model. In terms of 
pump pressures, a series of proportional–integral–
derivative controllers (PID’s) try to maintain the maxi-
mum values below a fixed set-point by regulating the 
pump’s rotational speed. In terms of water temperature, a 
series of mixing valves and chillers ensure a temperature 
of 23 C at the consumption rings also by means of PID’s 
controllers acting on three-way valves and heat exchang-
ers. 

SIMULATED RESPONSE 
Normal Pumping System Start-Up 

The typical start-up procedure is carried out sequential-
ly starting from pump P11 and finishing with the two 
pumps in P10 as indicated in Fig. 2. The total time takes 
around 100 s.  

 
Figure 2: Selected instants of time for each pumping sta-
tion start-up based on current practice by ALBA opera-
tors. 

As it can be seen in Fig. 3, for each pump start-up the 
corresponding delivery pressure rises above the pressure 

set-point during a certain period of time. The highest 
pressure increase is found in P09, reaching the 54% of its 
set point value, which is 1.02·107 Pa. Meanwhile, the 
lowest overpressure is produced by pump P11. The reason 
for that is the observed delay time between PID controller 
and pump. 

 
Figure 3: Pump delivery pressures during the initial sec-
onds of sequential start-up. 

In order to reduce such overpressures that might dam-
age the system components, an adequate modification of 
the PID controller’s characteristic values has been prelim-
inary investigated with the model. Some results are shown 
in Fig. 4 for P09. It has been found that adjusting the 
proportional constant, Kp, around a value of 1, the pres-
sure increase can be reduced to 32% of the set point. 
Regarding the integral and derivative constants, the simu-
lations did not show any significant improvement in 
overpressure levels.

pressure evolution during P09 start-up. 

Pump Trip Without Thermal Load 
The effects of the unexpected shut-down of only one of 

the pumps in P08 station have been simulated without 
thermal demand and the mixing valves at 50% opening 
ratio. As it can be observed in Fig. 5, the closure of the 
check valve happens around 0.8 s after the pump trip. As 
a result, there is a reverse flow during 0.3 s until the valve 
closes completely. At this point, a typical water hammer 
disturbance is generated through all the pumping lines. 
Fortunately the pressure wave is of low amplitude and 
short duration. 

It must be noted that the expansion wave at the pump 
inlet seems to reach the vapour pressure, which could 
induce cavitation. After the water hammer, a low frequen-
cy fluctuation is generated in the system that disappears 
after 20 s.

Another point of interest is the significant effect ob-
served in P11 rotational speed and the common return 
pipe during the transient. 

At the end, the second pump is capable of compensat-
ing the lack of flow from the tipped pump and the original 
pressure set-point is achieved. However, this is not the 
case in P10 pumping line and at the end of the transient 
the system cannot maintain the nominal flow rate and 
delivery pressure.

sures and the check valve position after a pump trip. 

Pump Trip with Thermal Load 
In the case that the synchrotron light source is at full 

operation, the most critical case corresponds to a pump 
trip effecting P11 which is responsible of feeding the 
chillers to reduce the temperature of the cooling system 
water. 

The simulated evolution of the mixed water tempera-
ture at each of the consumption rings after a P11 trip is 
shown in Fig. 6. It is significant to note that, due to the 
length of the pipe network, the consequences take around 
600 s to reach the rings. At this end point, the system is 
obviously unable to cool the water anymore if P11 is not 
started again. 

 
Figure 6: Temperature evolution at ring’s inlets after a 
P11 pump trip occurring at time 0 s. 

Normal Pumping System Shut-Down 
The system pressure response to a simultaneous stop-

page of all the pumps once the thermal demand is already 
closed is presented in Fig. 7. Some oscillations are detect-
ed in all the pumping lines but they are rapidly attenuated. 
This procedure is not currently being applied in ALBA, 
which is actually a sequential shut-down of the pumping 
lines what makes the consequences even softer. 

Effect of Trapped Air 
In Fig. 8 it can be seen that the presence of an accumu-

lator of air at the exit of the ring when the flow in this 
ring is stopped due to a pump shut-down damps the am-
plitude of the pressure oscillations and increases the peri-
od.

simultaneous pump shut-down.

ing station shut-down for different air volumes. 

CONCLUSION 
The normal start-up manoeuvre of the pumping system 

has been simulated and the fluid dynamic response has 
been analysed. The results indicate the generation of sig-
nificant pressure rises. To mitigate them, changes in the 
PID controller parameters have been proposed, improving 
the transient behaviour reducing such peaks. 

The simulation and analysis of sudden pumps’ shut-
downs due to system unexpected failures has served to 
identify the consequences on the system behaviour. The 
calculations have been carried out without and with sim-
ultaneous thermal regulation. The results serve to identify 
the most dangerous situations and the time spans of the 
transient events. This information can be used to predict 
undesired behaviours. 

Finally, the effect of air in the pipes has been analysed 
during the pump shut-down and it has been confirmed 
that the transient pressure fluctuations predicted in the 
system are modified.
