Abstract. The added mass effects on a NACA0009 hydrofoil under cavitation conditions 
determined in a cavitation tunnel have been numerically simulated using finite element method 
(FEM). Based on the validated model, the effects of averaged properties of the cavity 
considered as a two-phase mixture have been evaluated. The results indicate that the void ratio 
of the cavity plays an increasing role on the frequency reduction ratio and on the mode shape 
as the mode number increases. Moreover, the sound speed shows a more important role than 
the average cavity density. 

1.  Introduction 
At present, FEM-based acoustic fluid approach to simulate the added mass effect of surrounding water 
has been widely used in hydraulic turbine runners with sufficient accuracy as for example by Liang, et 
al. [1]. Nevertheless, this method has not yet been used to estimate the added mass effects on 
hydrofoils under cavitation conditions. In fact, the experimental results indicate that the actual 
macroscopic hydrodynamic cavities are composed of a mixture of water and vapour phases. As a 
result, averaged properties must be considered in the model that are difficult to quantify and that vary 
from the expected effects of pure liquid water flow. Moreover, new boundary conditions at cavitation 
regions appear that are not fully understood. 

Consequently, the research purpose of this work is to use a numerical Fluid Structure Interaction 
(FSI) approach for evaluation of the significance of cavitation void ratio on the dynamic response of 
an hydrofoil. For that, the numerical results for a NACA0009 hydrofoil with partial cavitation have 
been compared with the experimental ones obtained by De La Torre, et al. [2] assuming that the cavity 
is composed of a single fluid phase of pure vapour. With the validated model and based on the 
possibilities of the numerical approach, a study of the effects that the two-phase flow properties have 
on the hydrofoil modes of vibration (natural frequencies and mode shapes) of the coupled system have 
been explored.

In FSI problems, the structural dynamics equation must be considered along with the Navier-Stokes 
(NS) and the continuity equations. The discretized structural dynamics equation can be formulated 
based on the structural elements. The NS and continuity equations are simplified to get the acoustic 
wave equation assuming that the fluid is compressible, which means that its density changes due to 
pressure variations (i.e. acoustic medium), and that there is no fluid flow [3].  

The governing finite element matrix equations of FSI are expressed in Equation (1):

3.  FEM model 
The simulated case corresponds to a NACA0009 hydrofoil, as shown in Figure 1, under various 
cavitation conditions experimentally tested at the EPFL High-Speed Cavitation Tunnel. On the left of 
Figure 3, a photograph of the typical attached partial cavitation as described in De La Torre, et al. [2] 
is shown. The foil is made of aluminum alloy with a Young’s modulus of 0.54 GPa, a Poisson’s ratio 
of 0.33 and a density of 2770 kg/m3.

The FSI domain, which comprises the whole test section of the cavitation tunnel, was meshed with 
hexahedral elements as shown in Figure 2. The hydrofoil was fixed with an incidence angle of 0º.

the structure is identical to that of the fluid in normal direction. Considering the coupling 
characteristics of vibration in water, the fluid boundaries were modeled as fully reflective. The water 
properties were set as 1000 kg/m3 for density and 1450 m/s for speed of sound. 

Regarding the modelling of the attached cavity, it was considered to be of a constant length along 
the whole span as shown on the right of Figure 3. Acoustic elements were used like for the water 
domain. At the interface of the vapor cavity with the surrounding water, the acoustic pressure and the 
normal component of the water/vapor velocity are continuous. The vapor properties were set as 0.174 
kg/m3 for density and 340 m/s for speed of sound.

4.  Results 
The modal behaviour of the hydrofoil resembles that of a cantilever beam. The three first modes of 
vibration correspond to the first bending (f1), the first torsion (f2) and the second bending (f3). To 
evaluate the changes of natural frequency with void ratio induced by the added mass effects, the 
Frequency Reduction Ratio in percent for mode i, FRRi, has been calculated as expressed in Equation 
(2):

where fi,α=1 and fi,α are the mode i natural frequencies for void ratio 1 and for any void ratio α, 
respectively. 

As it can be observed on the left of Figure 4, Brennen [4] states that the cavity density and the 
speed of sound in a mixture of water and vapor is a function of the void ratio, α, which is in turn the 
ratio between the vapor volume and the total cavity volume. Based on such data, a series of cases have 
been simulated considering the cavity domain void ratio in the range from 0.6 to 1, as shown on the 
right of Figure 4, while keeping the same cavity length and thickness and the same properties of the 
water domain around the cavity. As it can be observed from the results, both the FRR and the mode 
shape are affected by the changes in cavity properties. The significant effect of cavity void ratio on 
natural frequencies is parallel to a significant effect on mode shapes especially for mode f3 and 
followed by mode f2. Meanwhile, for mode f1 the effects on the shape are almost negligible. 

The predicted mode evolutions are in fact induced by the particular sonic speed and averaged cavity 
density values considered in each case. These couple of variables are directly linked so it is difficult to 
determine their individual level of significance on the obtained results. To clarify this point, a series of 
simulations have been carried out by keeping one factor constant and changing the other although they 
are not physically accurate for large deviations from Brennen’s data. To begin, the density has been 
reduced from 1000 kg/m3 to 0.174 kg/m3 while keeping the sonic velocity constant at 340 m/s. These 
results are plotted on the left of Figure 5 and they indicate that the density of the cavity has a low 
influence on the natural frequency change of each mode. Only when the density is lower than 100 
kg/m3, the increase of the natural frequencies is larger, but still not significant. Contrarily, the role of

the sonic velocity is dominant as it can be observed on the right of Figure 5 when it is reduced from 
1480 to 24 m/s while keeping the density constant at 0.174 kg/m3. The results for all the modes of 
vibration show that the natural frequency changes significantly in a particular range of values and that 
outside such range it is almost constant. In particular, the frequency changes linearly with the sonic 
velocity following a common diagonal line for all the modes that we call “Mode Transition Line”.

5.  Conclusion 
The added mass effects on a NACA0009 hydrofoil under cavitation conditions have been numerically 
calculated using acoustic FEM. The results show that the reduction of void ratio from 1 to 0.6 
increases the added mass effects and modifies the mode shapes more significantly for higher order 
modes. In particular, the sonic speed is more relevant than the average density on the modal behavior.
