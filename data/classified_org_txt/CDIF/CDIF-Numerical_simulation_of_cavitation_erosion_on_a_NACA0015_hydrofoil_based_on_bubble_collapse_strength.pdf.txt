Abstract. The prediction of erosion under unsteady cavitation is crucial to prevent damage in
hydraulic machinery. The present investigation deals with the numerical simulation of erosive
partial cavitation around a NACA0015 hydrofoil. The study presents the calculation of the
bubble collapse strength, Sb, based on the bubble potential energy to identify the surface areas
with highest risk of damage. The results are obtained with a numerical scheme assuming
homogeneous mixture flow, implicit LES and Zwart cavitation model. The 3D unsteady flow
simulation has been solved using OpenFOAM. Python language and OpenFOAM calculator
(foamCalcEx) have been used to obtain and represent Sb. The obtained results clearly show
the instants of erosive bubble collapse and the affected surface areas.

1. Introduction
Cavitation erosion has been a subject of deep study for long time using different techniques [1].
The main methods, which have permitted to understand the mechanisms of the phenomenon
and the damage generation, are experimental correlations with noise, vibrations and material
properties [2, 3]; analytical methods, such as pit distribution quantification by image
processing [4, 5]; and numerical simulations using special turbulence models to reproduce
cavitation morphology and dynamic behavior [6]. For the latter, Kubota et al. [7] introduced the
idea of homogeneous mixture flow with the bubble two-phase flow (BTF) model. Then Coutier
et al. [8] showed that the condensation and vaporization processes are controlled by a barotropic
state law and simulated the cavity shedding in a venturi. The research works on horse-shoe
vortex structures shed around a twisted hydrofoil [9] and on the transient sheet-cloud cavitating
flows [10] also corroborate the validity of the homogeneous mixture flow models.

Regarding the cavitation erosion models, Van et al. [11] revised some models. In those models,
the potential energy of the bubble, Ep, is described as main erosion factor when a group of
bubbles collapse simultaneously in cascade and the gap between the wall and the cloud of bubbles
is very thin. However, Dular et al. [4] indicated that erosion is also due to the re-energizing of
bubbles close to the walls and the generation of high speed jets, which showed speeds close to 100
m/s. In this context, Li [6] proposed the pressure gradient, ∂p/∂t, as a new erosion index based
on Ep. Moreover, Bergeles et al. [12] presented the cavitation aggressiveness index(CAI) based
on total derivatives of pressure, vapor fraction and the Rayleigh-Plesset equations for unsteady

and quasi steady flow calculation. However, the CAI equation is not directly correlated with
the quantity of energy liberated in the bubble collapse. Consequently, the quantification of this
energy is still a challenge.

Bearing in mind these aspects, the present investigation presents a numerical simulation
method based on homogeneous mixture flow assumption using implicit LES and the Zwart-
Gerber-Belamri cavitation model to predict the cavitation erosion at high Reynolds numbers [13,
14]. The proposed collapse strength, Sb, is based on the erosion index proposed by Li [6].
Additionally, the pressure implicit with splitting of operators (PISO) algorithm [13] is used to
solve the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the behavior of unsteady flow on a NACA0015
hydrofoil.

2. Model description
2.1. Homogeneous mixture flows
The two-phase flow is modeled in each control as homogeneous mixture with vapor volume
fraction, αi, as indicated in equations (1) and (2)

αi =
∀Vi
∀i
, (1)

∂(αiρV)

∂t
+∇(αiρVU) = ṁ, (2)

where ∀Vi and ∀i are the vapor and total volume respectively, ρV is the vapor density, U is the
velocity and ṁ is the inter-phase mass transfer rate per unit volume. Moreover, ∀i is considerer
as constant value, and ṁ is a source term, which is decided based on the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri
cavitation model and it can be calculated using the equation (3).

where p and pV are the pressure and vapor saturation pressure respectively, FV = 300
and FC = 0.03 are the selected calibration constants for vaporization and condensation,
rnuc = 5.0 × 10−6 is the nucleation site volume fraction, RB = 1.0 × 10−6 m is the typical
bubble size in water [14].

2.2. Bubble collapse strength
The total energy of one bubble in a control volume, Ebi, is the sum of potential energy, Epi,
and kinetic energy, Eki. However, the potential term is more important than the kinetic term
(Epi >> Eki) because before the collapse the bubble velocity is low. Therefore, the bubble
collapse strength, Sb, calculated with equation (4) can be considered as an updated model to
evaluate cavitation aggressiveness.

where n is the control volume number that presents cavitation in the computational domain.
To calculate Sb, an algorithm based on foamCalcEx and Python language has been developed.

Obviously, to produce plastic deformation and erosion on solid parts, the Sb must be higher
than the material threshold resistance, SM , which quantifies the material resistance to cavitation

accumulative bubble collapse strength, SbT , that causes damage can be calculated within one
cycle of cavitation shedding process with equation (5):

where N is the number of the given results in one cycle, t0 and tf are the initial and final time.

2.3. Implicit LES formulation
The implicit LES formulation, ILES, is indicated in equation (6) with the filtered operations [13,
14].

. (6)

The subgrid stress tensor τ ′ij is a nonlinear term, so it is separated as indicated in equation (7).

τ ′ij = ρ(uiuj − uiuj + τ̃ ′ij), (7)

where, the tensor τ̃ ′ij is modeled by using the truncation error to act as a dissipative action to
avoid the explicit subgrid scale model (SGS) of LES [14].

3. Computational domain and boundary conditions
The computational domain and the main boundary conditions are indicated in figure 1. The
free stream inlet velocity, U∞, is 17.3 m/s, the outlet pressure, p∞, is 302 kPa and the cavitation
number, σ, is 2.01. The chord length of the hydrofoil NACA0015, c, is 60 mm with an angle

of attack, ÂOA, of 8 ◦. A structured mesh with 878280 hexahedron elements suitable for the
ILES conditions of y+ equal to 2.0 has been built. The quality of mesh has been checked by the
analysis of the diagonals and Jacobians of the hexahedron [15].

4. Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the simulated unsteady partial cavitation on the hydrofoil suction side at three
different times within one shedding cycle from 0.01 s to 0.0175 s. The images show: (a) the
cavity sheet, (b) the shedding of cavitation clouds and (c) the formation of a horse-shoe cavity

convected downstream by the main flow. The hydrofoil surface areas exposed to possible erosive
bubble collapses have been identified from the control volumes with highest Sb values. From
the results, it is confirmed that the highest aggressiveness takes place during the collapses as
shown in figure 2(b). On the contrary, during the reentrant jet formation and the collapse of
horse-shoe cloud shown in figure 2(c) only small areas are slightly affected by collapses. This
might be due to a large distance between the bubbles and the hydrofoil surface. Results are
similar to analogous risk assessment models and experiments [6].

5. Conclusions
A numerical simulation of cavitation erosion on a NACA0015 has been carried out with
a free OpenFOAM software package and an algorithm based on foamCalcEx and Python
language. The bubble collapse strength has been calculated based on the potential energy and
homogeneous mixture flow assumption using implicit LES and Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation
model. Results confirm the suitability of using Sb and the developed algorithm for cavitation
erosion prediction.
