ABSTRACT

Vortex generators (VG) are used increasingly by wind turbine industry as flow control devices to improve rotor blade

performance. According to experimental observations, the vortices generated by VGs have previously been observed to

be self-similar for both the axial (uz) and azimuthal (uθ) velocity components. Furthermore, the measured vortices have

been observed to obey the criteria for helical symmetry. These are powerful results, since it reduces the highly complex

3D-flow to merely four parameters and therefore significantly facilitates the modeling of this type of flow, which in a larger

perspective can assist in parametric studies to increase the total power output of wind turbines. In this study, corresponding

computer simulations using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations have been carried out and compared to the

experimental observations. The main objective is to investigate how well the simulations can reproduce these aspects

of the physics of the flow, i.e., investigate if the same analytical model can be applied and therefore significantly facilitates

the modeling of this type of flow, which in a larger perspective can assist in parametric studies to increase the total power

output of wind turbines. This is especially interesting since these types of flows are notoriously difficult for the turbulence

models to predict correctly. Using this model, parametric studies can be significantly reduced and, moreover, reliable

simulations can substantially reduce the costs of the parametric studies themselves. Copyright c© 2010 John Wiley &

Self-similarity and helical symmetry in VG flow simulations U. Fernández-Gámiz et al.

1. INTRODUCTION

Research has been carried out on Vortex Generators (VGs) in applied aerodynamics on airplane wings for more than sixty

years [1, 2, 3]. VGs are passive devices for flow control that enhance mixing of the boundary layer and can thus transfer

high momentum fluid closer to the wall and thereby suppress separation [4]. An extensive range of conventional vortex

generators are in use for successful engineering applications of flow separation control, since controlled near-wall vortices

can transport both heat and momentum, aiding in cooling and re-energizing the lowest part of the boundary layer. The fluid

particles with great streamwise momentum are swept along helical trajectories toward the surface to mix with and, to some

extend, to restore the retarded near-wall flow. Therefore, it is important to be able to control and optimize parameters such

as the vortex strength and vortex core size to the existing flow setting, [5]. On wind turbine blades VGs are usually mounted

in a spanwise array on the suction side of the blade and have the advantage that they can be added as a post-production fix

to blades that do not perform as expected. An overview of different airfoils with several VG options is listed in van Rooij

et al. [6]. They are further frequently employed on, e.g., wind turbine blades to enable production of more slender blades.

That is, the width of a blade can be reduced, thereby also reducing the weight for the same load distribution and power

production and thus facilitating up-scaling of the turbines.

These devices are commonly triangular or rectangular vanes inclined at an angle of attack to the oncoming flow. They are

normally dimensioned in relation to the local boundary layer thickness to obtain optimal interaction between the vortex and

boundary layer, and are frequently arranged in pairs, producing counter-rotating vortices, upstream of the flow separation

area [7, 8]. Basic research on Vortex Generators mounted on a flat plate has previously been the concern of several

researchers, see e.g. Lin [7]. For an example of successful control of a laminar separation bubble with significant drag

reduction, see the research at moderate Reynolds number carried out by Kerho et al. [9]. Also Lin [7] observed the Drag

reducing and Lift increasing effects of micro VGs. Wendt [10] investigated an array of VGs in an experiment where the

VGs were mounted in a fashion to generate counter-rotating vortices. Furthermore, the experimental and numerical studies

carried out by Ashill et al. [11, 12] revealed a successful delaying of the shock-induced separation by the implementation

of Sub Boundary-Layer Vortex Generators (SBVG). Two series of investigations were presented at both zero and adverse

streamwise pressure gradients, where vortex decay and device drag were reasonably well predicted by the RANS based

computations.

The effect of VGs on a 1 MW Wind Turbine was investigated by Øye [13] and Miller [14], who compared the measured

power curves on a a (however optimistically designed) wind turbine with and without VGs. Though quite rough methods

for the optimization of the VG design were employed, these studies showed that in the case under investigation the VGs

on average increased the output power for nearly all wind speeds. Adding VGs to wind turbine blades is often a simple

measure to improve the performance of a rotor, though great care needs to be taken not to deteriorate the performance

of the wind turbine, or, even worse, to change the aeroelastic performance adversely so that the wind turbine becomes

destabilized. This can significantly reduce the lifetime of the wind turbine, which further highlights the need of proper

models for VGs.

Many models for the generated vortices have been presented over the years. Theoretical models include, for example, the

one by Smith [15] and a model presented by Velte et al. [5] that was developed and applied to show the helical symmetry of

the vortices generated by a passive rectangular vane-type vortex generator. As for more practically and numerically oriented

models incorporated into codes, most are variants of the practical BAY-model by Bender et al. [16], which introduces body

forces using source terms in the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the presence of a vane.

The fact that the vortices produced by vortex generators possess helical symmetry means, in effect, that the streamwise

profiles (uz), along the longitudinal vortex axis and the rotational (uθ) flows are inter-related by a simple linear relation

based on the helical shape of the vorticity lines [5, 17]. Further, previous experimental work by Velte [18] examines the

downstream vortex evolution behind a cascade of vortex generators producing counter-rotating vortices in a boundary

layer of negligible streamwise pressure gradient. The model parameters are all seen to vary linearly in the downstream

direction. Based on the experimental observations of [18], the vortices generated by vortex generators have been observed

to be self-similar (see, e.g., White [19] and Figure 1) for both the axial (uz) and azimuthal (uθ) velocity profiles. If the

flow, i.e., the set of four helical parameters (u0, l, Γ, ε), is known at one single position, the flow can therefore be extended

to include the full downstream evolution of the developed part of the vortex using self-similarity scaling arguments. This

knowledge is important for fundamental understanding as well as for the aspect of applications, for which parametric

experiments can be substantially reduced in terms of required time and cost. This would, in turn, simplify the process of

improving existing wind turbine designs using retro-fits or the upscaling of wind turbines, as described above. Note that, in

practice, VGs are often optimized using CFD methods because of the relatively low cost and fast acquisition of the results.

However, the performance of CFD codes to predict this complex wall-bounded flow correctly still remains to be properly

validated and the present study therefore suggests a quantitative method comparing experimental and computational results

describing the complete set of aspects describing the VG induced wake. Hence, before attempting the extremely complex

three-dimensional and rotating flow on a wind turbine blade, the present study based on a more simple setup can be used

as a preliminary orientation for successful implementation of VGs on wind turbine rotor blades. To the knowledge of the

authors, this kind of comparison has previously only been done in a qualitative fashion or only quantitatively to some

extent.

In the present study CFD simulations have therefore been carried out using the DTU/RISØ in-house EllipSys3D CFD

code (Michelsen [20] and Sørensen [21]) and compared with wind tunnel experiments, where a test case was performed

over a single vane mounted on the test section wall in a low-speed wind tunnel [18]. The main objective of this work is

to investigate how well the simulations can reproduce the physics of the flow and if the same analytical model can be

applied to the computer simulated results. The results show that CFD is able to capture the same overall flow trends as the

measured ones. Using this model, parametric studies can be significantly reduced and, furthermore, reliable simulations

can substantially reduce the costs and time requirements of the parametric studies themselves.

In this study, steady state simulations were carried out and compared to experimental observations. These computations

were performed using the EllipSys3D code, see Michelsen [20] and Sørensen [21]. This in-house CFD code is a structured

finite-volume flow solver using, in this work, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The pressure/velocity coupling

is ensured using the SIMPLE algorithm. The convective terms are discretized utilising the third order Quadratic Upstream

Interpolation for Convective Kinematics (QUICK), [22]. For these computations the k − ω SST (Shear Stress Transport)

turbulence model by Menter [23] was used. A successful validation of steady RANS simulations against measurements

is the one carried out by Allan [24], where the flow field about a single VG on a flat plate with two different vane angle-

of-attack was computed using a flow solver code developed at NASA. The results of these simulations were compared to

experimental data and showed that the CFD and experiments agreed well except for short distances downstream of the

vane.

Figure 2 illustrates the computational setup with the current setting consisting of a single VG on a flat plate. The actuator

is a rectangular vane with a length two times the VG height. The computational domain with dimensions normalized with

the VG height is also given in Figure 2, as also described more in detail in [25]. The thickness of the vane is constant and

the VG was positioned directly on the wall at a position where the boundary layer thickness is equal to the VG height. The

data were extracted in 5 spanwise planes, normal to the test section floor and located 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 VG heights

downstream of the vortex generator trailing edge.

The computational setup was designed to mimic the one of the experiments [18]. The VG angle of attack to the oncoming

flow is β = 20o and the Reynolds number based on VG height h = 0.25 m is Re = 1700, using an inflow velocity U∞=

1 ms−1 and a density of 1 kgm−3. At the bottom wall and on the VG surface no-slip conditions were specified, while

the upstream and lid part of the domain were specified as inflow conditions with prescribed velocity according to the

undisturbed velocity. The two side faces of the domain were specified as slip/symmetry conditions, while the downstream

plan was set as an outlet assuming fully developed flow. At the inlet the turbulence is set to give very low eddy viscosity,

and the turbulence seen by the VG is generated by the developing boundary layer along the wall surface.

In the experiments, the turbulence intensity at the inlet from laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements was

found to be 13% where the turbulence was generated by a grid at the inlet. The boundary layer thickness at the position

of the vortex generators was estimated from LDA measurements to be approximately δV G = 25 mm. The actuators

were rectangular vanes of the same height as the local boundary layer thickness, h = δV G, with a length of 2h. The

computations have been carried out based on the experimental inflow profile illustrated in Figure 3. This figure represents

the measured (Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocity) turbulent boundary layer profile without VG at the position where

the VG was later mounted. A more complete characterization of the inlet conditions can be found in the PhD thesis of

Velte [26].

The computational setup of the CFD simulations consists of a block structured mesh of 18 million cells with the first

cell height (Δz/h) of 1.5 × 10−6 normalized by the VG height. In the immediate vicinity of the vane, the mesh has

5 × 106 cells, while the mesh downstream the VG for capturing the wake has approximately 2.5 × 106 cells. In order to

resolve the boundary layer, cell clustering has been used close to the wall and the dimensionless distance from the wall is

Verification of sufficient mesh resolution was performed by a mesh dependency study. Results obtained for the finer

mesh Level 1 (66 blocks of 643 cells) are compared with results obtained for a standard Level 2 (66 blocks of 323 cells)

and a coarser mesh Level 3 (66 blocks of 163 cells). As grid stretching method, the hyperbolic tangent stretching function

of Vinokur [27] was used. Figure 4 illustrates the axial and azimuthal velocity profiles for three grid levels. These profiles

were extracted in a plane normal to the flow direction at five VG heights downstream of the vane and along a line parallel

to the wall passing through the center of the primary vortex. Mesh dependency of less than 6% has been detected for both

axial and azimuthal velocities. The simulations were converged until a satisfactory residual convergence was achieved on

the velocities, pressure and turbulence quantities.

3. RESULTS

The analysis of helical symmetry was performed on computational results extracted in the cross planes positioned at

z/h = 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 VG heights downstream of the trailing edge of the VG. The reason for the analysis not to be

performed at positions closer to the VG is that the wake in this range is still forming and therefore has not yet developed

the helical symmetry (see also [18, 26]). An angle of attack of β = 20o of the VG to the oncoming flow was chosen

for the computations and subsequently compared with the wind tunnel experiments and the analytical model in [18]. The

vane angle is close to the optimum found by Godard et al. [28] in a parametric study optimizing separation control. The

extraction of velocities from the computations was conducted in a similar way to the experimental procedure described in

Self-similarity and helical symmetry in VG flow simulations U. Fernández-Gámiz et al.

[5], in planes normal to the section wall downstream of the VG and applying polar coordinates (z, r, θ) to the vortex with

the origin at the vortex center.

3.1. Testing of helical symmetry

The first necessary step is to check whether the simulation results fulfill helical symmetry. In order to perform this test,

the three velocity components were extracted along lines passing through the center of the primary vortex at four angles

of Θ (0o, 45o, 90o and 135o) to cover the full rotational variations of the vortex, see Figure 5. The cylindrical coordinate

system used to describe these variations across the vortex core is presented in Figure 5, with the center always located at

the vortex core center. The origin of the z-axis is located at the upper edge of the VG trailing edge.

Figure 5. Polar coordinate system centered at the vortex core center.

The solid curves in Figure 6 illustrate the axial and azimuthal velocity profiles (upper curves are the axial velocity

profile uz and lower the azimuthal one uθ) for each plane position where the data is extracted along a horizontal line

through the vortex center. These curves are compared to what is obtained from the right-hand side of equation (1), finding

l by least squares fitting of the residual, see [18]. The two data sets overlap well for all plane positions, confirming that the

computational results fulfill the criterion for helical symmetry just like the experimental ones do. Note that the analysis

has been carried out only on the right side, due to a perturbing secondary vortex appearing on the left side yielding an

asymmetric velocity profile [5].

Figure 7 displays the stream-wise evolution of the helical parameters that directly result from this analysis: vortex

convection velocity (u0), circulation (Γ), helical pitch (l) and vortex core radius (ε) for the wind tunnel experiments and

computational simulations. The error bars illustrate the error of the linear fit to the data. The local flow characteristic u0

was found directly from the lowest value of the axial velocity wake profile in the vortex core and the helical pitch l was

obtained from least-squares fitting of equation (1). The circulation has been calculated from integration as the flux of

vorticity across a surface enclosed by a curve described by the vortex radius. The vortex core radius ε has been obtained

as the radius of the maximum value of the azimuthal velocity for each plane position. For a better comparison between

the experimental and computational results, both vortex radius and helical pitch have been normalized by the VG height

h and averaged across the azimuthal coordinate Θ. To illustrate the helical parameter dependency on theta, Figure 8 was

represented. This figure provides the CFD results of the evolution downstream of the VG for the helical pitch l and the

vortex core radius ε at different angles of Θ. The convection velocity has been normalized by the free stream-velocity

U∞ and the circulation by the product U∞ h. Since the axial and azimuthal velocities are observed to be self-similar, it is

expected that u0 and l also vary linearly along the downstream path, which is indeed observed for both the experiments and

the simulations in Figure 7. As expected, the only factor which does not vary along the plane positions is the circulation,

which should naturally be close to constant in a system of low viscous dissipation.

In fact, all helical parameters are seen to vary linearly with the downstream distance, both for experiments and

simulations. Further, the general trends agree in the downstream evolution of all parameters, though the absolute values

differ between the quantities. As pointed out earlier, the vortex strength is larger in the simulations and the vortex core

size is also somewhat larger and varies with a steeper gradient in the downstream direction. The normalized convection

velocity u0/U∞ (minimum axial velocity at the center of the vortex core divided by the free stream-velocity) in the

downstream direction was also observed to be smaller in the measurements for the positions closer to the VG, while in

the positions far away from the trailing edge of the VG it is larger in the measurements in comparison with the CFD

results, see Figure 7. This means that the axial velocity induction caused by the helical vorticity lines is stronger in

the measurements far away from the VG. The relation between the convection velocity and the helical pitch is not as

straightforward though, since the strength of the vorticity lines may vary.

3.2. Testing of wake self-similarity

Figures 9 display the axial (uz) and azimuthal (uθ) velocity profiles of the measurements (dash-dot lines) and

computational data (solid lines). The left column shows a combined plot of the axial and azimuthal velocity profiles

for all downstream positions. The mid and right columns show the self-similarity scaled axial and azimuthal velocity

profiles, respectively. In the case of the computations, the velocity profiles have been represented at the plane positions

z/h = 5 − 15, while the experimental profiles have been represented at z/h = 5 − 13, according with [18]. Note that

these profiles all collapse nicely except on the left side of these profiles, in particular for the axial velocity, where the

secondary vortex perturbation appears.

From visual inspection of the left column in Figure 9, it becomes apparent that the axial and azimuthal velocity profiles in

the vortex core do not change significantly for the various angles Θ. Of course, the presence of the wall and the emergence

of the perturbing secondary structure create distortions in the outer regions of the core, which is particularly observable on

the left side of the plots for Θ = 45◦, 90◦ and 135◦. The computational results follow the same trend of the experiments,

though some features are pronounced to greater or lesser extent. The effects of the secondary perturbing vortex are more

clearly visible on the left side of the axial velocity profiles of the experimental results for Θ = 0◦. Moreover, the speed-up

in the azimuthal velocity close to the wall for Θ = 90◦ is larger in the experiments compared to the computational profiles,

which is consistent with the stronger induction further downstream. These anomalies can be attributed to the vortex core

strength being larger in the computations, see Figure 7, and the vortex core distance to the wall being smaller in the wind

tunnel experiments. More specifically, the distance from the center of the vortex to the wall in the case of the computations

corresponds to 0.84 times the VG height, measured in a plane perpendicular to the wall and five times the device height

downstream of the VG. While in the experiments, it was observed that the distance from the center of the vortex to the wall

at the same downstream position is only 0.72 times the VG height. The last effect can also be attributed to the vortex core

size being larger in the simulations, see Figures 7. A stronger primary vortex positioned closer to the wall will naturally

cause stronger swirl velocities and a larger spanwise adverse pressure gradient at the wall, causing the separation (i.e.,

secondary vortex core) to increase in strength, hence increasing the perturbations on the primary vortex. Further, some

general differences between the measured and the computed velocity profiles are observed. The axial velocity induction

is not as pronounced in the computations as in the measurements. This is apparent from the smaller deficit in the wake

profiles of the computations in comparison to the measured ones, see left column of Figure 9. The swirl velocities are

also generally observed to be smaller in the computed flow. Secondly, the vortex core size (distance between the extreme

swirl velocities in the right column of Figure 9) varies more than in the measurements. The vortex core is also larger in the

computations than in the measurements, as can be seen by comparing the azimuthal profiles in the left column of Figure 9.

4. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Though the simulations are not perfectly able to mimic the measured flow, the general trends in the flow are captured and

the simulations are able to reproduce both the helical symmetry (linear relation between the axial and azimuthal flow) as

well as the self-similar behavior in the mean velocity profiles. The helical symmetry of the main vortex generated by a

rectangular VG on a test section wall has been tested and compared with the analytical model developed in [5] with good

agreement. Self-similarity behavior has also been confirmed in the computations in several positions downstream of the

VG. According to Figure 9, both axial and azimuthal velocity profiles collapse for every angle Θ = 0o, 45o, 90o and 135o

so that the full 3D flow is covered. The computational profiles show a qualitative agreement with the experiments in the

basic physical flow response of the VG wake, thought differences are more visible on the azimuthal velocities. Furthermore,

as a quantitative comparison, four characteristic vortex parameters have been analyzed: convection velocity, circulation,

helical pitch and vortex core radius, see Figure 7. The trends of these parameters of the computational simulations are in

line with the ones shown in the experiments. However, some discrepancies are visible in the values of these parameters.

The computations overpredict the circulation and the vortex core radius, while the helical pitch is underpredicted. These

discrepancies could be explained by the assumption of isotropy of the eddy viscosity models, causing problems in

predicting the behavior of rotating flows. As the inflow in the simulations is assumed steady, all unsteadiness present in

the actual experiment is neglected in the mean flow, and must be accounted for through the turbulent eddy-viscosity. The

turbulence models are designed to simulate turbulent variations in the flow, and therefore may have troubles simulating

the large-scale flow variations of the primary as well as the secondary vortices. This can explain why the convection

velocity growth rate along the streamwise direction is significantly weaker in the simulations than in the experiments.

As represented in Figure 7(a), in the measurement plane positions closer to the VG the computations overpredict the

convection velocity, however, due to a higher slope of the convection velocity evolution in the experimental results, it is

underpredicted in the positions far from the VG. This will naturally also affect the numerically obtained vortex core radius,

circulation and helical pitch. In addition to the inlet conditions not being perfectly reproduced in the simulations, the

limitations in existing turbulence model in correctly predicting such highly complex flows as the present example cannot

be ignored. The flow contains strong pressure gradients in many directions with cases of separation (e.g. the secondary

vortex), which are known to be notoriously difficult for the turbulence models to handle. Nevertheless, the simulations can

capture the main trends of this complex, highly 3D flow once these constants are found and therefore the reduced analytical

model obtained from the experiments is especially valuable for these types of simulations since knowledge of the flow at

one single downstream position from experiments can be used to validate the numerical simulations throughout the entire

developed VG wake.

It is important to evaluate the performance of CFD methods for these types of flows, since these are, by far, the most

commonly used in practice for this type of problem. The importance of well designed VG configurations for the total wind

turbine performance and their up-scaling is emphasized by the studies of Øye [13] and Miller [14]. We have in the present

U. Fernández-Gámiz et al. Self-similarity and helical symmetry in VG flow simulations

5. CONCLUSIONS

Vortices generated by a passive rectangular vane-type vortex generator of the same height as the local boundary layer

thickness above a test section wall have been studied. CFD simulations at Reynolds number Re = 1700 based on the VG

height h = 0.25 m and free stream velocity U∞= 1 ms
−1 have been carried out using the RANS method and compared

with wind tunnel experimental data and an analytical model.

The vortex generated by the VG shows self-similar behaviour for both the axial and azimuthal velocity profiles. It

has been proven based on the computer simulated data from five cross-plane positions z/h = 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15

downstream of the trailing edge of a VG with an angle of attack β = 20◦ to the oncoming flow, just as in the experiments.

The computational results show relatively good agreement with the self-similarity shown in the experiments,both displayed

in Figure 9, and also present in [18]. The trends of the characteristic helical vortex parameters in the computational results

match the experimental observations reasonably well (Figure 7) considering the limitations of the turbulence models for

reproducing the embedded vortices produced by vane-type VGs and the applied inlet conditions.

From the point of view of self-similarity, computational simulations are able to reproduce the physics of the vortex

generated by a rectangular VG with reasonably good reliability. Furthermore, the helical symmetry has been also tested

and verified based on the computational data.

As CFD methods are the most common ones applied in optimizing VGs on wind turbine blades, the detailed information

provided by the investigations of the present study can be used as a guidance for successful implementation of VGs on a

wind turbine blade and to investigate parametric dependencies of the VGs on different boundary layers. Due to the vast

range of parameters inherent in the problem (angle, interspacing, orientation, VG height and length etc.) an exhaustive

understanding of the flow is required to be applied properly, in which the application of this simplifying model can be

helpful. Note that the current model applied can describe the complete flow characteristics of the VG wake (except for the

viscous wall/secondary structures interactions) in a physical fashion and facilitates the validation of computational results.

To the knowledge of the authors, this kind of comparison has previously only been done in a qualitative fashion or only

quantitatively to some extent, i.e., only covering some aspects of the VG induced wake.

CFD velocity profiles of embedded vortices generated by a VG for a device angle $\beta=20^o$ and $\Theta 
= 0^o$. The negative $r/h$ values represent the $r/h$ axis for $\Theta = 180^o$. Upper values are the 
axial velocity profile $u_z$ and lower the azimuthal one $u_\theta$ normalized by $U_{\infty}$. For 

positive $r/h$, CFD values of $u_z$  are compared to the right-hand side of equation (\ref{eqn1}) 
calculated using the computational values $u_0$ and $u_\theta$ (o).

CFD (solid lines) and experimental (dash-dot lines) velocity profiles for various angles $\Theta$  at different 
plane positions downstream of the VG. The left side shows the axial ($u_z$) and azimuthal ($u_\theta$) 
profiles and the middle and right sides show the axial and azimuthal profiles respectively, scaled by self-

similarity variables.
