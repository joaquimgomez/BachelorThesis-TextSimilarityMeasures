Abstract. Submerged structures that operate under extreme flows are prone to suffer large 
scale cavitation attached to their surfaces. Under such conditions the added mass effects differ 
from the expected ones in pure liquids. Moreover, the existence of small gaps between the 
structure and surrounding bodies filled with fluid also influence the dynamic response. A series 
of experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out with a truncated NACA0009 
hydrofoil mounted as a cantilever beam at the LMH-EPFL cavitation tunnel. The three first 
modes of vibration have been determined and analysed under various hydrodynamic conditions 
ranging from air and still water to partial cavitation and supercavitation. A remote non-
intrusive excitation system with piezoelectric patches has been used for the experiments. The 
effects of the cavity properties and the lateral gap size on the natural frequencies and mode 
shapes have been determined. As a result, the significance of several parameters in the design 
of such structures is discussed. 

1.  Introduction 
The current interest among structural designers lies in seeking the limits of new materials or new 
structural configurations that offer improved and suitable qualities to create thinner, lighter and more 
flexible structures. At the same time, the concentration of power and the off-design operation of fluid 
machinery results in an increase of the unsteady hydrodynamic loads and the appearance of fluid 
instabilities. This general trend leads to more frequent material fatigue or resonance failures due to 
undesirable flow induced vibrations. 

In this sense, a deep understanding of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of submerged bodies is 
fundamental for the design of a large variety of systems. This problem, although not new, has 
undergone a recent growth in popularity due to the large number of applications for fluids. In brief, the 
structural response of a submerged body depends significantly on its boundary conditions. However, 
the actual hydrodynamic conditions are often uncertain and it is difficult to determine them because 
the in-situ environment is not accessible for observation or measurement. 

As a first approach, it is well known that a body in a dense and still fluid exhibits a different 
dynamic behavior than when surrounded by air due to the so-called “added mass effect” that is mainly 
translated to a reduction of the natural frequencies [1-4]. If the fluid flows around the body, additional 
uncertainties appear with a possible influence on the total damping and stiffness [5-6]. For example, 
the proximity of solid boundaries create small gaps filled with fluid that affect significantly the

dynamic response [7-8]. And certainly, the presence of a two-phase flow due to hydrodynamic 
cavitation will add new boundary conditions that are not fully understood yet. 

From a structural point of view, the interest in cavitation stems from the fact that many submerged 
bodies suffer from this phenomenon or they are prone to suffer it. The mixture of liquid and vapor 
water phases that forms the macroscopic hydrodynamic cavities can create averaged properties that 
vary from the expected effects of a pure liquid. Moreover, the complex structure and morphology of 
the two-phase flow enhances its scientific interest and opens new challenges to the design of 
submerged structures [9]. Consequently, evidence obtained from experiments and numerical 
simulations is summarized in the current paper to illustrate the significant parameters to take into 
account in such cases. 

2.  Experimental set-up 
A series of experimental modal analysis were performed on an aluminum NACA0009 hydrofoil at the 
High Speed Cavitation Tunnel of the Laboratory for Hydraulic Machines (LMH-EPFL). A couple of 
Plumbum (lead) Zirconate Titanate (PZT) patches made of piezoelectric ceramic material were used as 
excitation and measuring systems perfectly embedded on the surface to avoid affecting the flow 
around the profile. The patch closer to the leading edge was used as exciter and the other one closer to 
the leading edge was used as sensor. 

To measure structural vibration velocities, a single point Laser Doppler Vibrometer was used 
which is based on the “Doppler effect”. Additional transducers consisted of two IEPE accelerometers, 
a force transducer and an instrumented hammer with a steel tip. For signal acquisition, recording and 
analyzing a sweep signal function generator, an analog to digital (A/D) converter with simultaneous 
channel sampling and a Fourier analyzer system were used. 

The dynamic response of profile was studied under different flow conditions including leading 
edge attached sheet cavitation and supercavitation. Before filling the tunnel, a modal analysis was 
performed to obtain the reference natural frequencies (“Air” condition). Then, with the tunnel full of 
still water, the “Still water” conditions were also obtained. Finally, the “Cavitation” conditions were 
selected to ensure a series of stable attached cavities as shown on the left of Figure 1. The cavity 
lengths were varied from 2 to 75 % of the chord at 14 m/s free stream velocity and for two incidence 
angles of 1 and 2. 

3.  Numerical model 
A NACA0009 hydrofoil mounted inside the tunnel test section submerged with water was modelled 
with a FEM solver. A coupled Structural – Acoustic analysis was used to simulate the dynamic 
behaviour of the system. A sensibility analysis of the solid domain mesh was performed to determine 
its optimal size. Regarding the fluid domain, the dimensions were also selected to ensure that the 
lateral walls considered as fully reflective did not influence the numerical solution. Moreover, special 
attention was given to the small lateral gap between the hydrofoil tip section and the tunnel wall that 
has a size of approximately 0.12 mm as drawn in the centre of Figure 1. The final model can be seen 
on the right of Figure 1.

4.  Results and discussion 
To quantify the effects of various parameters on the modal behaviour of the hydrofoil, both the added 
mass coefficient, CM, and the mode shapes have been determined and analysed. The CM is defined by 
Equation (1) where fvacuum and ffluid correspond to the natural frequencies for the hydrofoil surrounded 
by air and by water or cavitation, respectively. 

1    (1) 

To characterize the attached cavity dimensions the CSR defined by Equation (2) has been used 
where l is the cavity length and c is the hydrofoil chord. 

     (2) 
In particular, the three first modes of vibration named f1, f2 and f3 corresponding to the first 

bending, the first torsion and the second bending ones, respectively, have been identified and 
considered for the studies. 

4.1.  Cavity properties 
As observed on Figure 2, the added mass effects depend on the particular mode shape. They are 
maximum for f1 and minimum for f2. The CSR obviously determines the effect but no linear 
relationship is found with CM because other factors also influence the result. On the contrary, for the 
two angles of attack similar results are obtained. 

A detailed analysis of the cavity morphology and dimensions [9] has demonstrated that a linear 
correlation can be found between CM and the so-called entrained mass which accounts for the average 
density of the cavity, the hydrofoil surface covered by the cavity and its relative displacement induced 
by the mode of vibration. Therefore, for an accurate prediction of the added mass effects under 
cavitation conditions, these variables must be taken into account which is not an easy task. In 
particular, it is necessity to improve the experimental and numerical tools to quantify the void ratio of 
the cavities.

without cavitation (b). 

4.2.  Lateral gap 
A significant effect has been identified that is provoked by the narrow gap between the structure and 
the solid boundary. In our case, the experimental and numerical results plotted on the right of Figure 2 
clearly show how the added mass effects increase following a quadratic law when the gap distance is 
reduced. This behaviour is observed in all the modes and the effect increases with mode order. 

4.3.  Mode shapes 
Finally, a relevant mode shape alteration has been clearly measured regarding mainly the second 
bending mode, f3, under cavitation conditions in comparison with the reference mode shape in air as

shown in Figure 3. As observed, under partial cavitation the new mode loses the symmetry and it 
resembles a more complex bending-torsion coupled mode. The different properties of the fluids 
surrounding the hydrofoil -water and vapor-, their location and their size appear as the main factors 
determining the mode shape alteration.

experimentally in air (a) and with attached partial cavitation (b). 

5.  Conclusions 
The design of submerged structures that are prone to suffer macroscopic cavities attached to their 
surfaces requires the consideration of several parameters that have a significant effect on their 
dynamic response. The experimental and numerical studies demonstrate that the average properties of 
the cavity, the cavity size and the cavity location have a relevant effect on the added mass coefficients 
depending on the particular mode shape under consideration. Moreover, the existence of narrow gaps 
between the structure and the solid boundaries also has a significant influence on the overall 
behaviour. And finally, it must be noted that the new mode shapes might differ from the predicted 
ones in air conditions.
