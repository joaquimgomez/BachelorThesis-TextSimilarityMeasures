Abstract. Studying the dynamic response of Francis turbine runners is of paramount 

importance in order to avoid resonance problems during operating conditions. For this purpose, 

the natural frequencies as well as their associated mode-shapes and damping ratios of the 

runner have to be determined. In this paper, an Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) of the 

runner of a Francis turbine prototype has been performed. By means of this experimental 

technique, natural frequencies, mode-shapes and damping ratios have been estimated in air. 

Results obtained have been compared with a Finite Element Method (FEM) model in order to 

check the accuracy of the simulation.   

1.  Introduction 

The structural dynamic response of Francis turbines has to be studied during the stage of design of the 

machine in order to avoid resonance and fatigue problems during operating conditions [1, 2]. One of 

the components that could be strongly affected by fatigue problems is the runner. The runner is a 

rotating structure submerged and confined in water with small gaps to the stationary parts. The effect 

of the water and the confinement on the natural frequencies of the runner is well-known and it is 

demonstrated with the added mass theory [3-5]. This added mass effect could be accurately estimated 

by using acoustical-numerical Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations [5-8]. However, the 

damping factor associated to each natural frequency and mode-shape plays also an important role on 

the dynamic response of structures, since it is the mechanism of the structure to dissipate energy due to 

inertia and elastic forces.  

The damping ratio associated to each natural frequency and mode-shape can be understood as a 

sum of the material damping ratio and the hydrodynamic damping ratio or added damping due to the 

surrounding water [3, 9, 10]. This hydrodynamic damping has been demonstrated to be higher when 

the submerged structure is near a rigid wall [3, 10] and even higher when the surrounding water flows 

through the submerged structure [9]. The estimation of this damping ratio using simulation is difficult 

and challenging and therefore experimental results are usually necessary. 

The mode-shapes associated to each natural frequency of the structure has to be also studied in 

detail to understand the dynamic response of the machine under operating conditions. In case of 

resonance during operation, not only the frequency of the excitation has to coincide with a natural 

frequency of the runner, but also the shape of the excitation has to match with the mode-shape of the 

natural frequency [11]. According to many studies, confining the structure in still water does not 

change its mode-shapes [3, 5]. However, when the runner rotates in water every mode-shape became

into two travelling waves rotating in the same and in the opposite direction than the runner but 

maintaining the same shape than without rotation [12]. 

In this paper, an Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) of a medium-head Francis turbine has been 

carried out. The Francis turbine selected for the study is located in British Columbia, Canada, and it 

has 444 MW of rated power. The study of the dynamic response of this prototype is included in the 

research carried out in the Hyperbole project. Natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode-shapes of 

the runner in air have been determined and compared with simulation results. 

2.  Experiment 

Taking profit of an outage of the prototype in 2016, an EMA could be performed in the runner. The 

runner was accessible from the draft tube mandoor as well as from the spiral casing. Impacts were 

carried out with an instrumented hammer (Dytran 5802A, sensitivity 220 uV/N) in different points of 

the runner and the response was measured with accelerometers located always in the same point. This 

method is called rowing hammer method. The runner was impacted at 16 different equidistant points 

in the band outlet and in every blade outlet. One accelerometer (Kistler 8750A50, sensitivity 100 

mV/g) was located in the band outlet and another two in the crown and band inlet (see Figure 1). 

 

 
Figure 1. Instrumentation and impacts location. 

Five impacts were always done in every point to use their average during the analysis. An 

exponential window (τ=400 ms) was applied to the accelerometers time signal and a transient window 
(100ms) to the hammer signal for the FRF (Frequency Response Function) computation. Coherence 

between the accelerometers signals and the hammer was computed always to ensure that the response 

is due to the impact. Figure 2 shows and example of one FRF computed at the same time than the 

coherence. It is seen that for all the peaks found in the FRF, which are the natural frequencies of the 

runner, the coherence is maximum.

This procedure was repeated for all the different points (32) where the runner was impacted. To 

know how the mode-shapes of the structure are, all these points were assigned to a simplified structure 

which represents the runner performing ODS (Operation Deflection Shape). Natural frequencies and 

damping ratios were extracted for every mode using Complex Mode Indicators Functions (CMIF) of 

the commercial software Pulse® Reflex [13]. 

3.  Numerical model 

The numerical model considered the runner, the shaft and the generator. However, as only impacts in 

the runner were done experimentally, only the runner mode-shapes are shown in this paper. The 

details of the optimal mesh and the different parameters fixed in the FEM simulation were previously 

published in [14]. The FEM simulation was solved using the commercial code Ansys® v16.2. In this 

case, the surrounding water of the turbine is not considered in order to compare the simulation with the 

experimental case. Moreover, this simulation does not consider any damping in the numerical model, 

therefore this parameter will not be compared with experimental results. 

4.  Results 

As a first view, comparing the response of different points of the runner (band inlet, band outlet and 

blades outlet, Figure 3), it is clearly seen that the response of the band and the blades at the outlet is 

rather higher than the response in the inlet. This means that maximum displacement of the mode-

shapes is basically concentrated in the band and blades outlet.

in different points (Green=response in the band inlet, Blue=response in the blade outlet, red=response 

in the band outlet). 

The mode-shapes of Francis turbine runners are normally classified by the number of nodal 

diameters (iND) [14], but these different mode-shapes with different number of nodal diameters have 

also another common characteristics that can be used to recognise them. Figure 4 shows which are 

these common characteristics between the mode-shapes of the Francis turbine of study. There is a first 

zone in frequency (from 0 to 160 Hz) where the amplitude of the band and blades outlet is the same, 

these modes have been named as Global Modes (G). However, from 160 Hz onwards, the blade 

deformation is higher than the band deformation and therefore these modes have been named as Blade 

Dominant (BlD) modes. Moreover, analysing the deformation and the phases of two consecutive 

blades (Blades number 15 and 16), there are some modes where both are in phase (IPh), and another in 

counter phase (CPh) (as seen in Figure 4). Therefore, different combinations of nodal diameters (iND), 

Global Modes or BlD, or IPh or CPh modes can be found for this Francis turbine runner.

5.  Conclusions 

Natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode-shapes of a Francis turbine runner have been obtained 

by means of an Experimental Modal Analysis. The runner was impacted in 32 different points and the 

response was measured with accelerometers in different positions. After the FRF computation an ODS 

analysis was performed and the mode-shapes, natural frequencies and damping ratios were obtained. 

These results have been compared with simulation having a good agreement. 

This experimental analysis validates the numerical simulation and therefore the numerical model 

can be used to obtain the natural frequencies when the runner is surrounded by water.
