ABSTRACT 
 
Cavitation appearance within the runner of the water turbines is a common problem that induces vibrations and provokes the 
erosion of the blades. Although many investigations have been carried out in simple configurations such as 2D and 3D hydrofoils 
in cavitation tunnels, few works have been done to simulate the cavitation dynamic behavior in actual turbine geometries. In 
this paper, the unsteady numerical simulation of suction side leading edge cavitation has been carried out for the GAMM Francis 
runner. For that, the two-phase model available in ANSYS CFX and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model have 
been used. A sensitivity analysis of various model parameters has been done and the results have been validated with 
experimental values obtained in a reduced scale model test utility at the best efficiency point. Special attention has been given 
to determine if a shedding process also exists and to understand the main hydrodynamic mechanisms involved. In conclusion, 
the instability of the leading edge cavitation seems to be mainly caused by field pressure perturbations originating from the 
guide vanes or the draft tube. 
 
KEY WORDS: Francis turbine, inlet blade cavitation, unsteady flow simulation, Zwart cavitation model. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Cavitation is a common event that occurs in hydraulic machinery, which can lead to loss of performance, lower 
efficiency, vibrations and noise. Nowadays, the operating range of the turbines must be increased and more 
operation at off-design conditions is being requested. As a result, cavitation phenomena and their negative 
consequences are enhanced, which represents a potential threat for the hydropower plants. In fact, Francis turbines 
are the most common type of reaction machines in the power generation system. In addition, there are several 
cavitation patterns that can appear in the Francis turbine blades according to their location and morphology: (i) inlet 
leading edge cavitation; (ii) inter-blade vortex cavitation; and (iii) outlet traveling bubble cavitation [1]. 
 
To understand the fluid mechanic behavior of cavitation in the blades of a Francis turbine, numerical computations 
have been carried out using turbulence models coupled with homogeneous two-phase mixture models. The most 
popular mass transfer models are those developed by Kunz [2], Zwart [3] and Singhal [4]. The two latter models 
are both based on the simplified Rayleigh-Plesset equation of spherical bubble dynamics in an incompressible liquid, 
meanwhile the Kunz model is derived from Ginzburg-Landu theory. Among the various studies found on the 
numerical prediction of cavitation in Francis turbines, inter-blade vortex cavitation has been successfully captured 
with the unsteady RANS simulation with the SST-SAS turbulence model and the Zwart cavitation model [5]. 
 
There have been many attempts to investigate the flow structure and behavior of inlet blade cavitation in Francis 
turbines. For example, Avellan et al. [6] visualized the cavitation developments inside the medium-high specific 
speed GAMM Francis turbine runner for different Thoma´s numbers. Based on these experimental results, Susan-
Resiga et al. [7] and Escaler et al. [8] have carried out steady state numerical simulations that have predicted with 
good accuracy the cavitation shape and position in comparison with the experimental results. 
 
In the present study, the unsteady simulation of the GAMM Francis turbine has been carried using the URANS 
turbulence model SST together with the Zwart cavitation model. Besides the best efficiency point (BEP), two other 
off-design operating conditions have also been taken into consideration to evaluate the leading edge cavitation 
unsteady behavior. Then, particular attention has been given to investigate the effect of flow perturbations at the

inlet and outlet of the runner only for the BEP. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND NUMERICAL SETUP 
 
The runner geometry used in the present work corresponds to a Francis turbine model tested by the Laboratory of 
Hydraulic Machinery from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), which was the test case of the 
GAMM Workshop on 3D Computation of Incompressible Internal Flows carried out in 1989. The model consisted 
of 24 stay vanes, 24 guide vanes and 13 blades, however, only the fluid domain around the runner without the 
distributor has been considered in our investigation. The domain inlet radius and width are 289 mm and 120 mm, 
respectively. To achieve a better numerical convergence, the draft tube outlet cone has been extended a length of 
400 mm. The hill chart of GAMM Francis turbine has been obtained from the experiment data [6]. To simulate the 
characteristics of the leading edge cavitation in the turbine, three operation points corresponding to best efficiency 
point (BEP), part load and full load have been chosen. The corresponding performance parameters are listed in 
Table 1, where 𝑄𝑄 is the turbine volumetric flow rate, 𝛺𝛺 = 52.36 rad/s is the runner rotation speed, 𝑅𝑅ref = 0.2 m is 
the reference radius of the runner, 𝐸𝐸 is the specific hydraulic energy, 𝑇𝑇 is the runner torque and 𝜂𝜂 is the efficiency.

The SST turbulence model together with the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation model have been selected to simulate 
the unsteady flow field around the blades. The SST turbulence model has been treated near the wall using the 
automatic wall function proposed by Menter [9], which is the smooth blend of the linear and logarithm wall function. 
The treatment of the dissipation frequency, 𝜔𝜔, has been addressed with the following Equations 1 to 4:

where y is the wall normal distance of the first mesh grid and U1 is the grid velocity. 𝑢𝑢𝜏𝜏 is the friction velocity and

respectively.  
 
Besides the SST turbulence model and its near wall treatment, the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation mass transfer 
model has been used to compute �̇�𝑚, as indicated in Equation 5:

where 𝐹𝐹𝑉𝑉and 𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶 are the empirical coefficients of vaporization and condensation, respectively, 𝑟𝑟nuc is the nucleation

default values, i.e, 𝐹𝐹𝑉𝑉 = 50, 𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶 = 0.01, 𝑟𝑟nuc = 5 ∙ 10−4 and 𝑅𝑅𝐵𝐵 = 2 ∙ 10−6m. The rest of the variables in Equation

3169 Pa. 
 
The inlet fluid domain has been defined as a Dirichlet boundary condition with specific velocity components in a 
cylindrical coordinate system corresponding Uu (tangential), Ur (radial) and Uz (axial). In particular, the inlet Uz has 
been set to zero and the Ur and Uz have been derived from the inlet velocity triangle with the assumption that the 
flow angle is equal to the guide vane angle. Based on this, the velocity components under different operating points 
have been calculated and they are listed in Table 2. 
 
The fluid domain outlet boundary has been set as an opening and the entrainment pressure, 𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜, has been fixed 
with a value calculated using the Thoma’s cavitation number [10] expressed with Equation 6:

where 𝐸𝐸 is the output power of the turbine, which can be deduced from the turbine efficiency plotted in the hill 
chart. In order to compare the cavitation unsteady flow behavior under different operation conditions, we have kept 
σ constant and equal to 0.14.

MODEL VALIDATION 
 
Menter et al. [9] investigated the influence of using different 𝑦𝑦+ values with the SST turbulence model because it 
uses the blending wall function, and they found that the SST model is not very sensitive to the mesh size. However, 
recent studies focused on two-phase flows carried out by Decaix [11] and Picardi et al. [12] have found that the 
mesh grid resolution may have a significant influence on the simulation results. Therefore, we have conducted some 
tests to evaluate the effects of the grid refinement and element density in our results.  
 
The steady state no cavitation results simulated with different meshes in terms of number of elements and 𝑦𝑦+ values 
have been compared for the BEP condition. All the meshes have been generated using the ANSYS Turbogrid tool 
with a similar increase ratio around 2.8. Because only a single runner channel has been considered in the fluid 
domain, the coarsest mesh only consisted of around 127,000 hexahedrons with higher refinement in both the blade 
and the shroud walls, as shown in Figure 1a. Among the six meshes shown in Figure 1, those corresponding to (a), 
(b) and (c) have 𝑦𝑦+ values above 11.35 and, therefore, the first grid point is located within the logarithm boundary 
layer. Meanwhile, for meshes corresponding to (d), (e) and (f), the 𝑦𝑦+ values are below 1 and, therefore, the first 
grid point is located within the viscous sublayer.

The torque values calculated with the various meshes at BEP are summarized in the Table 3. All of them present a 
good level of accuracy compared to the experimental value of 388 N m. A local analysis of the mesh influence has 
been carried out comparing the numerical velocity profiles at the runner inlet with the measured ones as shown in 

(a) (c) (d) (e) (f) (b)

RESULTS WITH UNIFORM AND STEADY FLOW CONDITIONS 
 
To carry out the unsteady RANS simulation of the cavitation, the Reboud’s density correction for the eddy viscosity 
[13] has been implemented on the ANSYS CFX platform. Besides, the numerical settings for the unsteady 
calculation have been the following ones: 
 

- a time step of 10-4 s, that results in a maximum Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) value equal to 5 at BEP,  
 

- 50 loop iterations and a convergence level of 10-6.

The unsteady calculation results have been summarized in Table 4 for different discharges. In all the cases, the 
pressure near the aft region of the cavity is kept almost constant, as well as the cavity length and shape. No obvious 
cavitation instabilities occur in any of the operating points. These results seem indicate that, without considering 
internal flow perturbations inside the fluid domain or at the boundaries, the inlet leading edge cavitation is a rather 
stable cavitation structure inside a Francis runner operating at BEP or at lower or higher flow rate.

RESULTS WITH FLOW PERTURBATIONS 
 
Although the leading edge cavitation in Francis turbine appears to have stable behavior under uniform and steady 
flow conditions inside the runner, the actual flow will present various types of flow perturbations, which might force 
a significant cavity oscillation or shedding process. The two main flow perturbation inside the runner are caused 
by: (i) the rotor stator interaction at the gap between the guide vanes and the runner blades; and (ii) the draft tube 
vortex rope [14]. 
 
A mathematical expression, as indicated in Equation 7, has been used to model the perturbation at the runner inlet 
velocity distribution induced by the guide vanes’ wakes as outlined in Figure 4: 
 

𝑉𝑉�⃗ (𝜃𝜃, 𝑡𝑡) = 𝐶𝐶(1 + 𝐴𝐴cos(2𝛺𝛺𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 + 2𝛺𝛺𝜃𝜃/𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠))                                                         (7) 
 
where 𝑉𝑉�⃗ (𝜃𝜃, 𝑡𝑡) is the absolute velocity distribution at the runner inlet, 𝐶𝐶 = (1.94, 4.39, 0) is the uniform absolute 
velocity in cylindrical coordinates at the runner inlet at BEP, A is the perturbation level of the velocity distribution, 
which is specified equal to 0.5, 𝑓𝑓𝑟𝑟 is the guide vane passing frequency, 2𝛺𝛺𝜃𝜃/𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 is the inter blade phase difference, 
and 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 is the angle between two guide vanes. This velocity distribution is a simplification of the real one observed 
in the runner and it neglects the runner cascade influence and the dynamic effects [14]. 
 

 
Figure 4: Velocity distribution at the runner inlet induced by the RSI. 

 
In presence of the draft tube, there is a vortex rope that develops at loads above or below the BEP. The vortex rope 
is induced by the residual tangential velocity component in the draft tube. At part load, the vortex rope may provoke 
a low frequency pressure fluctuation at the outlet of the runner. This frequency is called the Rheingans [15] 
frequency, 𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑅 , that is proportional to the rotation frequency, 𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁, and that typically ranges from 𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁/3.6 to 𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁/3. 



 
 

3rd International Symposium of Cavitation and Multiphase Flow 

Therefore, in our case the pressure fluctuation is considered to develop at a frequency of 2.5Hz and its amplitude is 
considered to be the 10% of 𝑃𝑃out. Therefore, to predict the behavior of the leading edge cavitation when the vortex 
rope exists, an oscillatory pressure signal has been set at the outlet boundary of the fluid domain as defined with the 
following expression 𝑃𝑃out = 11326 (1 + 0.1 ∙ sin(2π𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡)). 
 
The work of Tsujimoto et al. [16] predicts that two types of cavitation instabilities can occur in Francis turbines 
corresponding to the following models: 
 

- model 1: the height of the attached cavitation sheet becomes unstable due to a high frequency perturbation, 
- model 2: the length of the attached cavitation sheet becomes unstable due to a low frequency perturbation. 

 
A sketch of the two different types of cavitation instability is shown in Figure 5. 
 

        
(a) Model 1                                                                  (b) Model 2 

Figure 5: Instabilities of the attached cavitation sheet induced by external perturbations of high (a) and low (b) frequency as predicted 
by Tsujimoto et al. [16]. 

 
The evolution in time of the leading edge cavitation vapor volume fraction on the suction side of the runner blade 
at a span of 0.95 is presented in Figure 6. When the wake of the guide vanes disturbs the inlet flow to the runner 
blades and generates a high frequency perturbation, the cavity length remains constant meanwhile the chord wise 
cavity height fluctuates. This behavior shown in Figure 6a would correspond to the model 2 instability. When the 
pressure frequency fluctuates at the outlet boundary due to the vortex rope, the cavity length fluctuates meanwhile 
the chord wise cavity height remains constant. This behavior shown in Figure 6b would correspond to the model 1 
instability.

3rd International Symposium of Cavitation and Multiphase Flow 

These two cavitation instabilities can be described with a simple 1D model [17] that assumes a vapor cavity in a 
duct of a given section 𝐴𝐴 and inlet length 𝐿𝐿 and of infinite outlet length. From the mass and momentum conservation 
equations, the relationship between the pressure, 𝑝𝑝, and the cavity volume, 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐, is given by Equation 7: 
 

𝐴𝐴
𝜌𝜌𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿

𝑝𝑝 =   𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐  ̈                                                                                (7) 
 
Given a pressure fluctuation with frequency 𝑓𝑓 defined by 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖2𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝑜𝑜, then Equation 7 can be solved and Equation 
8 is obtained: 
 

𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐 = 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐0 −
1

(𝜆𝜆2𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋)2
𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖2𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝑜𝑜 ∙ ( 𝐴𝐴

𝜌𝜌𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
)                                                               (8) 

 
where the 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐0 is initial cavity volume , and the second term in the expression is the fluctuation of the cavity volume. 
 
According to Equation 8, the amplitude of the cavity volume fluctuation is proportional to 1 𝑓𝑓2⁄ . Therefore, for 
large values of 𝜆𝜆 such as in the case of the high frequency inlet pressure fluctuation, induced by the inlet velocity 
distribution, the cavity volume fluctuation will be small. This result can be confirmed in Figure 7 where the 
dimensionless cavity length has been plotted as a function of the fluctuation period, T, for the 200 Hz inlet 
perturbation. It can be seen that the cavity length is constant and the unstable behavior only affects the lateral surface 
of the cavity, which corresponds to model 1. However, for the 2.5 Hz pressure perturbation corresponding to a low 
values of 𝜆𝜆, the cavity volume fluctuation amplitude is significant and leads to an obvious perturbation of the cavity 
length, which corresponds to model 2.

CONCLUSION 
 
First, steady simulations of the leading edge suction side cavitation in the GAMM Francis turbine blades have been 
carried out with the SST turbulence model and the Zwart cavitation mass transfer model using various meshes. It 
has been confirmed that the results are not sensitive to the mesh resolution for the cases considered in our study. 
 
Then, unsteady simulations with uniform boundary conditions in terms of inlet velocity and outlet pressure have 
demonstrated that the attached partial cavity behaves as a stable structure without any significant fluctuation at three 
different operating conditions including BEP, part load and high load. 
 
Finally, the effects of flow perturbations on the cavitation dynamic behavior have been evaluated at BEP. On one 
hand, it has been found that a high frequency inlet velocity fluctuation, as that induced by the guide vanes outlet 
flow, provokes an instability of the cavity surface. On the other hand, a low frequency outlet pressure fluctuation, 
as that induced by the rotating vortex rope, provokes an instability of the cavity length.  
 
As a future work, the fluid domain comprising the runner will be enlarged to take into account the stay vanes, the 
guide vanes and the draft tube cone using the transient blade row modelling approach in order to verify the present
