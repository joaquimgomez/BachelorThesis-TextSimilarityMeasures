Abstract.
The present study deals with the numerical study of the micro-jet velocity and the cavitation
- erosion on an axisymmetric nozzle, which presents high flow unsteadiness and aggressiveness.
The proposed model is based on energy conservation for the micro-jet velocity prediction, and
assumes the potential and kinetic energies, at the start and at the end of the cavity collapse,
respectively. The mass transport between liquid and vapor is closely related to Rayleigh
Plesset’s equation. Results have been obtained with a numerical scheme assuming homogeneous
mixture flow, implicit LES and Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation model. The 3D unsteady
flow simulation has been solved using OpenFOAM, whilst for the micro-jet estimation, Python
language coupled with OpenFOAM’s calculator have been used. Results clearly show that the
implemented model captures adequately the phenomenon and enables to identify attacked areas.
Outcomes agree reasonably with the experimental results obtained by Franc in the Laboratoire
de Écoulements Géophysiques et Industriels. Furthermore, results of the implemented Zwart-
Gerber-Belamri cavitation model with adaptive time step, showed more details related to the
cavitation shedding and detachment, which are important factors to predict erosion.

1. Introduction
To study cavitation-erosion is important not only to prevent the damage on hydraulic machinery
components as blades and guide vanes, but also for optimized designs [1, 2].The basic ideas of
the aforementioned topic are based on the work carried out by Hammitt [3, 4], who proposed
that the energy contained in a cavity is released as a water shock, which can be higher than
the material threshold strength. Kubota, Kato and Yamaguchi [5] proposed that the cavity
collapse must be in a trajectory close to the walls. Bark et al. [6] and Patella et al. [7] proposed
that potential energy stored in cavities is released during their collapse in cascade with the
consideration of an effective trajectory. Dular et al. [8, 9] proposed a numerical modeling of
cavitation erosion using the concepts of potential energy liberated in cascade and the high speed
micro-jet [10]. The model explains that the bubble collapse located in a specific layer releases
energy as a wave, which can re-energize bubbles close to hydrofoil walls. The collapse of the
bubbles cluster generates a high speed micro-jet and an impact load on the material similar to
a water hammer.

Bearing in mind these aspects, Hidalgo [11] proposed a cavitation-erosion model using
OpenFOAM and python language, which joined the potential energy in cavities with the kinetic
energy in the micro-jet. In this context, the proposed model has been applied to study cavitation-
erosion on a nozzle due to the highest aggressiveness of the phenomena, which was observed on
Franc’s studies [12].

2. Model description
Homogeneous mixture flow assumption, implicit large eddy turbulence model (ILES) and the
Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation model (ZGB) have been used for the numerical simulation of
unsteady cavitating flow, which is based on previous research [13].

The model considers the collapse of a vapor structure in one cell of volume V as indicated
in figure 1. The dimensionless micro-jet velocity, cflow, is expressed in (1) as a function of the
micro-jet velocity, ujet, and the undisturbed flow velocity, U∞ (31 m/s).

where γ is a dimensionless distance from the bubble centre to the wall [8], p is the static pressure,

fraction, and o and f are subscripts for the initial and final instant of the cavity collapse.

Furthermore, a qualitative value of flow ag-
gressiveness, cflow, can be estimated using (2)
to predict the affected region in relation with
its maximum value after one characteristic cav-
itation cycle. Where i is the subscript for each

3. Computational domain and boundary conditions
The computational domain and boundary conditions indicated in figure 2 were based on the
experimental studies carried out by Franc [12], and the numerical studies carried out by
Koukouvinis et al. [14]. Structured mesh with a mean y+ equal to 1.3 and 4.7 × 105 cells
was used for the numerical simulation, which is in accordance with previous research [11, 15].
Furthermore, the mesh was refined close to the bending part, walls and the possible erosion
target.

4. Results and discussion
Figure 3 (a) shows the comparison of erosion results between Franc’s studies [12] and the
proposed numerical simulation for the axisymmetric nozzle. The numerical result matched
fairly well the affected region of the experimental result, which is between radius of 19 mm and
32 mm with a maximum cflow between these two radius. A small region was selected from the
numerical part for a better understanding of the phenomenon and it is indicated in figure 3 (b).
From that region, a point called 1 was selected to study the ujet and to compare with the critical
velocity that the material can absorb, ucri., which is based on Lush’s observations [16].

Figure 4: cflow, α and Cp in function of ξ for point 1

The aforementioned figure shows that Cp fluctuates between -2 and 0 up to ξ = 0.6 mainly
due to the nozzle configuration and the turbulence [13]. In this range α is small and hence
it is not significant for cavity collapses. The maximum cflow is given after ξ = 0.8, which is
mainly relates to the fall of Cp with a value close to −σ and the presence of α. Furthermore, the
maximum cflow is two times higher than the ucri./U∞ for steel, which was estimated based on
Lush [16]. In this context, the tested plate of figure 3 can be eroded in a short period of time,
which agrees with the experimental data [12].

5. Conclusions
Results of the present research show that the proposed model can reproduce the cavitation-
erosion problem on an axisymmetric nozzle with enough accuracy compared with experimental
data. The model can be applied to study the induced erosion by cavitation on industrial
applications. Moreover, the maximum cflow of 8.71 found in the assessment is equivalent to
ujet = 270 m/s, and it highlights the necessity of compressible correlations for further analysis.
