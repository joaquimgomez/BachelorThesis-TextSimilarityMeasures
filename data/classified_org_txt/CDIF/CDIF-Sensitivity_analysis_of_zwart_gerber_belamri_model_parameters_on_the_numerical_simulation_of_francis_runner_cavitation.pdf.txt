Abstract 
A series of numerical simulations of the 3D cavitation development in the GAMM Francis turbine 
runner were carried out with the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) two-phase model available in ANSYS 
CFX v16.2. The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the influence of the ZGB parameters on the 
location, size and shape of the simulated cavitation. To begin, a sector of the entire fluid domain 
comprising a single blade was created taking profit from the rotational symmetry of the geometry and 
a stage simulation was set to simulate the flow field without cavitation. A grid independence analysis 
was carried out using the shear-stress transport (SST) turbulence model. Results such as the pressure 
drop and the torque at the best efficiency point (BEP) compared reasonably well with the experimental 
values, thus proving the model validity. The cavitation inception and development was simulated at 
BEP using the ZGB default parameters by progressively decreasing the sigma value. As expected, the 
onset of cavitation took place at the blade suction side close to the junction with the band, and the 
length and area of the blade cavity increased for decreasing sigma values. The cavity shape also showed 
a good agreement with the observations at the GAMM turbine model. Finally, the values corresponding 
to the mean nucleation site diameter, the nucleation site volume fraction and the empirical coefficients 
of evaporation and condensation were modified individually while keeping the rest constant in order 
to observe the changes in cavitation behavior. As a result, it was concluded that all the parameters have 
a significant effect in the cavity length, the pressure distribution and the torque. Moreover, extreme 
values leading to unrealistic results were also found.

Introduction 
Cavitation in hydraulic turbines is well known to be harmful because it can reduce the performance and provoke 
vibrations and erosion of the solid components. The turbine design combined with particular operating conditions 
such as the actual setting level of the unit and the deviation from the best efficiency point (BEP), among others, are 
the main factors that will determine the risk of cavitation and its consequences. Moreover, the cavitation phenomenon 
inside a turbine occurs under unsteady flows with 3D effects. For that, numerical and experimental investigations are 
still required to understand the physics of the phenomenon [1]. The computational fluid dynamics(CFD) software 
ANSYS CFX v16.2 incorporates the unsymmetrical cavitation model proposed by Zwart-Gerber-Belamri (ZGB) 
[2], which is based on the interphase mass transfer, �̇�𝑚, derived from the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The ZGB model 
is expressed by (1):

where Fv and Fc are the empirical calibration coefficients for vaporization and condensation respectively, rnuc is the 
nucleation site volume fraction and RB is the typical bubble radius of the nucleation site in water [3]. More specifically, 
the model default parameters are Fv = 50, Fc = 0.01, rnuc = 5⋅10-4 and RB = 2⋅10-6. The rest of variables are the vapor 
volume fraction, 𝛼𝛼, the liquid density, 𝜌𝜌𝑙𝑙, the vapor density, 𝜌𝜌𝑣𝑣, the time averaged pressure, 𝑃𝑃, and the liquid saturation 
pressure, 𝑃𝑃𝑣𝑣. The ZGB model has already been used and validated in several investigations for the numerical prediction 
of sheet cavitation around hydrofoils [4, 5], centrifugal pumps [6], marine propellers and Kaplan turbines [7] with 
fairly good results. Nevertheless, in all the cases it has been necessary to tune the model empirical coefficients to 
ensure the accuracy of the results.

In order to evaluate the influence of the ZGB model parameters on the numerical prediction of cavitation on the blades 
of a Francis runner, the GAMM Francis model geometry and performance [8, 9] were taken as a study case. More 
specifically, cavitation inception and development were simulated at the best efficiency point (BEP) which is 
characterized by a flow rate Q = 0,376 m3/s, a head H = 5,957 m, a rotating speed ω = 52,36 rad/s, and a torque T = 
388 Nm. 
The computational domain did not consider the distributor stay and guide vanes. The runner fluid domain was bounded 
upstream by a cylindrical surface located in the middle of the distributor channel and extended downstream up to a 
circular surface in the draft tube channel as indicated in Figure 1a. To reduce computational effort, a sector comprising 
only one inter-blade channel was created taking profit from the rotational symmetry of the runner and the existence 
of 13 blades as indicated in Figure 1b. The simulations were carried out using the Rotating Frames of Reference (RFR) 
and the Shear-Stress Transport (SST) turbulence models. Initially, a grid independency analysis was done with no 
cavitation model activated. The simulated torque and head values showed a good agreement with the experimental 
ones at BEP. As a result, an accurate mesh and the correct boundary conditions necessary to predict the expected 
behavior were established.

Cavitation simulations 
Initially, the cavitation development was simulated at BEP for different values of the outlet pressure, Pout, and using 
the ZGB default parameters. As a result, the typical torque rise for decreasing Sigma, σ, was correctly simulated (see 
Figure 1c). In our case, σ is calculated with (2) where g is the gravity: 

𝜎𝜎 = 𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜−𝑃𝑃𝑣𝑣

In Figure 2, the location, size and shape of the simulated leading edge cavity has been visualized with an isosurface 
of water vapor volume fraction equal to 0.5. As σ decreases, cavitation develops on the blades. A good similarity with 
the visual observations in the reduced scale GAMM turbine model at σ = 0.14 [6] is found with the numerical results 
at σ = 0.15, which is also in accordance with the works of Susan-Resiga et al. [7-8].

To study the influence of the ZGB parameters on the numerical results at σ = 0.15, each of the values indicated in 
Table 1 were considered individually while keeping the rest of them at their default values. The plots shown in Figure 
3 correspond to the contours of absolute wall pressures and the 0.5 water vapor volume fraction isosurfaces for the 
different Fv (a), Fc (b), rnuc (c) and RB (d) values, from top to bottom rows respectively. 
As it can be observed, unrealistic results were found for extreme values two orders of magnitude higher or lower than 
the default ones. In such cases, the torque can deviate more than 10% from the nominal value because the pressure 
distribution around the blade and the water vapor phase appear significantly altered. In particular, the possible range 
of values for each parameter that keep the expected runner efficiency are [0.5 – 500] for Fv, [0.0001 - 0.1] for Fc, 
[5⋅10-5 - 5⋅10-3] for rnuc and [2⋅10-7 - 2⋅10-5] for RB.

Regarding the cavitation development on the blade, all the parameters have a main influence on its length along the 
junction between the blade and the runner band. More specifically, Fv determines the location of both the cavitation 
inception and of the closure region, meanwhile Fc only determines the location of the cavitation closure. On the other 
hand, rnuc shows a similar effect to Fv, and RB shows a similar effect to the reciprocal of Fc. 

Conclusion 

The default values of the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri cavitation model available in ANSYS CFX v16.2 appear to provide 
results that are in accordance with the cavitation observations in the GAMM Francis turbine runner at BEP. 
Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the inception and closure locations of the inlet edge cavitation to these parameters is 
found to be significant when they are increased or decreased by at least one order of magnitude. Moreover, unrealistic 
results are obtained if extreme values of the parameters are considered.
