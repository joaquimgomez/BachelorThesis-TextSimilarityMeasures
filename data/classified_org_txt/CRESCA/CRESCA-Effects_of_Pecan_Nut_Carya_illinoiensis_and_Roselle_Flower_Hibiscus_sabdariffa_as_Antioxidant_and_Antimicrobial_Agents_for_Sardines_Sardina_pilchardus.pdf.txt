Abstract: The effects of pecan nut (Carya illinoinensis) and roselle flower (Hibiscus sabdariffa) as
antioxidant and antimicrobial agents on shelf life extension of sardines (Sardina pilchardus) were
evaluated over a period of 5 days at 7± 1 ◦C. Treatments consisted of the addition of 5% and 10% w/w
pecan nut, 5% w/w roselle flower and a combination of 5% of each. Physicochemical (lipid oxidation,
fatty acids, hexanal and biogenic amines), sensory and microbiological characteristics of fish samples
were periodically analyzed. All treatments effectively improved physicochemical quality parameters,
with 10% w/w pecan nut having the highest effectiveness. The presence of roselle flower reduced
microbial growth. Our findings suggest that addition of a natural preservative combining pecan nut
and roselle flower may extend the shelf life of fresh sardines during chilled storage while maintaining
quality indexes.

1. Introduction

Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) fisheries have an important economic impact on Europe and North
Africa. Its production in Europe reached 175 thousand tonnes in 2014, with a value of 161 million
euro [1]. Due to its high content of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) the sardine is a
highly perishable fish with remarkable nutritional benefits for human health [2]. Lipid oxidation causes
rancidity, off-taste, off-odor and color changes, which can affect consumer’s perception. Synthetic
antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [3] are
used to extend its shelf life, but health problems derived from excessive consumption of these
antioxidants have been reported [4]. Therefore, there is increasing concern from consumers and
the food industry to avoid the use of artificial antioxidants and find healthier alternatives. The research
and use of natural antioxidants present in spices, herbs, fruits, plants or teas containing high levels of
phenols, anthocyanins and ascorbic acid (among other compounds, which can act as radical scavengers
and prevent the reaction of lipid peroxidation), has increased [5]. Moreover, consumption of plants
containing natural phenolic compounds, has been described to prevent free radical formation and
reduce the risk of developing cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease, among
others pathologies [6].

Pecan nut (Carya illinoinensis) has been shown to contain the highest amount of phytochemicals
of all nut types [7]. Studies show strong correlations between inclusion of pecan nut in the diet and
reduction of triacylglycerides, LDL cholesterol and increase of HDL colesterol [8]. This beneficial
effect in the health comes from the high amounts of phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins,
monounsaturated fatty acids and tocopherols present in pecan nut [9].

Previous research on the use of walnut as an antioxidant for meat showed its effectiveness on
preventing food deterioration. In addition, tacking on walnut paste to meat improved MUFA and
PUFA contents and amino acid profiles [10].

Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) flowers contain high, but variable amounts, depending on the cultivar,
of total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanidins, and was reported to possess antimicrobial activity
for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [11].

The aim of this research is to test the effectivity of pecan nut as a natural preservative to delay the
oxidation of naturally occurring fish lipids. To this effect, sardine was chosen because it is a fish known
to contain high amounts of fat, therefore acknowledging that if pecan nut works as a preservative for
sardine it could be implied that it would also work for other fish species with less amounts of fat. Also,
other objective was to assess the antimicrobial effect of roselle flowers, to be used alone or combined
as natural antioxidants or preservatives for the food industry.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Determination of Total Phenolic Content and DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity

The total phenolic content (TPC) of defatted pecan nut and roselle flower were measured
on the corresponding ethanol extracts (50%) and no significant difference was found, while the
radical scavenging activity (RSA) was significantly higher in defatted pecan kernels than in roselle
flower extracts.

TPC content and RSA for defatted pecan nut kernel and roselle flower ethanol extracts varied
significantly in previous research. This variability could result from the origin and cultivar of each
sample. Table 1 displays the results obtained in this work.

Table 1. Total phenolic compounds and radical scavenging activity 1.

Sample TPC (mg GAE/g FW) RSA (mg TE/g DW)

Defatted Pecan Nut kernel 22.95 ± 0.04 37.63 ± 1.08
Roselle flower 22.40 ± 0.02 19.69 ± 0.42

1 Results were expressed as miligrams gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of fresh sample weight (FW) and
miligrams of Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of dry sample.

The total phenolic content (TPC) of defatted pecan nut and roselle presented no significant
difference (22.95 mg GAE/g FW± 0.04 and 22.40 mg GAE/g FW± 0.02), the radical scavenging activity
(RSA) is significantly higher in defatted pecan kernels (37.63 mg TE/g FW ± 1.08 and 19.69 mg TE/g
FW ± 0.42 for defatted pecan kernels and roselle, respectively). Results expressed as mean ± SD
(n = 3).

Values for TPC content and RSA for defatted pecan nut kernel vary significantly in the literature:
Alasalvar and Shahidi [12] reported similar results for TPC in pecan; Villarreal-Lozoya, Lombardini
and Cisneros-Zevallos [13] obtained around double TPC and triple RSA mean values. A review on
tree nut phytochemicals by Bolling et al. [7] described a smaller value for TPC and higher for RSA.
De la Rosa et al. [8] reported similar but lower RSA pecan nut kernel mean values. Mak et al. [14]
obtained a two-fold higher TPC and very similar RSA value for roselle flower ethanol extract and
Afify and Hassan [15] described much lower TPC and RSA values. Possible reasons for the great
variability found in literature values could be related to the origin and cultivar of each sample.

2.2. Microbiological Analysis

Presence of colony-forming units was evaluated in the treatments (control, 5% w/w PN,
10% w/w PN, 5% w/w R, 5% w/w PN + 5% w/w R, and 0.1% w/w BHA) with one and three days of
incubation after treatment (Table 2). The main goal of this analysis was to assess the antimicrobial
properties of roselle flower and pecan nut as well as checking initial contamination of the samples,
with a qualitative analysis. The amount of bacteria present in all samples at day one of incubation was
less than 10 CFU/g sample. Three days’ post-treatment showed that roselle flower and BHA acted as
antimicrobial agents. Our findings are consistent with previous reports in which roselle flower was
successfully used to disinfect carrots, tomatoes [16] and Hass avocado [17]. The results of the present
study suggest that roselle flower can be used to supplement the antioxidant activity of pecan nut,
hence obtaining a food preservative with both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.

2.3. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS)

The TBARS method is widely used for determining the oxidation of fats and oils in foods.
Malondialdehyde compounds are formed when the concentration of hydroperoxides is appreciable in
oil or fat. Hydroperoxides decompose to form secondary oxidation products [18,19]. Results shown in
Figure 1 and Table 3 indicate that after 66 h of incubation in the fridge, samples containing 10% w/w of
pecan nut were significantly less oxidized than in any other condition, including incubation with the
artificial antioxidant BHA. Until 50 h all treatments, except the control, follow a similar trend; after,
there is a noticeable increase of oxidation rate in samples containing 5% w/w pecan nut and 0.1% BHA.
Samples with 5% w/w roselle flower and 5% of both pecan nut and roselle flower were also effective
in relation to the control. Özogul et al. [20] studied the effects of rosemary and sage tea extracts in
preventing lipid oxidation of sardine at 3 ◦C after six days. Erkan et al. [21] reported TBARS values of
sardine storage at 2 ◦C after five days using thyme and laurel essential oils. Results in both studies
and in the present work follow a similar tendency and together support the idea that the addition of
natural compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity provides an effective methodology to
extend shelf life of fresh sardine.

2.4. FA Analysis 

FAME analysis was used to assess the amount of FA present in sardine loins and monitor 
changes among samples containing pecan nut and roselle flower. Results are displayed in Table 4. 

FA present in a higher amount in the control and samples treated with 0.1% BHA are myristic 
acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (C18:1n), 
erucic acid (C22:1n9), linoleic acid (C18:2n6c), α-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) and cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-
docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA, C22:6n3). The FA composition ranged from 33.89 to 38.39% of 
saturated FA (SFA), 23.44 to 27.04% of monounsaturated FA (MUFAs) and 25.04 to 31.89% of 
polyunsaturated FA (PUFAs). Even though FA amounts in sardine may vary significantly 
depending on the origin and season, the results of the present study are in agreement with those 
obtained previously for sardine muscle [22]. FA content in samples incubated with 5% w/w and 10% 
w/w pecan nut vary significantly in relation to the control due to the presence in pecan nuts of 
amounts four-fold higher of oleic acid (C18:1n) and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c) [23]. As a consequence, 
total SFA is halved, MUFA doubled and PUFA content remains similar compared to control 
samples. Therefore, the use of pecan nuts would have a beneficial side effect by increasing the total 
amount of the healthier types of FA (MUFA and PUFA). 

Incubation with 5% w/w roselle flower did not significantly changed FA amounts compared 
with control samples. Palmitic acid, oleic acid and DHA are the acids with a higher percentage

2.4. FA Analysis

FAME analysis was used to assess the amount of FA present in sardine loins and monitor changes
among samples containing pecan nut and roselle flower. Results are displayed in Table 4.

FA present in a higher amount in the control and samples treated with 0.1% BHA
are myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1),
oleic acid (C18:1n), erucic acid (C22:1n9), linoleic acid (C18:2n6c), α-linolenic acid (C18:3n3) and
cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA, C22:6n3). The FA composition ranged from 33.89
to 38.39% of saturated FA (SFA), 23.44 to 27.04% of monounsaturated FA (MUFAs) and 25.04 to
31.89% of polyunsaturated FA (PUFAs). Even though FA amounts in sardine may vary significantly
depending on the origin and season, the results of the present study are in agreement with those
obtained previously for sardine muscle [22]. FA content in samples incubated with 5% w/w and 10%
w/w pecan nut vary significantly in relation to the control due to the presence in pecan nuts of amounts
four-fold higher of oleic acid (C18:1n) and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c) [23]. As a consequence, total SFA is
halved, MUFA doubled and PUFA content remains similar compared to control samples. Therefore,
the use of pecan nuts would have a beneficial side effect by increasing the total amount of the healthier
types of FA (MUFA and PUFA).

Incubation with 5% w/w roselle flower did not significantly changed FA amounts compared with
control samples. Palmitic acid, oleic acid and DHA are the acids with a higher percentage within
control samples. These results are similar to those previous studies [24] reporting the presence of

myristic (2.1%), palmitic (35.2%), palmitoleic (2.0%), stearic (3.4%), oleic (34.0%) and linoleic (14.4%)
acids in roselle seeds.

All treatments promoted low levels of arachidonic acid (C20:4n6, 0.03–0.58%), which may have
antagonistic effects to the health benefits of the n3 FA [25]. Moreover, the UK Department of Health
recommends a maximum ratio of n6/n3 of 4.0, which is much higher than in any of the present
treatments (0.04–0.07%) [26]. Indeed, a minimum value of PUFA/SFA ratio recommended is 0.45 [26]
which is lower than those obtained for all fish treatments (0.65–2.86%).

Palmitic acid was the primary saturated FA, contributing 9.33–26.44% of total SFA in all treatments.
Oleic acid was the major MUFA, accounting for 15.03–52.62% of total MUFAs and linoleic acid as well as
DHA were the major FA identified as PUFAs, accounting for 6.22–31.30% and 1.04–22.98%, respectively.

2.5. Determination of Hexanal by HS-GC-MS

Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids generates hydroperoxides, highly reactive substances which
rapidly decompose into volatile and non-volatile compounds such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids,
aldehydes and ketones [27]. These are called secondary lipid oxidation products and contribute to
flavor and taste deterioration. Among these products, hexanal is a by-product of lipid oxidation
that is mainly generated by oxidation ofω-6 fatty acid peroxides, mostly from linoleic acid through
13-hydroperoxide [28].

Sample content of hexanal greatly changed during the treatment (Figure 2). At day 5 post-treatment,
control samples exhibited the highest levels, which were 20-fold greater than control values at the
beginning of the experiment (day 0). The lower levels of hexanal were found in samples containing
a 10% w/w of pecan nut: barely detectable levels at day 0 and slightly increased values at day 5
of incubation. These results suggest that 10% w/w pecan nut was the most effective treatment for
preventing hexanal formation as a by-product of lipid oxidation. Samples with 5% w/w pecan nut
and 0.1% w/w BHA presented similar increased levels of hexanal after 5 days of treatment, which
indicated that 5% w/w of pecan nut is enough to equal the effects of current artificial antioxidants.
Our findings also suggest that roselle flower can prevent hexanal formation.

2.6. Biogenic Amine (BA) Analysis

BAs are basic nitrogenous compounds usually generated in foods and beverages by microbial
decarboxylation of amino acids or amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones [29].
In non-fermented foods the presence of BA above a certain level is considered to be indicative of
undesired microbial activity. Therefore, the amine level could be used as an indicator of microbial
spoilage [29]. The best-known type of food poisoning caused by BA derives from consumption of
high levels of histamine. It is also referred to as “scromboid fish poisoning” because of the frequent
association of this illness with consumption of scrombroid fish such as tuna, mackerel, saury, bonito,
seer fish and butterfly kingfish. Non-scrombroid fish like sardine, anchovy, marline or herring have
also been implicated in cases of histamine poisoning [30]. Putrescine and cadaverine, which are present
in high levels in toxic fish, have been reported to potentiate the biological effects of histamine up to ten
times [31]. In the European Union (EU) the legal limit for histamine levels is 100 mg/kg in raw fish.



Molecules 2019, 24, 85 7 of 13

In the present study, the amount of BA in sardine flesh significantly varied depending on the
treatment (Table 5). Other authors have reported similar results for the quantification of BA in sardine
in a period between 3–6 days while stored with refrigeration [20]. As for the effectiveness of the
treatments, after 5 days of incubation, samples containing 10% w/w of pecan nut had much lower
amounts of BA than the control and any other treatment. Since BA result from protein decomposition,
the results obtained indicate that pecan nut may be more effective in preserving sardine meat than the
artificial food preservative BHA. Samples containing 5% w/w pecan nut showed also better results in
preventing the formation of most BA than BHA (in the used concentration). Most BA levels in samples
treated with the antimicrobial compound roselle flower were similar or higher than in control samples.
Karabacak and Bozkurt [32] reported histamine, putrescine and tyramine concentrations in sucuk
batters during the ripening period. In this study, the BA content in samples incubated with roselle
flower were similar or smaller than the control, although samples containing roselle flower doubled
the amount of tyramine present in controls at day 4, which follows the same tendency shown in this
study (Table 5).

2.7. Sensory Analysis

In order to know the acceptability of this new product, sensory analysis was performed, using
Basker’s tables, establishing a significant difference for 28.5 points. Given that no such difference was
found for any of the fish patties included in the preference sensory analysis, no treatment could be
established as the preferred one by participants. The results for 5% pecan nut + 5% roselle, 5% pecan
nut, control, 10% pecan nut were a total rank of 98, 91, 99 and 80, respectively. General assessor’s
comments point out that patties with fish incubated with roselle flower had an acid shade and boosted
fish taste. The other three treatments were considered very similar, although pecan nut seemed to
soften fishy flavor and even make the sample taste like meat. In fact, lower scores are considered to
indicate higher taster’s acceptability and the lowest value was attributed to samples with 10% w/w
pecan nut.

3. Materials and Methods

3.1. Natural Products

Pecan nuts and roselle flowers purchased in a local market in Mexico were frozen with liquid
nitrogen and shredded with a mortar.

3.2. Preparation of Extracts for Determination of Total Phenolic Content and DPPH Radical Activity Scavenging

Extracts were prepared in order to assay radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content.
Defatted pecan nut kernels and roselle flowers were weighed (1 g) and extracted with 20 mL of 50:50



Molecules 2019, 24, 85 8 of 13

(v/v) ethanol-water at and 10 mL of 70:30 (v/v) ethanol-water with 0.1% (v/v) HCl 37%, respectively.
Pecan nut extract was stirred for 90 min at room temperature and roselle flower extract at 60 ◦C.
Both extracts were centrifuged and the supernatants were stored at −20 ◦C in darkness until analysis.

3.3. Antioxidant Analyses of Extracts of Pecan Nut and Roselle

3.3.1. DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity

Radical scavenging potential of pecan nut and roselle was evaluated using the DPPH method
described by Gallego et al. [33]. Results are expressed in µmol Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g of sample
weight (SW) ± SD. Measurements were done in triplicate for each sample.

3.3.2. Determination of Total Phenolic Content

The Folin-Ciocalteu (Folin) method was used to measure the total polyphenol content of the
extract [34]. Measurements were done in triplicate for each sample. Results are expressed as mg Gallic
Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g of SW ± SD.

3.4. Fish Sample Preparation

Fresh sardines with an average weight and length of 27.2 g ± 7.5 and 14.8 cm ± 1.25 respectively,
results expressed as mean ± SD (standard deviation) and with n = 10, were purchased from a local
market in Barcelona, and transported under refrigeration to the laboratory. Fish were gutted and head,
tail and spine were removed, keeping only the loins.

3.5. Preparation of Samples

Sardine patties were prepared in order to measure the evolution of a range of parameters
throughout a period of time. Burgers were prepared by shredding sardine flesh and adding direct and
minced pecan nut and rosolle with the following treatments: control (1% w/w salt), 5% PN (5% w/w
pecan nut, 1% salt), 10% PN (10% w/w pecan nut, 1% salt), 5%R (5% w/w roselle, 1% salt), 5%PN +
5%R (5% w/w pecan nut, 5% w/w roselle, 1% salt), 0.1% BHA (0.1% w/w BHA, 1% salt). Samples were
kept at 7 ± 1 ◦C until analysis.

3.6. Microbiological Analysis

Microbiological analysis was performed to assay sample contamination with mesophilic bacteria.
To perform the analysis, 10 g of sample were added to 90 mL of Ringer solution and homogenized
with a Stomacher for 5 min. Triptone Soya Agar (TSA) was used as the growth media and plaques
were incubated at 35 ◦C. The recount was performed after 24 h and 48 h.

3.7. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS)

Determination of TBARS value was performed following the method described by
Gallego et al. [34] with some modification. Triplicates of 0.5 g for each sample were weighed, added
0.5 mL 0.3% EDTA solution and 2.5 mL TBARS reagent and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax
blender (Ika-Werke, GmbH & Co, Staufen, Germany) for 1 min. During all procedure’s tubes were
kept in an ice bath to prevent sample deterioration. They were then filtered with Whatman filters
no. 1 and the reaction was activated through insertion of the tubes in a water bath at 95 ± 1 ◦C
for 10 min. After cooling RT, absorbance was measured at 531 nm in a UV/VIS microplate reader
spectrophotometer Fluostar Ω (Paris, France). Results were expressed as mg of malondialdehyde
(MDA)/kg sample.

3.8. Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) Analysis

Fatty acids (FA) analysis was performed according to the method described by Viegas et al. [35]
with modifications. Duplicates of 200 mg of sample were weighed into glass tubes and 750 µL of



Molecules 2019, 24, 85 9 of 13

methanol:water solution 2:1 (v/v), followed by 500 µL of chloroform and 250 µL Milli-Q water were
added, vortexing for 1 min after each addition. Thereafter, the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g,
4 ◦C for 20 min. The lower layer was transferred to opaque vials and evaporated at 25 ◦C, with a
nitrogen stream until only oil residue was present. Following addition of 2 mL hexane, the samples
were vortexed for 30 s and left to rest for 5 min, to ensure fat dilution in hexane. Afterwards, 200 mL
2 M potassium hydroxide in methanol solution were added and the samples centrifuged for 10 min at
2000 g. The upper phase was transferred into a 2 mL tube and kept at−80 ◦C until gas chromatography
analysis was performed.

FA composition was analyzed using a GC-2025 with autosampler (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan),
equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a BPX-70 (SGE) column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.25 mm,
df 0.25 µm). Temperature in the oven was 60

◦C for 1 min and then it was raised to 260 ◦C at the rate
of 6 ◦C/min, while the injector and the detector temperatures were set at 260 and 280 ◦C, respectively.
Sample volume was 1 mL and the carrier gas was helium. The split used was 1:20. FAME were
identified by comparing the retention times of standard 37 component FAME mixture. Two replicate
GC analyses were performed and the results were expressed in GC area % as mean values ± sd.

3.9. Determination of Hexanal by HS-GC/MS

0.5 g of minced sample was added to 1.5 mL milli-Q water in a headspace vial, which was
then sealed air-tight with a PTFE septum. The standard curve was prepared using hexanal with
concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.450 ppm. Results were expressed in mg hexanal/g sardine.

The vials were incubated at 80 ◦C during 30 min. The analysis was performed by HS-GC/MS,
by injecting 1 mL of vapor phase through a special syringe kept at 85 ◦C. Equipment used consisted
of a Trace GC gas chromatograph with a Head Space Triplus autosampler coupled to a DSQII mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, Texas, USA) with TRB-624 (60 m × 0.32 mm × 1.8 mm)
column, 1.8 mL/min helium flow. The injector temperature was 220 ◦C with split mode injection (split
flow 20 mL/min). Temperature program was 60 ◦C held for 2 min and then raised to 220 ◦C at the
rate of 8 ◦C/min (5 min). Interface temperature was 260 ◦C and ionization source temperature 230 ◦C.
Ionization mode: electron ionization, SCAN mode (29–250 amu).

3.10. Biogenic amines (BA) Analysis

Samples were prepared according to the method of Komprda et al. [36] with some modifications.
1 g of sample was extracted with 2 mL of HCl 0.1 M and homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax blender
(Ika-Werke, GmbH & Co, Staufen, Germany) for 1 min. Homogenized samples were centrifuged
for 15 min at 4 ◦C and 2000 g. The supernatant was separated and the solid residue was repeatedly
extracted with 2 mL of HCl 0.01 M, vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged for 15 min with the same
conditions. The supernatant was separated again and the combined extracts were made up to 10 mL.
The samples were filtered through 0.45 µm filter prior to liquid chromatography analysis.

BA analysis was performed following the method of Hernández-Jover et al. [37]. As biogenic
amine standards histamine (HIS), tyramine (TYR), serotonin (SER), tryptamine (TRP), octopamine
(OC) hydrochloride, dopamine (DO) 3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride, cadaverine (CAD), putrescine
(PUT), spermine (SPM), and spermidine (SPD) were used. A concentrated 1000 mg/L stock solution
as a free base for each biogenic amine in 0.1 M HCl was prepared. A 50 mg/L intermediate solution
was prepared in 0.1 M HCl from the stock solution. Calibration standards of 0.25 mg/L for all
amines and 2 mg/L for spermine were prepared in 0.1 M HCl from the intermediate standard
solution, stored at 4 ◦C and protected from light. The HPLC analysis parameters, mobile phase,
gradient program, postcolumn derivatizating reagent and other procedures were as described in
Hernández-Jover et al. [37].

3.11. Preference Sensory Analysis

Sensory analysis was conducted by a taste panel consisting of 37 semi-trained judges (21 males
and 16 females) with age ranging from 17 to 60. All participants declared that they do not suffer from
dried fruits allergy. Participants tasted four fish patties, each corresponding to 18 h of incubation of
sardine loins with the following additions: 5% w/w pecan nut, 10% w/w pecan nut, 5% w/w pecan
nut + 5% w/w roselle flower and control (nothing added). The samples were distributed in plates and
coded with a random three digit number. The subjects were instructed to taste each sample and grade
them from 1 (most preferred) to 4 (least preferred). Results were analyzed using the tables developed
by Basker [38].

3.12. Statistical Analysis

The mean value and standard deviation were calculated from the data obtained from the three
samples for each treatment. Where significant differences were detected by one-way Anova, means
were compared using Turkey’s test p < 0.05. All statistics were performed using Minitab-16 for
Windows software (Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA).

4. Conclusions

The study showed those pecan nut and roselle flowers are highly effectivity as a fish preservative,
thus opening the way to perform other experiments varying the fish type or even switching to pecan
nut byproducts such as leaves or shell. It can be understood as a preliminary study to assess the
interaction between pecan nut and fish lipids. All analyses showed that samples treated with pecan
nut and roselle flower had better quality parameters than the control.

Adding pecan nut to sardine, creates a functional product which is useful. First, because it
enhances the shelf-life of sardine and second because it has an increased percentage of healthy
monounsaturated fatty acids and a smaller percentage of saturated fatty acids. This research shows
that when adding pecan nut to sardine the amount of linoleic acid (Ω-6 fatty acid family) is more than
tripled (from an average percentage of 15% to 50% of the total amount of fatty acids). Linoleic acid
is one of the two essential fatty acids that need to be ingested through food since the body cannot
synthesize them. The other most notable change when adding pecan nut to sardine is the increase
of the average percentage of oleic acid (Ω-9 family) from 6.5% to 28% (more than four times greater).
This monounsaturated fatty acid is also known for its beneficial effects on health such as reducing
blood pressure. Pecan nut alone or in combination with roselle flower has potential to be used as a
natural food preservative for the food industry.
