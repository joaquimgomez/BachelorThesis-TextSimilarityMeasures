ABSTRACT 

 

The presence of coating on manufactures either to protect them from the environment, 

or to give them specific properties - as well as simply to change their aspect - has shown 

to be a constant practise throughout history. Their characterization is complex not only 

because of the inherent variability and diversity of the composition, but also due to the 

small amount of sample material available. A methodology to study those coatings 

using microFTIR is proposed. In some cases the use of microSR-FTIR which heavily 

increases spatial resolution particularly appropriate for the analysis of these 

heterogeneous samples is also proposed. Data processing tools such as distribution 

maps of specific infrared bands and curve fitting facilitate the interpretation of the 

spectra and help identifying heavily overlapped spectra. Through the identification of 

individual bands, it has been possible to discriminate materials and comprehend the 

interaction processes during aging. Infrared spectra from reference aged materials of 

known production dates and which are essential in understanding those processes are 

given. A set of selected case studies including materials of different chemical nature and 

various historical periods are presented: identification of guanine on an inner coating of 

a hope chest; determination of a protein glue coating from a gilded Baroque altarpiece; 

assessment of a beeswax superficial application during an historical restoration of a late 

19
th

 century canvas painting; identification of impurities of shellac wax in a shellac 

coating on a wood moulding from a medieval altarpiece; aging and reaction compounds 

in Pinus resin, drying oil and green copper pigment mixtures used as colour coatings on 

Baroque and modern desks.

1. Introduction 

 

The application of organic coatings on historic manufactures either to protect them from 

the environment or to give them specific properties - as well as simply to change their 

aspect - has been a constant practise throughout history [1]. 

 

The materials used for the purpose are very diverse in nature, depending on what the 

covering was intended for, the availability of the materials, the easeness of application, 

or simply the fashion in the historic period [2]. 

 

Being at the surface, such covering layers are often totally/partially lost depending on 

the material properties, and frequently appear substituted by modern materials. Their 

characterization is in general complex not only because of the inherent variability and 

diversity of the  substances present, but also due to the small amount of sample material 

available, generally a micrometric layer (between 5-10 µm), often modified by 

subsequent restorations [3]. 

 

As in other studies related to cultural heritage materials, the aging and alteration of the 

original materials, that is, the chemical reactions occurring with atmospheric pollutans 

and among the substances - contemporaneous or not to the piece under study -must be 

taken into account. This implies that the reference materials we have access to can 

hardly correspond to the historic materials, as they reached us. 

 

The knowledge of the nature of these materials is, however, of great interest for a 

number of reasons; first, the historical insight obtained about the techniques used in the 

manufacture of the objects: the making of, including processing from centre of 

production to finished artwork, their relationship to contemporary artists or workshops, 

and the identification of the natural sources. Secondly, elucidating the conservation 

conditions in order to plan, if necessary, the optimal restoration strategy. 

 

The availability of standardized and increasingly faster infrared (IR) equipment together 

with the intrinsic high sensitivity of the absorption set-up in the mid-infrared spectral 

range have made of IR one of the most widely used techniques for the characterisation 

of cultural heritage materials [4]. The principal advantages are related to the small 

quantity of sample needed, the easeness of identification of very diverse materials, the 

speed at which results can be obtained via IR fingerprinting, the low cost of analysis 

and the non destructiveness character of the technique. 

 

The coupling of IR spectroscopy to a microscope extends its capabilities into the 

microanalytical range, providing the spatial resolution necessary for the identification of 

submillimitric structures/particles. It is more and more common to find infrared 

microscopes in laboratories dedicated to the microanalysis of cultural heritage materials. 

Adequate selection of the samples for analysis is especially challenging given the small 

quantity of material available from the historic objects [5,6]. 

 

Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometry is the standard lab method which 

provides easy spectral information and identification of the coating materials when a

reference database is available [7-9]. The main object of this article is to demonstrate 

the advantage of this technique for the identification of those coatings over more precise 

or costly and lengthy techniques such as GC-MS [10]. Nevertheless, when those 

techniques are needed, the information that is available from FTIR microanalysis 

(µFTIR) has been shown to be always a key in the characterization process and its 

optimization [11]. 

 

Another objects of this research is to investigate the spectral and spatial features across 

the submillimetric historic surface layer, identifying the spatial distribution of the 

chemical substances. For this reason Synchrotron Radiation FTIR microspectroscopy 

(µSR-FTIR) was used to obtain the necessary spectral quality - high signal-to-noise 

ratio - at the maximum IR magnification available - 36x - for an improved minimum 

detection limit and reliable interpretation of the spectra with few microns spatial 

resolution [5, 12]. This goes beyond the limits of spectral interpretation by conventional 

IR techniques and is vital for the study of historical samples. 

 

Many types of coating materials have been used over time. They can be essentially 

classified into five main groups: waxes, oils, gums, resins and protein materials [13]. 

The resins used are secretions of animal or vegetal origin, which can be chemically 

differentiated into several large families; sesquiterpenoids (shellac), triterpenoids 

(mastic, elemi and dammar), diterpenoids based in the communic acid (sandarac, amber 

and copal) and diterpenoids based in the abietic acid (colophony and turpentine) [13]. 

However, we sometimes find unexpected substances which presence must be accounted 

for. 

 

A methodology for the analysis of the coatings using µFTIR is herewith proposed that 

permits to obtain definitive results, or at least to delimit the analysis features in an easier 

and more focused way. With the advantage of being non-destructive, the same sample 

preparation may be reused. Various examples corresponding to materials of a different 

chemical nature, applied with different purposes and at different historical periods are 

shown.  

 

 

2. Materials and methods 

 

2.1 Reference samples 

 

A set of reference materials has been collected, selected and naturally aged from 

different restoration workshops, dry goods shops and commercial products and of 

natural origin from the author’s own collection. In addition, naturally aged Pinaceae 

resin materials (about two centuries) were supplied by “Economic Botany Collection of 

the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew”, in Richmond (Greater London - UK). Moreover, a 

resin from the 14
th

 century was obtained from a knot of a dated coffered ceiling made of 

Pinus wood. Finally, copper abietate was synthesized following the method from L. 

Steele [14] using abietic acid (Fluka Analytical ref. 101392305) and CuSO4·5H2O 

(Panreac ref. 131270.1211).

Historic coating samples, a few hundred micrometres in size, extracted from several art-

works have been analysed. The samples were obtained from: an16
th

 century hope chest 

(MADB9909 reference number), an early 20
th

 century writing desk (MADB71747 

reference number) and a writing desk from the last quarter of the 17
th

 century 

(MADB64160 reference number) all them belonging to the Museu del Disseny de 

Barcelona [15]. Some other samples were obtained from a Baroque altarpiece dedicated 

to Santa Càndia from the Cathedral of Santa Maria de Tortosa (Catalonia); a canvas 

entitled View of the Barcelona Port (2,18 m x 7,30 m in size) by Francesc Soler i 

Rovirosa, painted in 1889 from the Museu Marítim de Barcelona [16]; a gothic 

altarpiece dedicated to Our Lady, by Pasqual Ortoneda, on display at the Museum 

Vinseum (Vilafranca del Penedès, Catalonia); and a polychrome wood coffered ceiling 

in the 14
th

 century from Santa Maria de Paretdelgada Chapel (La Selva del Camp, 

Catalonia). 

 

2.3 Analytical instrumentation and methods 

 

2.3.1 Microscopic observations (OM) 

The microsamples were observed, handled and fragments selected for analysis with a 

Stereomicroscope, SMZ800 Nikon. Flat sites from selected fragments were observed 

with an Optical microscope Eclipse LV100 Nikon under visible and UV light. 

 

2.3.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectrometry (EDS) 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), JEOL-5600, with elemental analysis using the 

PCXA LINK EDS microanalyzer are used in order to obtain information of the 

composition and thickness of the layers of the samples. Small fragments were carbon 

coated to ensure the electrical conductivity. 

 

2.3.3 Infrared spectroscopy  

Selected fragments were analysed using mid infrared microspectroscopy, µFTIR. The 

measurements were taken in transmission mode using an AIM-8800 microscope with an 

MCT detector coupled to the Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 FTIR spectrometer. A 

transmission spectrum requires a flat sample with an adequate thickness. For this, 

selected fragments were squeezed between two diamonds into an anvil cell. The spectra 

were taken from one of the diamonds and a spot of 100x100 and 40x40 square 

micrometres surface area was analysed. This procedure helps the separation of the 

different compounds present. The measurement interval was 4000-700 cm
-1

 with a 

resolution of 4 cm
-1 

and 256 scans. 

 

Synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopy (µSR-FTIR) measurements were taken 

at beamline MIRIAM B22 of the Diamond Light Source [17]. Two Bruker 80 V Fourier 

Transform IR Interferometers are equipped with Hyperion 3000 microscope, and broad-

band and high sensitivity MCT detectors. The spectra were obtained in transmission 

mode from a sample dispersed on a diamond window following the same  compression 

cell preparation method described above, using a small beamspot of 12x12 square 

microns, 4 cm
-1

 resolution , co-adding 256 scan at scanner velocity 80 kHz (35 sec), in 

the 4000 to 650 cm
-1

 or 500 cm
-1

 wavenumber range. IR maps of the molecular 

composition were obtained by scanning the sample via a micrometric resolution 

motorized X-Y stage.

An accurate analysis of the spectrum is able to resolve overlapped bands [18]; When has 

been needed overlapped bands have been processed using the curve fitting software 

from OPUS 7.2. First, the spectra have been baseline corrected then the band positions 

have been found from the second derivative of the curve and finally, the spectrum is 

fitted by a set of Lorentzian curves. The method is applied to fit all the bands appearing 

only the significant ones are shown.  

 

 

3. Results and discussion 

 

3.1 Guanine, unexpected coating 
  

The first example corresponds to the coating material from the interior of a hope chest 

dated from 16
th

 century by historians, obtained during the process of restoration.  

 

The very thin coating layer is directly applied onto the wood; the sample was 

mechanically extracted under the stereomicroscope to help choosing the most 

representative areas which were measured with µFTIR. The material was fragile, 

translucent and uncoloured, Fig. 1a.  

 

Two different materials have been identified; anhydrous guanine [19] and a protein 

substance shown in Fig. 1b,c respectively. Guanine is a material used in pigment 

production to obtain a nacreous (pearlescent) effect, a natural pearl essence pigment as 

well as, to make synthetic pearls and cosmetic products. 

 

Guanine appears as small crystallites of alongated shape, about 10-40 microns length 

and 40-50 microns thickness; it has a low density 1.6 g/cm
3
, is stable to the light, 

brilliant/iridescent, and has a refraction index of 1.85 [20]. It is a typical interference 

pigment showing a white pearlescent effect. Guanine is obtained from white fish scales. 

The composition is 75-97% guanine and 3-25% hypoxanthine, the ratio depends on the 

fish species [21,22]. The guanine (C5H5N5O) is a nucleic acid in particular a purine 

base. From the historical point of view guanine is first reported in 1656 by François 

Jacquin (a rosary maker from Paris) who isolated it from a fish scale suspension [22]. 

The infrared spectrum obtained from the sample is very similar to the reference 

spectrum from the literature. Assigning the absorption bands to specific vibrations is 

complex [19]. R. Pedro Lopes et al. propose that the 1672 and 1697 cm
-1

 bands (Fig. 

1c) are due to ν(C=O) coupled to the NH2 scissoring and (N1)H in-plane bending 

vibrations [19]. 

 

Finally, the protein substance determined may also be related to the fish or to the glue 

used to stick together the pigment particles.  

 

This is an example of how the identification of the materials can be obtained from an 

extremely small sample with minimal preparation and manipulation. The coating used 

in this case, guanine, is a substance which has never been described or found in art-

works and thus was wholly unexpected.

The coatings applied over the gold foils from a Baroque altarpiece of the 17
th

 century 

placed in the Cathedral Santa Maria in Tortosa, which, when the samples were 

extracted, was in process of restoration, are studied. In this period the altarpieces were 

extensively gilded [23]. The gold foil was applied over a bole (in general a red or 

yellow clay). The bole provides a certain amount of plasticity facilitating the application 

of metallic foil. Several finishings were given to obtain a specific colour and/or shine. 

In order to maximize brightness and to give the illusion of solid gold, the surface was 

polished. Sometimes, however, on certain parts of the altarpiece, a tarnish or colour 

finishing was desired and thus, it was necessary to apply a coating [24]. However, 

distinguishing among dirt deposited or a chromatic coating layer is sometimes difficult 

and at the same time very important for the adequate restoration respecting the original 

purpose. In Fig. 2a,b a thin coating layer (<2 µm)  covering the whole gold surface is 

seen. The analysis by SEM-EDS indicates the presence of Ca, Si and S. A small 

fragment of this superficial layer was mechanically separated. Three samples from 

different points were extracted avoiding the cracks (preventing contamination) and 

material from inner layers. µFTIR analysis, Fig. 2c shows characteristic absorption 

bands of substances related to environmental deposition and alteration (silicates, 

calcium carbonates, gypsum and calcium oxalates) but also to a protein-based substance 

(with absorption bands at 3300 cm
-1

 N-H stretching, ~1650 cm
-1

 C=O stretching of 

amide I, ~1540 cm
-1

 –NH2 of amide II and ~1450 cm
-1

 C-H deformation [4]). Selecting 

the areas containing a higher amount of protein, Fig. 2c, it is possible to relate it to an 

animal glue. In order to confirm this, a full chromatographic analysis would be needed.  

 

The elimination of surface dirtiness is a first step during the restoration of art-works. 

However, this example has demonstrated that it is fundamental to identify the materials 

to the latest extend, as often distinguishing between the original coatings, dirt or the 

materials related to earlier restorations is not an easy task. 

 

3.3 Beeswax from conservation treatments and wax from natural impurities of shellac 

 

Wax is another kind of material that is often found in art-works. However, beeswax has 

also been employed in conservation treatments to consolidate paint layers. Beeswax is 

naturally secreted by the intra-abdominal glands of bees (Apis mellifera L.). The 

composition of beeswax is a complex mixture including saturated hydrocarbons, esters 

and 12-14% free fatty acids [25,26]. The presence of these fatty acids is responsible for 

the presence of reaction compounds such as carboxylates produced when the waxes 

come into contact with compounds containing metals. Wax may also be found in other 

materials produced by insect secretions such as the Laccifer Lacca Kerr. This resinous 

secretion, called Seed Lac once semi-refined, contains resin, dyes and 6-7% wax. Seed 

Lac is processed separating the wax, shellac wax, from the principally resinous part, 

shellac [27,28]. However, small wax impurities can still be found in shellac, principally 

used in varnishes and coatings. 

 

From an historical restoration, a superficial treatment with beeswax is found on the 

canvas painting entitled View of the Barcelona Port, by Francesc Soler i Rovirosa 

painted in 1890 (Fig. 3). It caused a tarnishing of the paint surface. After its 

identification has recently been partly eliminated. Various samples of this coating were

analysed by µFTIR spectroscopy, obtaining different spectra showing that the layer is 

not homogeneous. After a meticulous separation the spectrum of the non-purified 

beeswax used was obtained. This kind of wax can be differentiated from the other 

natural waxes traditionally employed in artworks (purified beeswax and shellac wax) 

comparing it to the corresponding reference spectra (Fig. 3a) [29]. It has also been 

observed that it penetrated into the painting layers. 

 

The waxes (Fig. 3a, Spectrum A) can be recognized by the νC-H stretching vibrations 

of CH2 bonds giving strong and narrow bands at 2918 and 2850 cm
-1

 and a small band 

at 2956 cm
-1

 due to the CH3 group; sharp doublets at 1473 and 1463 cm
-1

, indicating 

CH2 bending vibrations; rocking vibrations at 729 and 719 cm
-1

 of methylene groups 

characteristic of a compound with a long aliphatic chain; and δC-H bending vibrations 

in the 1475-1377 cm
-1

 region of an aliphatic compound. Non-purified beeswax presents 

a νC=O stretching band at 1737 cm
-1

 and νC-O stretching band at 1176 cm
-1

 of the ester 

and the band at 1712 cm
-1

 carboxylic groups (not present in purified beeswax) and in 

addition, a progression of absorption bands from 1300 to 1200 cm
-1

, which are assigned 

to wagging and twisting vibrations of successive methylene groups coupled to a 

carboxyl group (not present in shellac wax) [29,30].  

 

The presence of beeswax on the painting was therefore confirmed although the 1712 

cm
-1

 band was unexpectedly small, a shoulder in the A spectrum of Fig. 3a. This is due, 

in part, the reaction of the beeswax fatty acids with the metals from the pigment 

particles, producing carboxylates. Zinc carboxylates are determined (bands at 1540 cm
-

1
, 1398 cm

-1
 and 1463 cm

-1
) together with copper carboxylates in smaller amounts 

(1586 cm
-1

 band) [31,32] as is shown in Fig. 3b. The zinc is obtained from the lithopone 

(BaSO4/ZnS), a filler from the chromatic layer. Additionally, the copper ions belong to 

the green pigment, copper acetoarsenite (3Cu(AsO2)2·Cu(CH3COO)2), a synthetic 

pigment used in the 19
th

 century and early 20
th

 century [33]. Calcium carbonate is also 

determined from a chalk layer mixed with different colour pigments depending on the 

area directly applied over the canvas. This layer is porous in nature and thus, easily 

incorporates substances from the relatively thin (about 30 µm) more superficial layers. 

The mixture of substances increases the complexity of the interpretation of the 

spectrum, and thus the best possible separation of materials is imperative to identify the 

several substances.  

 

Fig.4a,b corresponds to the coating applied over a silver foil on a wood moulding from 

the 15
th

 century altarpiece of Our Lady with the double intention of protecting and 

simulate gold [34]. The analysis of the coating identifies shellac containing shellac wax 

impurities. The two spectra are shown in Fig. 4c. A noteworthy difference between the 

two spectra is the shape and frequency position of the bands belonging to CH3 and CH2 

stretching vibration at 2800-3000 cm
-1

. In the shellac wax these bands are narrower due 

to the presence of numerous CH2 groups showing long aliphatic chains from the wax 

compounds, and the corresponding frequencies are slightly lower owing to this. Some 

shellac bands hide the shellac wax bands. The residue of shellac wax in this artwork 

coating demonstrates that the shellac employed was of low purity.

A separation of resins and pigments is a challenge when analysing thin layers from 

small samples taken from coatings in art-works. It is more difficult when the resin is 

mixed with drying oils following ancient recipes of varnishes and coatings. The 

presence of various materials is responsible for their reaction and the production of new 

substances which often present similar absorption bands. Detecting the presence of oil 

or studying how the different materials age is possible using the sample preparation and 

the analytical methodology proposed. The results have been corroborated and extended 

using synchrotron radiation.  

 

In order to illustrate this, a number of cases of study are shown. The first case 

corresponds to a sample extracted from a panel from the coffered ceiling of 

Paretdelgada Chapel (La Selva del Camp, Catalonia) constituted by several painted 

wooden pieces of approximately 10x30 square cm. The panel is painted in blue and red 

with a white preparation layer and finished with a varnish coating (Fig.5a). Analysis of 

the varnish shows the presence of a Pinus resin, a common component of varnish 

(Spectrum A, Fig. 5b) [35]. Additionally, small variations in the spectrum are attributed 

to the presence of calcium oxalates (1640, 1320, 790 cm
-1

) resulting from the alteration 

and/or environmental deposition (Spectrum B, Fig.5b) [36] 

 

The Pinus specie used to obtain the colophony (diterpenoic resin) is irrelevant since the 

differences between Pinus resins are determined only in fresh samples: the components 

are almost the same and there are only small differences in the relative proportions. 

During the aging process the differences between Pinus resins became gradually 

indiscernible since most of diterpene components are interconvertible to abietic acid, the 

most stable form. During the aging process, the abietic acid disproportions forming 

dehydro- and dihydroabietic acid [13,37,38]. Therefore, aged colophony has a similar 

composition whatever its origin [39].  

 

As a reference of aged colophony we took a lump of a residual secretion resin that was 

preserved in a knot of the wood identified as Pinus genus. The coffered ceiling is dated 

to the 14
th

 century, thus giving a dating to the wood and the resin. The Infrared 

spectrum from this reference resin is shown in Spectrum I of Fig.5b. From this infrared 

spectrum the intensity of the absorption band at 1606 cm
-1

 should be noted. This band 

can be assigned to the stretching C=C and related to the aging process [30,40]. This 

band becomes more intense the more aged the resin. This is evidenced in Spectrum II of 

Fig. 5b that corresponds to a 100 year old Pinus resin obtained from the Kew gardens 

collection. Moreover, it is also observed, that the 2950 cm
-1

 band corresponding to the 

νC-H stretching bands of methyl and methylene groups (2800-3000 cm
-1 

bands), gained 

intensity, when the Pinus resin was very old, A useful process of curve fitting can 

separate overlapped bands into a reasonable number of component bands (Fig. 6a,b). 

Additionally, the 1699 cm
-1

 band widens and the maximum moves to higher wave 

numbers with a new maximum of 1716 cm
-1

 due to the presence of the R2C=O group 

realted to the colophony oxidised compounds 7-oxo dehydroabietic, 7,15-dihydroxi 

dehydroabietic and 15-hydroxi-7-dehydroabietic [41]. Taking this into account, the 

infrared spectrum corresponding to the varnish of the coffered ceiling corresponds to a 

newer resin, as the 1606 cm
-1

 band, is less intense and the split of the bands previously 

cited is not very important, indicating that the varnish is not the original but was most 

probably applied at a later date.

As a final case, the characterizations of the coatings which are dark/black amber in 

colour from motifs of the polychrome decoration from the wood on the desks were 

found to be a copper resinate (Fig.7a). 

 

Besides the aging process, with copper resinates is necessary to consider also the 

reactivity among the several components and also with the environment (agents and 

pollutants). Copper resinates are produced by mixing a resin from the Pinus with a 

green copper pigment, such as the copper II acetate monohydrate [42]. This copper 

pigment shows the tendency to produce copper carboxylates from the reaction with the 

abietic acid and abietane skeleton acids, [43-45]. This can be observed in the analysis of 

the sample extracted from the decorations of a desk from the 17
th

 century (Museu del 

Disseny de Barcelona). The copper resinate is applied over a silver metal foil to 

highlight certain motifs of the decoration. Moreover, in order to assure the stability of 

these metal foils against corrosion and give it a metallic like glossy finish, these 

coatings were applied over the metallic foil. The thickness of the resin layer is 50 

micrometers.  

 

The resin layer looks like a dark material, with a brown shade. When observed under 

the optical microscope, it appears heterogeneous and in the green coloured area discrete 

green particles can be distinguished, Fig. 7b. Figure 7c shows an infrared spectrum 

recorded from a single green particle showing that it corresponds to a copper II acetate 

monohydrate, Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (called verdigris). The matrix identified as a Pinus 

resin shows a green shade and in some areas is more amber in colour with a similar 

appearance to the varnish of the last case shown. The intensity of the 1610 cm
-1

 (1612 

cm
-1

) band, more discernible in the green areas (Spectrum B in Fig.7c), is characteristic 

of antisymmetric stretching of COO
-
 group of copper carboxylates from abietic acid and 

abietane skeleton acids [30]. Thus, in the 1600 cm
-1

 region, absorption bands of these 

copper carboxylates and C=C stretching band related to the aging of the Pinus resin are 

overlapped. In this case the ~2950 cm
-1

 is not very important and indicates that the 

aging of the resin is only scarcely perceptible. However, with respect to the aged Pinus 

resin, a new band at 1400 cm
-1

 which can also be associated with symmetric stretching 

of COO
-
 group of copper abietate appears (Spectrum B in Fig.7c) [30]. The distribution 

map of these compounds can be observed in Figure 8a. The sample was prepared by 

cutting a thin layer of resin, with the use of precision cutting instruments –microknife, 

of an area that includes pigment particles visible under optical microscopy. The thin 

layer fragment was squeezed between two diamond windows, spreading the sample; 

with this method it is possible to maintain the location of the compounds. 

 

A similar case but showing some differences is observed from a sample from a early 

20
th

 century desk.  In the spectra obtained by µFTIR two maxims are observed, one at 

about 2870 cm
-1

 and another at 2856 cm
-1

. On the basis of spectral features this is 

indicative of the presence of other substances. This is shown in µSR-FTIR spectra after 

adequate curve fitting processing (Spectrum C in Fig.7c,e and Fig. 6d). Moreover, the 

weak band at 1585 cm
-1

 observed in µFTIR spectrum is related to the antisymmetric 

stretching of COO
-
 group from copper fatty carboxylate acids [5,36]. From the analysis 

carried out with µSR-FTIR, it can be concluded that copper carboxylates are formed 

from the saturated fatty acids of the drying oil. In Spectrum D in Fig. 7c-e strong and 

narrow bands at 2918 and 2850 cm
-1

 of C-H stretching vibrations of CH2 bonds, a small 

band at 2956 cm
-1

 of C-H stretching vibrations of CH3, a CH2 bending vibration band at

 10 

~1470 cm
-1

 and a weak CH2 rocking band at 721 cm
-1 

and the strong band at 1585 cm
-1 

are observed. It is important to note that, in this case fewer pigment relics remain 

(copper II acetate monohydrate) and in the area around the pigment particles, copper 

carboxylates formed by the reaction with the fatty acids are found (Fig.8b). This 

demonstrates how for carboxylates to be produced, it is necessary that the oil has 

already begun aging and thus producing free fatty acids. When this happens, the matrix 

is not very fluid and this carboxylates cannot readily diffuse. Thus in this area copper 

carboxylates formed from the fatty acids and from the abietic acid and abietane skeleton 

acids coexist. Noteworthy is the areas where copper carboxylates formed from the fatty 

acids are determined copper oxalates are also found in small quantities. Determination 

of reaction compounds allow to deduce what the original substances were which now 

are not present or cannot be detectable. 

 

All these results are in good agreement with the category of analysed objects. The Pinus 

resin was a cheap material used to varnish daily objects like furniture, household items, 

large surfaces… thus, it is reasonable to find it coating such ordinary objects like a desk 

or a coffered ceiling [24]. The fact that in some cases only the resin has been found can 

be explained by the fact that the varnish, made of resin, was dissolved in essential oil.  

During drying and aging the volatile compounds from the essential oil disappear and 

cannot be detected by µFTIR. This kind of varnish was used from the 15th century, and 

often mentioned in historical documents [2]. Oleo-resin varnish, which is a very 

common varnish, used since the 9th century (at least) and has been cited in art treatises 

and manuscripts throughout the ages [2,46]. 

 

 

4. Conclusions 

 

The varnishes, protections and coloured coatings of art-works are thin surface layers 

made up of complex materials of different nature. These surface layers often contain the 

original substances, reaction and aging products, environmental deposits or compounds 

applied in later restorations. To succeed in the analysis of these layers, the complex 

composition and the micro-layer structure must be taken into consideration. Micro 

infrared spectroscopy in transmission mode is proposed as the first step for the study of 

such layers, although the results obtained are often definitive such as in the case where 

guanine was determined. The importance of sample extraction after the object has been 

meticulously observed is highlighted in the second case shown where a protein-based 

coating to give to the nuances the brilliance of gold is determined. Additionally, it 

verified the information found in ancient treatises with regard to gilding techniques. The 

other cases shown demonstrate the range of problems that can be solved by µFTIR 

spectroscopy; i.e. discriminating substances in complex matrixes from very small 

samples and even with substances that are chemically similar. For instance the beeswax 

reaction compounds have been determined. For the discrimination of the different types 

of substances forming heterogeneous samples, a meticulous examination of the line 

shape of the spectra and band separation of highly overlapped bands are necessary. The 

importance of having aged reference material as similar as possible to the real samples 

is underlined. Furthermore, having materials differently aged is an aid in the 

interpretation of the spectra obtained. Some mathematical tools such as, distribution 

maps of specific infrared bands and curve fitting, favour the interpretation of the spectra 

and help to elucidate the various substances present in a complex sample. The improved

characteristics of µFTIR with synchrotron radiation improve the spatial resolution 

obtained which is particularly important in the analysis of heterogeneous samples. 

Moreover, it produce the high quality spectra necessary for the identification of small 

spectral features while comparing to the data obtained with conventional techniques and 

thus, provides more reliability. Finally, through the identification of individual bands it 

has been possible to comprehend the interaction processes occurring during the aging of 

Pinus resin, dying oil and green copper pigment mixtures.

Highlights 

 

- micro-FTIR approach for the study of micro samples of coatings from the art-
works  

- strategy for identification of organic, inorganic, reaction and aging compounds 
- identification of guanine (nucleic acid base) unexpected pigment in art-works 
- distribution IR maps can shed light on how reaction compounds have been 

distributed 

- interaction processes study during the aging of Pinus resin-oil-pigment mixtures
