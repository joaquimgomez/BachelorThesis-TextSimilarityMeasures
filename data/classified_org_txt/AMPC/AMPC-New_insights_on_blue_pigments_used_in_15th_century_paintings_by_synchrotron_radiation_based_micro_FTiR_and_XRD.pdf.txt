ABSTRACT 
 
The blue pigments used on altarpieces in 15th Century in Catalonia and Crown of 
Aragon are principally the azurite mineral. To a lesser extent lapis lazuli, also of mineral 
origin and occasionally, in the background areas, outlining the figures, and for the 
chromatic ground layer, indigo, were used. Data from several altarpieces belonging to 
well-known artists of the time is presented. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction 
(SR-XRD), micro-infrared spectroscopy (µ-FTIR), synchrotron radiation micro-infrared 
spectroscopy (µSR-FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with X-
ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS) are used. X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy in 
association with synchrotron radiation have shown to be especially interesting due to 
the micron spot sizes, high brilliance and energy tunability which help to obtain good 
separation of the signals coming from different phases/substances and their localization 
in the various paint layers. Examples are presented which illustrate the potential of each 
analytical technique for the identification of this kind of materials in the 15th century 
paintings. The natural origin and composition of the pigments and its distribution in the 
paint layers are determined and some correlations with other contemporary paintings 
obtained. Finally, the alteration compounds related to blue pigments are determined in 
each case. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The study of ancient paintings, and in particular Gothic altarpieces, is a challenge for 
the analytical chemists owing to the small size of the samples, the micrometric layered 
paint structure (typical layer thicknesses vary between 10 and 100 μm), the high number 
(5 or more) of different substances, low amount (in some cases a few particles dispersed 
in the layer) and diverse nature of the compounds (pigments, binders, impurities and 
aging and reaction compounds). Consequently, there is not an optimal single analytical 
technique valid for the determination of all the compounds. Additionally, the 
determination of the spatial distribution and morphology of the compounds is, often, as 
important as the chemistry and speciation of the pigment particles.  
 



Different levels of sensitivity are required to determine the main inorganic and organic 
fractions and impurities present. The identification of the impurities provides 
information not only about the pigment source and/or synthesis, but also about the 
reaction and aging compounds present, which is essential for verifying the reactivity 
and stability of the paint layers.  
 
As a consequence, a variety of analytical techniques are being used in the study of 
ancient paintings, i.e. separation techniques, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Scanning 
Electron Microscope with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), Raman 
Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), etc.1-6 
 
This paper illustrates how specific sample preparation and a tailored-combination of 
analytical techniques can solve most of the analytical problems encountered in the study 
of the blue paints in altarpieces from the 15th century. Information is obtained with 
regard to the painting techniques and the materials present, including pigments, binders, 
reaction compounds, impurities and reagents remaining in the original pigments, as well 
as on their morphology and spatial distribution. 
 
The usefulness of synchrotron radiation (SR) in the characterization of materials in 
ancient paintings has already been demonstrated in a number of studies7-9. SR allows 
focusing on areas as small as a few micrometers, obtaining spectra of very high signal 
to noise ratio thanks to the high brilliance, collimation and monochromacity of the 
beam. The combination of FTIR and XRD is particularly useful for the study of ancient 
paint layers.   
  
A typical 12-15 μm spot size may be used with mid µSR-FTIR (650-4000cm-1); the 
small spot and a specific sample preparation (pressing small fragments extracted from 
each layer in a diamond cell) permits the separation and identification of compounds 
even when present in minor amounts. The high selectiveness of the small spot analyzed 
compensates the relatively low detection limit of FTIR. Commercially available FTIR 
microscopes are only fitted with mid-IR detectors. However, many substances of 
interest such as oxides, sulphides, chlorides show IR absorption bands below 700cm-1. 
Other substances show their absorption bands overlapping with those from other 
compounds in the mid-infrared region but not in the far-infrared region. The far infrared 
region (700-200cm-1) can be reached by including a bolometer. However, in this region, 
diffraction limits the lowest spot size to about 50 μm.  
 
SR-XRD in transmission geometry with square or rectangular spot sizes as small as, 20 
μm by 50 μm, is optimal for the study of the layered structure of the paint layers. Cross 
sections of the paint samples are prepared with typical thicknesses that vary, depending 
on the stability of the material, between 100 μm and 200 μm for the Gothic paintings 
under study. The small spot has a high selectiveness, and although the sensitivity of 
XRD is not very high (between 1-5% depending on peak overlapping and crystallinity 
of the substance) the use of a small spot reduces the detection limit to low values.  
 
High resolution SR-XRD, by means of multi crystal analyzer detector system working 
in transmission geometry, is chiefly characterized by its high angular resolution. High 
angular resolution is very important to separate overlapping XRD diffraction peaks, 
usually happening in the paint layers due to the large number of contributing phases. A 
wide angular range is fundamental for the quantification of the various compounds 
present by Rietveld refinement of the data. In this case, we do not have the same high 



focusing capability, but the high angular resolution and large angular range reached can 
reduce detection limits down to 0.1 wt% for the compounds determined herewith. 
 
A combination of mid and far μSR-FTIR, μSR-XRD and high resolution SR-XRD is 
able to identify most of the compounds of interest. These tools plus SEM-EDS, which 
provides elemental composition, spatial distribution and morphology of the particles in 
the paint layers, is used in the present study for the investigation of the blue paints in the 
altarpieces. Raman spectroscopy has also been used to complement some of the 
analysis. The examples presented herewith illustrate the potential of each analytical 
technique for the analysis of this type of materials. 
 
The present study focuses on the altarpiece paintings produced in Catalonia and the 
Crown of Aragon during the 15th century. The blue samples belong to a set of artworks 
selected to include both tempera and oil techniques and the different schools from the 
territory. Following these criteria the following altarpieces have been selected: “Saint 
John and Saint Stephen” (1455-1453) by Honorat Borrassà† and “The Virgin” by Joan 
Antigó, painted with oil and egg tempera respectively both from the Girona School; 
“Constable” (1465) by Jaume Huguet and “Saint Vincent” (1455-1460) by Bernat 
Martorell belonging to the school of Barcelona both painted mainly with egg tempera 
and the altarpiece “Our Lady of the Counsellors” by Lluís Dalmau from Barcelona 
painted with oil; “The Virgin” by Pasqual Ortoneda (1459) from the school of 
Tarragona painted with a glue tempera technique; “The apparition of the Virgin to Saint 
Francis in the Porciuncula” from the Valencian school painted in a mixed technique. 
This last altarpiece and those by Honorat Borrassà and Bernat Martorell are on display 
at the MNAC (Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya) in Barcelona10; Jaume Huguet’s is 
displayed, in its original location, the chapel  of  “Santa Àgata” in the Royal Palace in 
Barcelona; Pasqual Ortoneda’s is displayed in the VINSEUM museum, in Vilafranca 
del Penedès, Barcelona. Finally, the altarpiece by Joan Antigó is displayed in its 
original location in the monastery of Saint Stephen in Banyoles, Girona. 
 
Taking into account the analysis carried out and the documents studied, the blue 
pigment used in this period and geographical area is mainly the mineral azurite, to a 
lesser extent lapis lazuli, also of mineral origin and occasionally, indigo of vegetal 
origin which was applied in the background areas, outlining the principal figures, and/or 
for the chromatic preparation layer. 
 
All the data presented in this paper have been compiled from the analysis performed 
during several years study.  
 
 
SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYTICAL METHODS  
 
Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), JEOL-5600, with 
elemental analysis (PCXA LINK EDS) are used in order to obtain information of the 
composition, size distribution and homogeneity of the particles in the paint samples. 
Small fragments or cross sections were carbon coated to ensure good electrical 
conductivity necessary to perform the SEM-EDS analysis (20kV or 25 kV of voltage 
and 1 nA of current). In order to obtain the cross sections, small fragments were 
embedded in a polyester resin polymerized by a peroxo organic catalyser in conditions 
of low humidity. After polymerization, a cut was made with a precision low speed saw 

                                                 
† Currently the MNAC attributes this work to the master of Sant Joan i Sant Esteve. 



with a diamond wafering blade (150 micron thickness), which allows precise cutting, 
and it was thinly polished with 1µm size diamond paste. Water was the only fluid used 
for lubrication and was kept to the minimum possible to avoid sample damaging. For 
sample embedding a polyester resin was chosen because it shows, considering the 
characteristic of the samples, the most adequate set of properties: the temperature does 
not increase during polymerization and has adequate hardness for cutting and polishing, 
polishing time is minimised avoiding water. Thin cuts, 100 to 200 μm thick, are also 
performed by shifting the diamond blade, these thin cuts were used to perform 
transmission μSR-XRD measurements. 
 
Synchrotron based micro X-ray diffraction (μSR-XRD) data were obtained at beamline 
BM16 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble). Small 
fragments cut from the samples were previously selected with the help of the optical 
microscope. These fragments were placed on an adhesive support from where 
measurements were taken in transmission geometry using a beam footprint of 30×30 
microns. Thin cross sections were also prepared from some selected samples –150 
microns thick. A beam footprint of about 20×50μm2 was found to be the most adequate 
for the discrimination of the compounds present in the different layers. A smaller beam 
footprint may lead to a spotty single crystal-like 2D X-ray diffraction pattern, 
dominated by only some of the big crystallites precluding the identification of the other 
compounds. A larger footprint, hampers separation of the compounds present in the 
different layers. The setup included a CCD ADSC Q210r detector and 10keV (λ=1.24 
Å) or 12.7keV (λ=0.98 Å) X-rays. This setup provides high sensitivity to compounds 
present in very low amounts and a low angular limit adequate for some of the organic 
compounds present but has some limitations in the angular resolution for highly 
overlapping diffraction patterns. 
 
High angular resolution SR-XRD measurements were also performed at beamline 
BM01 (ESRF). For these measurements, small fragments of the sample were placed in a 
glass capillary to allow spinning which improve the particle statistics. A two circle 
diffractometer with three line detectors measuring an angle of 5º was used. 
Measurements were taken in Debye-Scherrer transmission geometry at 24.9 keV (0.50 
Å). A 2θ range of 25º was recorded for a period of 15 hours. After measurements, the 
paint fragments can be taken out of the glass capillary and prepared for and used with 
other analytical techniques. 
 
Synchrotron-based micro infrared spectroscopy (µSR-FTIR) 4000-650 cm-1 range 
measurements were taken at various beamlines; MIRIAM beamline of the Diamond 
Light Source setup consists on a Bruker 80 V Fourier Transform IR Interferometer 
coupled with a Hyperion 3000 microscope, with a 100×100 micron area broad band, 
and MCT detector. SMIS beamline at Soleil Synchrotron setup includes a Thermo 
Nicolet Continuμm XL FT-IR imaging microscope with MCT detector. Far µSR-FTIR 
range measurements were performed at IR 1 beamline of ANKA synchrotron light 
source, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany. The Bruker IFS 66v/s spectrometer 
was equipped with a Bruker IRScope II microscope a bolometer for the far-infrared 
working at 4.2K for the 700-200 cm-1 interval. In all cases, in order to perform 
transmission measurements flat samples of adequate thickness (about 2 μm thick) were 
obtained by squeezing them between the two diamond windows of an anvil cell 
fragments previously cut and selected under the optical microscope. The spectra were 
obtained through only one of the windows.  Spectra were obtained in transmission mode 
and from different areas using a microbeam of either  12×12 microns or 15×15 microns 



for mid-FTIR and 50×50 microns for far-FTIR at the sample defined by the slits. For 
each measurement, 128 scans were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm-1. 
 
Raman Spectra recorded using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope, 633 nm 
excitation, 100x objective lens, with ≤1 mW power. This equipment is available at 
SMIS beamline of  Soleil synchrotron). 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSION 
 
Lapis lazuli 
 
Lluís Dalmau used lapis lazuli in the blue paint layers in the altarpiece “The Virgin of 
the Counsillors” 11. Lapis lazuli is a semiprecious stone and was an expensive pigment 
scarcely used in 15th century paintings from the Crown of Aragon. Its presence must be 
associated to the importance of an artwork that was going to be exhibited at the front of 
the Chapel of the City Hall. In fact, Lluís Dalmau was required to use blau d’Acre (lapis 
lazuli) in the terms of the contract dated October 29th, 1443. Fig. 1a,b shows the sample 
extracted from the cloak of one of the choir angels. The paint is formed by a sequence 
of layers containing particles of increasing particle size from the surface to the ground. 
The first two layers (25 µm and 65 µm thick, respectively) contain lapis lazuli particles 
and drying oil; the third layer contains coarser lapis lazuli particles mixed with some 
particles of lead white, drying oil and lead carboxylates. Below, a fourth layer (50 µm 
thick) containing coarse angular azurite -Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2- particles, lead white, drying 
oil and some lead carboxylates. The sequence of lapis lazuli/azurite layers and the 
increasing particle size is the same described for the blue clothes in the “Adoration of 
the Mystic Lamb” (exhibited in the Cathedral of Gent, Belgium) from Jan Van Eyck12, a 
Flemish panel painting with which “Our Lady of the Counsellors” shares clear stylistic 
similarities. According to historical documents Dalmau lived about five years in 
Flanders supported by the King Alfons el Magnànim, to learn about the Flemish ARS 
NOVA11. The data obtained herewith provides for the first time evidence of the direct 
link existing between Lluís Dalmau and Van Eyck’s workshop. 
 
µSR-XRD analysis of different areas of the lapis lazuli layers show the presence of 
lazurite–(Na,Ca)4-8[Al6Si6O24](SO4,S)1-2-, nepheline –Na3(Na,K)][Al4Si4O16]-, sodalite 
–Na8[Al6Si6O24]Cl2-, quartz -SiO2-, sanidine/albite –(Na,K)(Si3Al)O8- and, in some 
spots phlogopite  -K2(MgFe)6[Si6Al2O20](OH)4- is also detected, see Fig. 1c. Lazurite 
and sodalite are the minerals responsible for the blue colour while the other minerals are 
associated with the original deposits. A high resolution SR-XRD powder pattern was 
obtained from one of the fragments. This pattern was analysed by the Rietveld method 
to obtain the quantitative phase analysis. The fitting is very good as shown in Fig. 2 
(difference curve is very flat). The outpuot of the analysis is given in Table 1. The 
whole blue painting layer contains 24.6 wt% of azurite and 75.4% of minerals related to 
the lapis lazuli (see Table 1). From this analysis, it is possible to retrieve the mineral 
content of the lapis lazuli layer which contains 62.4% lazurite, 23.6% nepheline, 6.9% 
quartz, 6.1% sodalite and 1.0% sanidine, by renormalization to 100 wt%. Other 
minerals if present must be in amounts below 0.1%. Unit cell values are also reported in 
Table 1 as their values could give insight about the lapis lazuli provenance by 
comparison with data to be reported in other studies. Some of the reported phases were 
also identified by FTIR and the data are shown in Fig. 3. The occurrence of associated 
minerals indicates the natural origin of the lapis lazuli; artificial ultramarine has a 
composition similar to lazurite with uniform, small and round particles13. Moreover, the 



presence of an infrared sharp band at 2340 cm-1 and small satellite peak at 2274 cm-1 
(asymmetric stretching ν3 of 12CO2 and 13CO2 respectively) is related to CO2 adsorbed 
into the structure of sodalite and also confirms the natural origin of the lapis lazuli14-16 
(Fig. 3b). The band at 2040 cm-1 might be assigned to ν(CO) (absorbed carbon 
monoxide) and may be linked to the purification process followed17. The amount of 
sodalite (sodalite/lazurite ratio=10%) compares very well to the lapis lazuli used by 
Michelangelo in the fresco of the Last Judgment (12%)18 and could indicate the same 
geographical origin13. However, the relatively higher amounts of nepheline and quartz 
(nepheline/lazurite ratio=38%, quartz/lazurite ratio=7%) than in the pigment used by 
Michelangelo (17% and 4% respectively) may also indicate the use of a less pure 
pigment. Purification methods for removing the greyish particles from the blue pigment 
are described in contemporary paint treatises17,19.    
 
Small particles of lead white (1 µm) present in both, the azurite and lapis lazuli layers 
must have been added to benefit from the oil drying capability of the lead white. The 
formation of lead carboxylate salts from the reaction of the free fatty acids present in the 
oil with the lead white is known to trigger the drying process. The amount of lead white 
particles present is very low, actually lower than 0.1% otherwise the Rietveld 
refinement would have determined them. 
 
Finally, Lluís Dalmau mixed the lapis lazuli with drying oil, which is not most adequate 
considering that the refraction index of both lapis lazuli and oil are similar (about 1.5) 
and consequently, the scattered light is low and, accordingly is the opacity. 
 
 
Azurite 
 
Azurite is a mineral pigment20  that was widely used in 15th century wood paintings 
from the Crown of Aragon. Relevant areas of the altarpieces were painted with this 
pigment as for instance the mantel of the Virgins. Currently, these areas appear almost 
black or very dark. 
 
Fig. 4a,b OM and SEM images corresponding from a cross section of a sample taken 
from the mantel of the virgin in “Constable” altarpiece. The azurite particles can be seen 
and the environmental superficial layer deposition, perfectly integrated into the paint 
layer. 
 
The causes for this darkening can be found in the large particle size, between 2 and 30 
µm, of the pigment that was used. These particle sizes were necessary to obtain 
saturated colours as smaller sizes produce less saturated blues. The use of large particles 
creates larger interstitial gaps between them which are often not totally filled by the 
binding media. However, the amount of binding media is greater than that found in 
those painting layers obtained with lower particle size pigments also increasing the 
darkening. The darkening of the binding media is due to the aging of the organic 
compounds, in the case shown in Fig. 4, the proteins from the animal glue. The fact that 
the darkening is more evident towards the surface (Fig. 4a) suggests that this is not the 
sole cause of the colour alteration. The fact that the particle sizes at the surface are more 
irregular, favours the retention of dust and pollution deposited from the environment 
such as, carbon –from the candles and oil lamps used in the lighting-, gypsum, oxalates 
and silicates; they become integrated in the pictorial layers and even, in some cases, 
consolidated as a consequence of the subsequent application of varnish layers.  This 
makes the restoration of the original blue hues unviable. The elimination of the upper 



layers would cause the necessary loss of the pigment and as a consequence the nuances 
and motifs of the clothing.  
 
Fig. 4b, shows the presence of a white contrasted particle composed of S and Ba. These 
particles can be detected using backscattering electrons as they have a larger average 
atomic weight than the surrounding particles and organic matrix (Fig. 1b, 4b). The 
sporadic presence of these particles is commonly observed in samples containing azurite 
of mineral origin. They are barium sulphate, a material of paragenesis (mineral 
association) with azurite. This is one further indicator of the mineral origin of the 
pigment.  
 
It is also worth to notice from the analysis of several samples from altarpieces of this 
period that small amounts of malachite CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 are often identified. Malachite 
could be one of the natural impurities present in the original mineral or a weathering 
product of azurite. This last hypothesis is the most probable considering that we have 
been able to determine the presence of intermediate compounds between the structure of 
azurite and those of malachite. This can be seen in sequence of µSR-FTIR spectra 
shown in Fig. 5 21,22.  Malachite cannot be considered a compound added voluntarily to 
modify the shade of the blue pigment since the green pigment used on these altarpieces 
was a copper acetate of the type [Cu(CH3COO)2]x[Cu(OH)2]ynH2O incorporating in 
some cases a basic copper chloride [CuCl2]x[Cu(OH)2]y·nH2O. Fig. 6 shows the 
sequence of painting layers (blue over yellow and ochre layers) from a sample taken 
from the shawl of the virgin in “The apparition of the Virgin to Saint Francis in the 
Porciuncula”. The blue paint layer of the shawl (90 µm thick) is formed by coarse 
azurite particles 2CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 (10 to 20 µm) and a small amount of malachite 
CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 detected using µSR-XRD (Fig. 7). 
 
Moreover, mixed with the copper green pigments in green paints, small quantities of 
azurite were often added to reinforce the blue shade in background landscapes3. Fig. 8 
shows a series of infrared spectra from one of the green layers and also an also the 
corresponding X-ray diffraction pattern.  
 
In order to obtain less saturated blues, the pigment was also dispersed in a white matrix 
of lead white (2·PbCO3·Pb(OH)2 and PbCO3) and either egg yolk or drying oil binder; 
therefore, different shades of light blues are obtained by diluting them with a white 
pigment. Lead carboxylates resulting from the reaction of the free fatty acids from the 
binder and the lead white are also formed, Fig. 9. Azurite has little tendency to produce 
Cu carboxylates in contrast to what happens with copper acetates/basic copper acetates 
and basic copper chlorides used to obtain the green pigments1,3. 
 
Due to the transparency of azurite, the painters frequently prepared lighter or darker 
blue shades over the ground as a chromatic preparation layer. In the context of 15th 
century paintings from the Crown of Aragon, the ground layers were composed of 
gypsum and animal glue. The use of a chromatic preparation layer provided a colour 
background that highlighted the blue colour of the pigment. In most of the samples, this 
layer contained a few black carbon particles mixed with lead white, which show a blue 
shade. Raman microspectroscopy allowed us to determine the presence of these black 
carbon particles. Fig. 10 shows a series of Raman spectra corresponding to the different 
layers of a blue painting21. The presence of black carbon is detected only in the 
chromatic preparation layer. Finally, ground azurite or, in other cases, indigo mixed 
with lead white were also used to obtain a chromatic preparation layer. 
 



As we have shown in Fig. 5 we also found azurite mixed with red and white pigments to 
obtain violet and also with yellow to obtain purples. 
 
 
Indigo 
 
Indigo has long been used as a colouring agent. It can be obtained from a great variety 
of plants whose leaves contain indigo precursors such as indoxyl-β-D-glucoside 
(indican) and indoxyl-5-ketoglucomate (isatan B). These substances are soluble in water 
and, through a process of an enzymatic fermentation (β-glucosidase) and later oxidation 
with atmospheric oxygen, are transformed into a blue substance namely, indigo23-29. 
 
This substance has been used as a dye for fabrics until present, although present-day 
products are synthetic. Indigo has also been used as a pigment in paintings on 
illuminated manuscripts, boards, murals and canvas mixed with various binding media.  
 

In the 15th century, in the Western Mediterranean area, indigo could be obtained from 
the indigofera tintorea L. a plant natural from India traded through Bagdad, Venice and 
Genova (names that are sometimes associated to the pigment) or from other plants such 
as isatis tintorea L. (named Pastel in French and woad in English) cultivated in different 
European areas including some close to the Crown of Aragon, such as Languedoc, 
between Toulouse and Albi. 
 
The pigment of Asiatic origin was mixed with lime and pressed into small bricks. This 
material was not cheap but it was quite pure when separated from the lime and dried. 
However, the product most widely used by painters was that obtained from 
autochthonous plants which were more accessible, although it was obtained with lower 
purity.  
 
Indigo in this period was rarely used in the surface layers of the paintings27 and azurite 
and lapis lazuli were chiefly used. Indigo blue has been identified in the backgrounds of 
the altarpieces and in the blue painting chromatic preparation layers mixed with lead 
white. 
 
Indigo can be determined by several analytical methods such as chromatographic 
techniques, mass spectrometry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) that require 
pre-treatment of the samples.  However, its determination is more difficult when 
appearing in thin inner layers (below 10 µm) mixed with other materials (lead white, 
binding media). Fig. 11 shows its identification in a sample taken from the shawl of the 
virgin in altarpiece by Pascual Ortoneda using µ-FTIR. A good separation is needed to 
avoid overlapping bands and to obtain an unambiguous determination. 
 
Recent work by Amat et al.29 on spectroscopic properties of indigo dye assigns the 
infrared experimental bands to the functional groups and those to the theoretical 
spectrum. In our infrared spectrum from a paint layer a series of bands are identified: 
1626 cm-1 νCO, 1614 cm-1 shoulder νCC, 1585 cm-1 νCC δCH , 1483 cm-1 νCC, 1461 
cm-1 νCC, ~1400 cm-1 δNH, 1319 cm-1 νCC, 1299 cm-1 δCH, 1196 cm-1 νCC, 1172 cm-1 
δCC, 1126 cm-1 δCC, 1077 cm-1 νC-NH-C, (1037 cm-1), (876 cm-1), 754 cm-1 δCH, (748 
cm-1), 710 cm-1 γ5-ring, (696 cm-1). We may compare these bands with reference data 
from the literature25,29 and with our own reference spectra of Isatis Tinctoria L. (Blue 
Pastel from Languedoc) and Indigofera Tinctoria L. (from Mexico). We observe that 
the spectra from the Indigofera Tinctoria L. dye shows more sharp and clear bands than 



that from Isatis Tinctoria L. The IR spectrum of the paint compares better to those of 
Isatis Tinctoria L. (Fig. 11d). This could be either a reflection of the low purity of the 
material, related to the presence of carbohydrates in the raw material. The change in the 
shape of the spectrum is due to the contribution of the carbonyl and 1200-900 cm-1 
carbohydrate absorption bands. Therefore, according to the results obtained, the 
pigment used in the altarpiece “The Virgin” by Pasqual Ortoneda, the indigo was 
extracted from nearby plants. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
This article illustrates how specific sample preparation and a particular combination of 
analytical techniques can solve most of the problems that may be faced when studying 
blue paint in altarpieces from the 15th century. To obtain good µSR-XRD measurements 
in transmission thin sections, 150 microns thickness, were used. For high angular 
resolution SR-XRD measurements, small fragments of the sample were placed in a 
glass capillary to allow spinning which improve the particle statistics. With the aim of 
obtaining good µSR-FTIR spectra, measurements in transmission mode were taken 
using a diamond anvil cell. The results are based in the analyses carried over a number 
of years on a large sample selection of artworks from the period.  
 
From the study, we may conclude that lapis lazuli was used only on very precious 
artworks. In the case studied it was bound with drying oil and applied only in the most 
superficial layers of the blue paint. High resolution SR-XRD coupled with the Rietveld 
method has determined and quantified the minerals constituting the lapis lazuli used, 
which may come from the same source area than those used by Michelangelo. FTIR 
analysis has shown the presence of absorbed CO2, which highlights the natural origin of 
the material. The application of a several layers with a decreasing particle size, first 
azurite and finishing with lapis lazuli relates it to Jan van Eyck’s “Adoration of the 
Mystic Lamb” with whom shares also clear stylistic resemblances. 
 
Darkening of the azurite painted blue areas is related to the large size of the pigment 
particles that increase the porosity of the paint where dust from the environment is 
trapped. This dirt can hardly be removed and is been often consolidated with subsequent 
varnish layers. Among azurite particles, a few and small BaSO4 particles, an associated 
mineral, can also be detected. Due to the weathering of azurite, small quantities of 
malachite are formed. Aged azurite does not tend to form copper carboxylates in 
contrast to other copper pigments such as acetates. 
 
Indigo blue was used in large background and chromatic preparation areas. The pigment 
used in this period and area was principally obtained from plants found in nearby areas 
(Isatis Tintorea L.).
