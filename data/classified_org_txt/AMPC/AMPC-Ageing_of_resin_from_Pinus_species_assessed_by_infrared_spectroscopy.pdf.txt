Abstract 
 

Resins obtained from Pinus genus species have been widely used in very different fields 

throughout history. As soon as they are secreted molecular changes start altering their 

chemical, mechanical and optical properties. The ageing processes are complex and chemical 

and structural changes associated to resin degradation are not yet fully known. Many 

questions still remain open, for instance changes happening in pimaranes, one of the two 

diterpenoid constituents of the resin.   

A systematic study of the ageing process of Pinus resins is done through of Fourier Transform 

Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) using chemical standards and complementing obtained results 

with Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis when necessary. 

Moreover, long-term degradation processes are also investigated through the analysis of a 

selection of dated historical resins. The study overcomes the limitations of GC/MS and brings 

new information about the reactions and interactions between molecules during Pinus resin 

ageing process, providing information about bonds affected and unaffected and can be used as 

specific markers of the degradation and of the resins themselves.

Introduction 
The Pinus genus belongs to the Pinaceae family; this genus includes many species, mainly 

trees, found mostly in the north hemisphere [1]. One of the features of Pinus species is that 

they exudate a resinous secretion, known as rosin or colophony, which has chemical and 

physical properties adequate for many uses: printing inks, varnishes, adhesives, soaps, food 

additives… [2-4]. The first molecular changes can be observed after a few weeks after 

collecting the resin, consequently the identification of the oxidative pathways and how they 



2 
 

affect the chemical composition is essential for the correct identification of the material, its 

degree degradation and to determine of the long-term resin degradation process.  

Previous GC/MS analyses of Pinus resins have shown that fresh resin contains mainly two kinds 

of diterpenoid structures: abietanes and pimaranes. Abietic, palustric, laevopimaric and 

neoabietic acids are some of the unoxidized abietanes present in fresh resin, which tend to 

isomerize producing abietic acid. In atmospheric conditions, abietic acid evolves into more 

oxidized molecules [5-9], the most oxidized molecule determined so far being 15-hydroxy-7-

oxodehydroabietic acid [10,11]. Although pimaranes are more stable, some studies also 

revealed their diminution during ageing [6, 12]. This reduction has sometimes been related to 

the pimaranes polymerization; however, the resulting polymer has not yet been identified, 

leaving the pimaranes ageing paths unsolved. 

Spectroscopic studies performed to date including Pyrolysis coupled to GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) 

[14-18], Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy [19-25] and Raman Spectroscopy [26-

29] among other techniques [30] have been focused on the identification of the Pinus resin by 

determining its characteristic footprints. Nevertheless, a spectroscopic study of the ageing 

process is expected to give very valuable additional information since, unlike GC/MS, it can 

detect macromolecules and it doesn’t require any sample treatment such as dissolving or 

derivatization, to identify how molecular species are organized and which reactions or 

interactions exist among them. One of the properties of FTIR spectroscopy is the low 

sensitivity and the difficult interpretation if the sample is mixed with any other material: 

working with a FTIR coupled to a microscope (µFTIR) and using a good sample preparation 

method can help to obtain good data which makes interpretation easier. 

The aim of this research is to follow by FTIR spectroscopy the compositional changes, reactions 

and interactions between molecules occurring during natural ageing process of Pinus resins. As 

the verification of specific molecules is a crucial step, this research includes the study of 

chemical standards of the main compounds and complementary analysis with GC/MS 

following the analytical methods successfully used in literature [5-12].  

Initially, chemical standards of the main components of Pinus resin have been analysed and 

band assignments have been proposed. Next, the first steps of natural ageing in both fresh 

resin and abietic acid itself (chief compound of Pinus resins) are monitored by FTIR, identifying 

the spectral features related to the process. Finally, long-term degraded samples have been 

studied, and for this having well-dated aged resins is essential. Old Pinus resins samples may 

be obtained from archaeological and artistic objects as it was a cheap easily found material all 

over Europe [32,33] and consequently widely used. Pinus resins can be found in varnishes and 

protective coatings (furniture, weapons…) applied over daily objects and artworks [34,35], also 

as adhesives to fill gaps and consolidate panels [36,37].  

Materials and methods 
Chemical reagents 

Abietic, dehydroabietic and isopimaric acids were purchased from Sigma A

by GC/MS. 15-hydroxy-7-oxodehydroabietic acid was purchased from Chemfaces (ref. 

CFN97533).  

Methanol from Sigma Aldrich (ref. 3460) and MethPrepII from Grace (ref. 18007) were used in 

the reactivity tests and chromatographic analysis. Acetic acid from Panreac (ref. 131008.1611) 

was used for acidification. 

Fresh resins samples 

The genus and species from all the natural resins studied were certified; subspecies and 

variants were not considered. Fresh resins were collected directly from the tree; resins of Pinus 

canariensis C.Sm. ex DC. and Pinus sylvestris L. were collected in March 2014 at Jardi Botànic 

de Barcelona, resins of Pinus halepensis Mill. and Pinus pinea L. in the coast of Tarragona 

(Catalonia). The resins were applied in thin film while the resin was still viscous and then were 

naturally aged for 16 months (from March 2014 to July 2015). One sample of each kind was 

aged in the open air (temperature range between 10 and 270C) but protected from direct 

sunlight and meteorological inclemency (wind, rain…) and the other was aged in a dark closed 

cupboard (temperature range between 20 to 250C). 

Aged resin samples 

Some aged resins were supplied by “Economic Botany Collection of the Royal Botanic Gardens, 

Kew”, Richmond (Greater London, UK): Pinus nigra (ref. 28172, resin from Cyprus displayed at 

the Forestry Exhibition in Edinburgh, 1884), Pinus halepensis (ref. 79882, resin sold in the 

market in Syria, 2007) and Pinus sylvestris (ref. 28417, dated between 1850 and 1900). Other 

samples were extracted from the varnish of the 16th century canvas entitled “Comte Borrell” 

by Filippo Ariosto and from the knot of the wooden frame of the panel no. 173 from the ceiling 

of Santa Maria de Paretdelgada Chapel (Selva de Mar, Catalonia) dated from the 14th century. 

Instrumental 

FTIR measurements were taken in transmission mode using a Shimadzu IRAffinity−1 

spectrometer with an AIM-8800 microscope and a MCT detector. Micro-fragments of the 

materials were squeezed into a diamond anvil cell to ensure the adequate thickness for 

analysis. The measurement conditions were: 4000–700 cm−1 interval, 4 cm−1 resolution, 256 

scans and a 100×100 square micrometer spot. At least three spectra were measured and 

compared to each other to ensure the reproducibility of the data. All spectra shown are raw, 

neither baseline correction nor smooth procedures were applied to the spectra. 

GC/MS analyses were performed with an Agilent Chromatograph (6850 model and HP-5MS 

column) coupled to an Agilent Mass Spectrometer (model 5975C). The samples were dissolved 

in 20 µl of methanol, derivatized with 15µl of MethPrepII and heated at 66.6oC for 2 hours. 

Splitless injection was used with a non-linear heating ramp from 60 to 300oC; the spectrometer 

temperature was fixed at 300oC. Molecules were identified through comparison with the NIST 

database. 

All figures have been generated with Grapher Golden Software (version 11.4.770).

Tests 

The esterification of Fig. 5 was done by adding an excess of MethPrepII and heating at 66.6oC 

for 2 hours. The acidification was done by adding an excess of acetic acid and heating for 2 

hours, then it was left uncovered until the acid evaporated, about 1 hour. 

The hydrolysis of acid anhydrides performed in Fig. 8 was done by adding an excess of water 

and heating for three hours, then it was left uncovered until water was evaporated, about 1 

hour [38]. 

Results and discussion 
Reference materials 

The correct assignment of the Pinus resin infrared bands is fundamental for any further study. 

Consequently, abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid, 15-hydroxy-7-oxodehydroabietic acid and 

isopimaric acid were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and specific characteristic markers of the 

molecular structures were identified and band assignments proposed. 

The IR spectrum corresponding to the abietic acid is shown in Fig. 1a. The bands at 3200 cm-1, 

2648 and 2534 cm-1 correspond to the group –COOH; the former to free OH (not the main one) 

and the last two to bonded OH, the most common since in solid state the carboxylic groups 

tend to form dimers [39]. These last bands appear overlapped with overtones and combination 

bands of lower-frequency vibrations from the COOH group which also appears around 1550 

[40]. The C-H stretching absorption bands nearby 2900 cm-1 also show a complex shape due to 

the presence of =CH, –CH3, –CH2 and –CH groups, where the –CH2 bands appear split due to 

the presence of conjugated C=C bonds [41]. The narrow band at 1693 cm−1 belongs mostly to 

the stretching of C=O, but it also shows a shoulder at 1626 cm−1 and an overlapped band at 

~1670 cm−1 related to the presence of conjugated C=C bonds. Finally, in the region under 1500 

cm−1 a great number of bands are observed. The most intense at 1280 cm−1 corresponds to the 

C-O deformation from the –COOH group and the peak at 891 cm-1 is related to the C-H 

deformation out of plane of conjugated double bonds. [39, 41-45] 

The infrared spectrum corresponding to dehydroabietic acid (Fig. 1b) is similar to those of 

abietic acid although it shows some minor differences (Fig. 1b). The band at about 3000 cm-1 

corresponds to C-H stretching, but unlike abietic  acid, the –CH2 bands appear un-split because 

the conjugated C=C bonds are now related to the aromatic group, which doesn’t split the –CH2 

bands. As in abietic acid, the bands around 3200 and 2600 cm−1 correspond to O-H stretching, 

overtones and combined bands. The 1695 cm−1 band corresponds to the C=O stretching 

belonging to –COOH group. Below 1500 cm-1, the band at 1498 cm-1 corresponds to the =C-H 

stretching of the aromatic groups and the band at 819 cm-1 to the out of plane deformation of 

the aromatic C-H group. Finally, the band at 891 cm-1 is not present as it is related to 

conjugated double bonds. [41, 45,46]. 

The 15-hydroxy-7-oxodehydroabietic acid is the most oxidized compound determined in aged 

resins so far. Its infrared spectrum (Fig. 1c) shows differences depending on how the –OH 

groups are bonded to [41,45]. This is clearly seen by comparing the spectrum corresponding to 



5 
 

the commercial compound (Fig. 1c, black line) with the one obtained from the dried acid after 

dissolving it in methanol (Fig. 1c, grey line). The narrow band at 3532 cm-1 corresponds to free 

–OH groups; this band is more intense in the commercial compound but a new broad band 

around 3400 cm-1 corresponding to –OH groups with intermolecular bonds appears in the 

treated acid. Differences in the –OH structure also affect the 1700 cm-1 and 1200 cm-1 regions. 

The 1700 cm-1 band appears broader in the treated compound due to the presence of 

hydrogen bonds between hydroxyls and carboxylic acid groups. Owing to the intermolecular 

bonds created in the treated acid the 1271 cm-1 band decreases while the 1242 cm-1 band rises 

(non-bonded and bonded C-O stretching). Consequently, the detection of this molecule is 

problematic since different bands related with –OH are to be expected in its spectrum 

depending on the molecules to which it bonds; nevertheless, here it is proposed the rise of the 

~3400 (O-H stretching of bonded hydroxyl group) and ~1245 cm−1 (C-O deformation of bonded 

hydroxyl group) bands (Fig. 1c) as a markers of its presence. [41,45] 

Finally, the spectrum corresponding to the isopimaric acid (Fig. 1d) is similar to those of the 

abietic and dehydroabietic acids. A complex band at about 3000 cm−1 consequence of the 

variable environment of the –CH3, –CH2 and –CH groups is observed. Moreover, the 

characteristic O-H stretching, overtones and combination bands at 3200 and 1600 cm−1 are 

also present. The functional group characteristic of the pimaranes is the =CH2 with bands at 

1824 cm−1 (overtone of =CH2) and 910 cm−1 (C-H deformation out of the plane). [41,45] 

Fresh materials 

Fresh Pinus resin is made mainly of non-oxidized abietanes and a smaller portion of pimaranes 

the exact amount of each varying depending on the specie [47-53]. This can be observed in the 

infrared spectra displayed in Fig. 2: different specie resins show variations mainly in the 

intensities of the bands directly related to the precise amount of each compound present. 

The main compound is abietic acid in all the cases (Fig. 2, red and black lines), due to the fast 

conversion of non-oxidized abietanes (palustric acid, neoabietic acid, laevopimaric acid…) to 

abietic acid in the resin. However, some differences between abietic acid and fresh resins 

spectra can be appreciated. The C-H stretching absorption band shows the largest differences. 

The higher intensity of the C-H stretching absorption band at ~2930 cm−1 in some fresh resins 

can be explained by the higher proportion of the –CH2 groups compared to those of pure 

abietic acid. The un-split bands corresponding to the symmetric C-H stretching is due to the 

lower proportion of C=C bonds (absent in the pimaranes) in the resins. There are also some 

other additional bands in the fresh resins spectra due to the presence of other compounds in 

minor amounts. From this, it can be seen that 1182 and 1020 cm−1 bands can be found in all 

fresh resins spectra, so they can probably be related with common compounds. Band at 1182 

cm−1 is proposed as a marker for non-oxidized abietanes or volatile compounds ((CH3)2-CH-CH 

stretching) because in this frequency range we can find of that functional group [41,45] and, as 

shown in the next section, it disappears during ageing. On the other hand, 1020 cm−1 band is 

proposed as a pimarane marker (CH2=CH wagging) as in this frequency range we can find that 

functional group [41,45] and this band remains during ageing.  

Ageing changes 



6 
 

Fig. 3 shows the changes happening in fresh Pinus halepensis Mill. resin samples aged in open 

air and indirect daylight. The most important and significant changes occur in the 1695 and 

~1245 cm−1 bands; the latter associated with 15-hydroxy-7-oxo-dehydroabietic acid as 

indicated before and the former associated to the C=O stretching group. Although the peak 

position and intensity of the 1695 cm−1 band is not affected by ageing (both non-oxidized and 

oxidized -COOH species are present in the resin), it broadens due to the presence of a shoulder 

at 1725 cm−1 probably related to the C=O stretching of the ketone group of the 7-

oxodehydroabietic and 15-hydroxy-7-oxo-dehydroabietic acids. The presence of the ~1610 and 

~1500 cm−1 bands related to the aromatic groups agrees with the identification of those acids. 

Additionally, the broadening of the 1696 cm−1 band may also be related to the presence of 

hydrogen bonds from the –OH and –COOH groups and to a minor contribution from oxalates. 

Finally, the increase in the 1245 cm−1 band hides the presence of other bands related to the 

resin such as the 1280 cm−1 band. 

Other changes observed are the broadening of the bands around 2650 and 2530 cm−1 which 

are explained by the increase in the chemical variability around the -COOH groups. The regions 

1200-1100 and 1050-800 cm−1 where skeletal vibrations appear, show an increased absorption 

which also can be related the formation of other types of molecules due to ageing.  

Abietic acid was also aged similarly to study the oxidative process without the interference of 

pimaranes and the corresponding IR spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The initial processes fully 

agree with those of Pinus resin and, consequently, it can be concluded that the main changes 

observed in the Pinus resin spectra correspond to the oxidation of abietic acid. 

As the –COOH and –OH band assignments are fundamental for this study, some chemical 

treatments were performed to a sample of naturally aged (3 months) Pinus pinea L. resin (Fig. 

5a) in order to verify them. The first treatment consisted in the derivatization of the resin using 

MethPrepII to transform the –COOH groups into –COOCH3 (Fig 5b). It can be seen that bands 

related to –COOH groups decrease (O-H stretching at ~3200 and ~2600 cm−1, C=O stretching at 

1695 cm−1 and C-O deformation at 1280 cm−1) and some bands related to the –COOCH3, like 

the C=O stretching at 1724 cm−1, appear. The second treatment consisted in an acidification 

with acetic acid followed by a derivatization with MethPrepII to convert the –COOH groups 

into –COOCH3 and the –OH groups into –OCH3. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 5c: It can be seen 

that bands related to –COOH and –OH groups (O-H stretching at ~3400 cm−1 and C-O 

deformation at 1250 cm−1 from –OH) decrease and also the bands related to the –COOCH3 and 

–OCH3 appear. 

Fig. 6 shows the IR spectra corresponding to the Pinus pinea L. and Pinus halepensis Mill. resins 

before and after the first ageing stages (16 months), both in darkness and open-air conditions. 

The small differences observed among the various fresh species can hardly be appreciated in 

the aged resins. This was not wholly unexpected as all abietanes evolve into the same oxidized 

form. The samples aged under different conditions (darkness and open-air) also show similar 

results. However, comparing the bands corresponding to the oxidized abietanes (3400, 1725, 

1606, 1500 and 1245 cm−1) for an equivalent ageing period, the samples kept in a dark 

environment appear less oxidized than those aged in open-air conditions. Consequently, open 



7 
 

air accelerates the degradation process but the identified compounds are the same (at least 

the ones which can be detected by FTIR analysis). 

It is also important to notice that the changes observed during natural ageing differ from those 

observed in artificial photo ageing [54].  

Ancient resins 

To identify the changes at advanced degradation stages we have to rely on the study of well 

dated ancient resins. However, the degradation degree depends not only on age but also on 

the storage environmental conditions, as it can be seen in Fig. 6 and in the literature [55,56].  

In order to verify the chemical composition and in particular the presence of oxidized 

compounds, the resins were first analyzed by GC/MS.  

According to GC/MS data (Fig. 7), the older resins show the higher concentration of oxidized 

compounds, i.e. a more advanced degradation. In the FTIR spectra, the bands related to the 

hydroxyl, ketone and aromatics groups which can be found only in the oxidized compounds 

(Fig. 7) increase. The bands associated to the hydroxyl groups appears at ~3400 cm−1 (O-H 

stretching) and ~1245 cm−1 (O-H deformation); those related to the ketones appears at ~1725 

cm−1 (C=O stretching). Finally, those related to the aromatic C=C stretching appears at 1606, 

1514 and 1496 cm−1 (the latter probably belonging to dehydroabietic acid). All these changes 

are also observed in other aged Pinus resin IR spectra found in the literature [54,57-59]. 

Nevertheless, the increased absorption observed between 1740 and 1800 cm−1 and also at 

about 1155 cm−1 (Fig. 7e) cannot be linked to the presence of a functional group of any related 

molecule. Here it is proposed that these bands be assigned to the acid anhydride groups 

formed by the reaction of two carboxylic acid groups from different molecules (abietanes or 

pimaranes), as they agree with the frequency range described for this group (C-O-C and C-C-O 

stretching) [41,45]. To confirm this hypothesis a treatment which consists in hydrolyzing the 

acid anhydride bonds was performed (experimental details have been explained in previous 

section): results are in Fig. 8. The GC/MS analysis (Fig 8a) shows that after the hydrolysis there 

is a higher concentration of pimaranes and other oxidized compounds, which can be explained 

because they were originally linked by acid anhydride bonds so they could not be detected by 

GC/MS in the first analysis. In the same way in FTIR spectra (Fig. 8b) the shoulder between 

1740 and 1780 cm−1 can be observed before hydrolysis decreases: this could be explained 

because the acid anhydride bonds have been hydrolyzed so the related bands have 

diminished. The formation of acid anhydride bonds could also explain why pimaranes were not 

detected in aged samples by GC/MS. It also agrees with the results obtained by Size Exclusion 

Chromatography showing the presence of high molecular weight compounds in aged resins 

[57]. 

Finally, even in the most degraded materials the O-H stretching band at ~3400 cm−1 increases 

and the 1245 band is still present (Fig. 7). This suggests that there is no evidence of the 

reaction reported by other studies [60] between the hydroxyl group from 15-hydroxy-7-oxo-

dehydroabietic acid and a carboxylic acid group from other molecules to form esters, so if they 

are formed are in such a low quantity that it is not possible to detect them by FTIR analysis.

A summary of the processes happening during ageing is shown in Fig. 9 where specific IR 

markers for the identification of the various compounds produced during the degradation 

stages are also proposed.  

Conclusions 
A systematic study of the natural ageing of some Pinus resins and related compounds was 

performed by FTIR. The oxidative processes and molecular changes were identified giving the 

possibility of obtaining information about them in unknown samples. However, the limitations 

of FTIR technique must be kept in mind, namely the low sensitivity and the interpretation 

problems that arise when the spectra obtained have impurities and bands cannot be properly 

identified.    

Results confirm the initial transformation of abietic acid into dehydroabietic acid and then into 

more oxidized species. At advanced stages of the transformation, reactions and interactions 

among molecules take place. On the one hand, the hydroxyl group of the 15-hydroxy-7-oxo-

dehydroabietic acid stablishes intermolecular bonds. On the other hand, the reaction between 

two carboxylic acid groups from different molecules (abietanes or pimaranes) gives rise to the 

formation of acid anhydrides. This can explain in a more reliable way the decrease of the 

amount of pimaranes at the late stages of ageing than the polymerization between them. 

Moreover, no evidences have been found to confirm other reactions which have also been 

proposed, such as the esters formation. 

Resins of the various species evolve into a similar molecular composition (oxidized abietanes 

and high molecular weight compounds). Different ageing conditions (open air and darkness) 

give the same results although at a different rate. Thus, it is difficult to establish a direct 

relationship between the age and the degradation of a sample. 

IR bands related to the different stages of the transformation have been identified. The 

determination of both resins markers and degradation degree markers are essential since the 

identification of the resins is hampered by the degradation mechanisms happening from their 

exudation. 

Finally, as abietanes can be found in other Pinaceae species, like Larix decidua Mill. or Abies 

alba Mill., these results can also be relevant for their study.

Fig. 2 Comparison between the infrared spectra of abietic acid (red line) and various fresh 

Pinus resins (black line); I: Pinus canariensis C.Sm. ex DC., II: Pinus sylvestris L., III: Pinus pinea 

L., IV: Pinus halepensis Mill.. An enlargement of the 1500-700 cm-1 region is shown at the right. 

Marked in green the wavenumbers proposed for the identification of abietanes and in blue for 

the pimaranes.  The molecules corresponding to some of the abietanes (a: neoabietic acid, b: 

laevopimaric acid, c: palustric acid) and pimaranes (d: sandaracopimaric acid, e: isopimaric 

acid) are shown at the left.
