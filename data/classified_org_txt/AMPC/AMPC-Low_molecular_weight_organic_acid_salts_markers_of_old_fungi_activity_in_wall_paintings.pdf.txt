Abstract 

Micro Infrared Spectroscopy (µSR-FTIR) and X-Ray diffraction (µSR-XRD) with 

synchrotron light, Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (CG/MS), Optical 

Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM/EDS) were used to identify 

and obtain the distribution of complex mixtures of calcium salts of low molecular 

weight organic acids (LMWOA) in micro-layered micro-samples. Filamentous fungi 

produce LMWOA that can react with metal cations producing stable salts. These 

substances were found in the dark spots covering the surfaces of Saint Michael’s 

Chapel wall paintings of the Royal Monastery of Pedralbes in Barcelona linking them to 

old fungi activity. The presence of glycerol likewise related to the fungi activity is also 

identified in the layers.  

 

1. Introduction 

Fungi attacks are a frequent problem in paintings and, generally speaking, are not 

easily diagnosed as very often the fungi are not any longer active 
1-5

. Fungi develop 

from spores transported by the air which, if the humidity and temperature are 

favourable to their growth, germinate on the walls surface. Fungi are rarely tied to a

specific substratum and the same species can be found on surfaces as different as wall 

paintings or leather 
2
. The most common types of the fungi found on wall paintings in 

either the warmest or most temperate climates are, among others, Aspergillus, 

Penicillium, Cladosporium and Alternaria 
2,3

. During their period of activity fungi 

produce a large variety of secretion substances which react with the environment or 

the paintings producing other compounds. If the atmospheric conditions are 

unfavourable to the fungi development, they die and all the substances resulting from 

the bioactivity also decompose and disappear remaining only those which are more 

stable. In the case of ancient wall paintings the fungi activity could have taken place a 

long time ago, even centuries ago, but still the most stable reaction products are likely 

to be found. 

 

Among other substances fungi produce organic acids of low molecular weight 

(LMWOA) such as lactic, citric, oxalic, succinic, glutamic, fumaric, malic or acetic acids, 

mostly related to the reactions happening in the Krebs cycle 
1,2

. Some of these acids or 

the corresponding salts produced by their reaction with metal cations are relatively 

stable. Calcium oxalates, for example, are found on many surfaces, although their 

origin is diverse and, consequently, they cannot be considered as an indicator of fungi 

activity. On the contrary, the presence of salts from malic, fumaric or succinic acids is 

directly related to the existence of old fungi activity.  

 

The dark spots covering the surfaces of wall paintings were presumed to be the 

remnants of old fungi activity, as the distribution did not show any relationship with 

the substratum. The pictorial decorations of Saint Michael’s Chapel studied are 

situated in the cloister of the Royal Monastery of Pedralbes in Barcelona
6
 and were 

carried out in 1346 (Fig. 1). They have been long attributed to the painter Ferrer Bassa, 

to whom, according the documentation, was commissioned the work by the abbess of 

the monastery. The paintings are in a good state of conservation although some 

alterations are evidenced. The paintings are currently being restored
7
, and the present 

study is part of a comprehensive program of Restoration. The study of the chemical 

nature of the dark spots is essential to design a plan for restoration that is effective as 

well as respectful for the pictorial layers.  

 

The small thickness of the layers formed by the fungi activity (between 10-15 

micrometres thick), the small amount of sample material available for analysis, as well 

as, the variable proportions in which the fungi related compounds are present in the 

layers, strongly difficult and limit their identification. Moreover, the various degrees of 

hydration of the crystals and the potential possibility of mixed salts formation also add 

to the difficulty of their identification. Finally, other materials such as silicates, gypsum, 

calcium carbonate and other organic materials either from environmental pollution 

(dust) or from the burning of candles are also often deposited on the surfaces and 

appearing in the layers. 

 

Samples extracted from the paintings were analysed by means of Optical Microscopy 

(OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM/EDS), Micro Infrared Spectroscopy (µSR-

FTIR) and Micro X-Ray diffraction (µSR-XRD) with synchrotron light and Gas 

chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The combination of these analytical

techniques can overcome the analytical challenge and provide essential information 

about the old fungi activity leading to a better understanding of the relationship 

between fungi and the paint substratum. Infrared spectroscopy was used as a first step 

in the identification of the nature of those substances and the LMWOA anions were 

determined using the whole of a sample using GC-MS. Their distribution in the layers 

was resolved using the micro-analytical techniques
8,9

. Synchrotron radiation (SR) 

thanks to the high brilliance, energy selection and collimation of the beam enables 

obtaining spectra with a very high signal to noise ratio on areas as small as a few 

micrometres. In particular, the high selectiveness of the small spot analysed 

compensates the relatively low detection limit of FT-IR (about 10% of the measured 

area) and the relatively low sensitivity of XRD (between 1-5% depending on peak 

overlapping), helping to determine compounds present in extremely small amounts 

from a few microgram samples. This aspect becomes particularly important for 

fragments taken from an artwork. It is worth to highlight that the new generation of 

portable XRD and IR equipment might facilitate sampling the artworks, either 

identifying original materials or the kind of alterations under study, thanks to their 

non-destructiveness. However, they will hardly be a substitutive of SR based micro-

analytical techniques as they cannot produce the high quality data necessary. 

Laboratory based micro-analytical techniques although showing a great potential in 

cultural heritage studies, often, either are not able to collimate the beam down to the 

spot size adequate (FTIR) or the brilliancy of the beam is not high enough to obtain the 

data quality required to determine the compounds (XRD).  

 

 

2. Materials and methods 

 

Synthesis of calcium salts: The synthesis of the LWMOA calcium salts was produced by 

stoichiometrically mixing the necessary amount of acid and calcium hydroxide or 

calcium carbonate with water, homogenized and afterwards dried by evaporation of 

the water at 25
o
C. Reagents: DL-Malic (COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH), Fumaric 

(HO2CCH=CHCO2H) and Succinic (HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH) acids were purchased from 

TCI; Lactic acid (H3C-CH(OH)-COOH), calcium carbonate CaCO3 and calcium hydroxide 

Ca(OH)2 were purchased from Panreac; Calcium Lactate pentahydrate Ca(H3C-CH(OH)-

COO)2·5H2O and calcium oxide CaO were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 

 

Optical Microscopy (OM): Microsamples were manipulated under a Stereomicroscope, 

SMZ800 Nikon. Fragments, sections and thin slices were observed with an Optical 

microscope Eclipse LV100 Nikon. Polished cross sections and thin preparations were 

prepared embedding the samples in epoxy resin and subsequent microtoming. For 

some samples, and with the aim of avoiding the contamination of the most superficial 

layers, they were previously coated with a thin gold protecting layer before embedding 

them in epoxy resin.

µSR-FTIR measurements were taken at beamline MIRIAM B22 of the Diamond Light 

Source, UK
10

. The Bruker 80 V Fourier Transform IR Interferometer is equipped with 

Hyperion 3000 microscope, a broad-band high sensitive MCT detector and a 36x 

condenser. The spectra were obtained in transmission mode using a small beam spot 

of 15x15 square microns, 4 cm
-1 

resolution, co-adding 256 scan at scanner velocity 80 

kHz (35 sec), in the 4000 to 650 cm
-1

 wavenumber range. IR maps of the molecular 

composition were obtained by scanning the sample via a micrometric resolution 

motorized X-Y stage. Selected sample fragments were squeezed between two 

diamonds into an anvil cell to obtain samples of adequate thickness and to spread and 

separate the different substances. 

 

FTIR spectra of reference salts were measured with a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1, 4 cm
-1

 

resolution, 128 scans, in the 4000 to 400 cm
-1

 wavenumber range. The analysis was 

performed using KBr pellets (13 mm diameter). 

 

X ray diffraction: Synchrotron based micro-X-ray diffraction patterns (µSR-XRD) were 
obtained from samples extracted from the artworks at beamline XALOC of the ALBA 

Synchrotron, Cerdanyola del Vallès (Barcelona). 20 μm thick microtomed cross sections 

of the samples were measured with a focused beam of 50x6μm
2
 (FWHM), 1s 

acquisition time and 12.6 keV energy in a virtually noise free Pilatus 6M (Dectris) 

detector with a large (424x435 mm
2
, 6 Mpixels) active area

11
. The diffraction patterns 

from all the layers were obtained by scanning the sample over ca. 150 μm with a step 

of 6 μm.  

 

Scanning Electron Microscope: Fragments, sections and thin slices were observed by 

means of a GEMINI SEM equipment with a Shottky-FE column at 4pA-20 nA, 0.1 to 30 

kV and 1nm resolution for 20KV. Elemental analysis was made with an EDS with an 

INCAR Penta FETX3 detector and a 30 mm
2
 ATW2 window.  

 
Gas chromatography /mass spectrometry: GC-MS, 5975C Series GC/MSD System - 

Agilent Technologies, Agilent 6850, column HP-5MS. The samples were dissolved in an 

excess of derivatization reagent (50 µl de BSTFA) heated up to 70
o
C for 3 hours. 

Working conditions were splitless injection and a nonlineal heating rate from 40 to 

300
o
C. The identification of the molecules was made comparing with a NIST 2 

database. 

 

3. Results and discussion 

Small dark spots (occupying a surface of few millimetres in size) randomly distributed 

on some areas of the wall paintings are observed. At the beginning of this study their 

nature was not clear, so their chemistry had to be determined to assert their origin 

and to obtain information about their composition necessary for an adequate 

restoration (removal). The spots were present all over the paintings indistinctly of the 

nature of the substratum, appearing over different colour paints and materials, but 

being more visible in the lighter tones. In this study samples from different areas of the 

paintings with different base colours were analysed.

In the areas affected, alongside the dark spots, crystal growths of an ochre colour are 

sporadically observed. A blue coloured area affected by those grows is shown in Fig. 2 

and 3. The crystal growths (Fig. 2a) contain a large proportion of calcium oxalates as 

well as a residual presence of protein and carbohydrate (Fig. 2b). Moreover, up to 100 

µm long and ~1,5 µm wide filaments containing carbohydrate are also sporadically 

observed. Both the crystal growths and the filaments are most probably related to old 

filamentous fungi
12-14

. The spots appear shiny and show a smooth surface (Fig. 3a). 

SEM-EDS analyses of the dark spots reveal the presence of calcium as the only metal 

element present.  

This old fungi activity is responsible for the presence of fungi secretions substances 

that still persist as well as, of the corresponding reaction compounds of those 

secretions. Although, the identification of the nature of the substances is essential, it is 

even more important to determine the degree of affectation of the painting and, 

consequently, confirm their presence in the most internal layers of the paint. For this 

reason, cross sections of the samples were prepared and the different paint layers 

analysed. Fig. 3b,c,d show the cross section corresponding to a blue paint. The 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image from the cross section of the sample (Fig. 

3c) shows the presence of a layer formed by large (5-10µm) very characteristic blue 

pigment particles of azurite, 2CuCO3·Cu(OH)2. The most external surface of the paint 

layer shows a continuous thin brownish film covering (10 and 15 µm thick) the 

irregular shape of particles which contains only one metallic element, calcium (Fig. 3d). 

 

A fragment of the same blue painting was squashed and the various paint layers (see 

Fig.4a) spread on a diamond cell keeping the layered structure as shown in Fig.4b. The 

thickness of the layers is such that may be analysed in transmission mode by infrared 

spectroscopy. The corresponding μSR-FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. 4c. The inner 

black layer contains calcium carbonate and calcium oxalates (carbon, the most likely 

black pigment, cannot be detected by infrared spectroscopy). The spectrum of the blue 

layer confirms the presence of azurite particles seen in the SEM image (Fig.3c). Finally, 

the spectra corresponding to the most external brownish layer are very similar and 

suggest a homogeneous mixture of calcium salts of low molecular weight organic acids 

(LMWOA salts). The IR spectra of those substances show characteristic main bands of 

organic salts, namely the asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibrations of the 

deprotonated carboxylate groups and the stretching and bending bands from the νOH 

group. Stretching and bending of C-H groups can also be observed but with a low 

intensity due to their low molar absorptivity. 

In order to confirm the family of substances as well as the anions present, a fragment 

of the paintings was subjected to Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). 

In particular, succinic, fumaric, malic and lactic acids are determined which are known 

to be secreted in variable proportions by various fungi species
15,16

. Moreover, among 

them, glycerol was also determined; glycerol can be produced by some species of fungi 

when stressed by water shortage
2
.   

It is also very important to notice that these calcium LMWOA salts are determined by 

μSR-FTIR only in the most external brownish (Fig. 4); in contrast, the calcium oxalates

are present also in the internal layers, as is shown in Fig. 5. Oxalates are known to form 

by the degradation of the binding medium (protein binder). The painting technique 

used in these wall paintings combines fresco (calcium carbonate binder) with secco 

(which involves the addition of an organic binder) and, consequently, the calcium 

oxalates present in the inner paint layers could result from the degradation of the 

organic binder. 

Noteworthy, some of these LMWOA salts formed are crystalline enough to be 

determined by x-ray diffraction (µSR-XRD), Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows the µSR-XRD pattern 

from the layer related to old fungi activity, which was detached from a blue paint 

layer. In this case, two different crystalline LMWOA salts are determined, confirming 

the presence of more than one LMWOA salts in the brown spots. One of them could 

be identified as calcium malate dihydrate (JPDF file 00-030-1575)
17

. The second 

compound could not be related to any of the patterns found either in the literature or 

among those sintered by us.  

Moreover, the μSR-XRD patterns corresponding to a microtomed cross section of one 

sample extracted from an ochre paint are shown in Fig. 6b. Two layers are observed; 

the ochre paint below and a most external layer containing the substances related to 

old fungi activity on top. The ochre paint is essentially a clay containing goethite -

FeO(OH)- , quartz –SiO2-, calcite –CaCO3-, weddellite –calcium oxalate dehydrate, 

CaC2O4·2H2O- and bassanite –calcium sulphate hydrate, CaSO4·0.5H2O- which has 

broad peaks and, consequently, low crystallinity, also in good agreement with the 

composition of an ochre clay, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, sulphur, potassium, 

calcium and iron. The µSR-XRD pattern corresponding to the most external layer shows 

the same unknown crystalline compound found in the blue paint and some calcite; this 

is in good agreement with the fact that calcium, together with some chlorine related to 

atmospheric contamination is the main compound determined by SEM-EDS analysis 

(Fig.6c).  

The small thickness of the microtomed cross section of the samples together with the 

small size and high brilliance of the beam have been crucial to obtain distinct µSR-XRD 

patterns of the crystallites related to the fungi activity considering the low intensity of 

the diffraction patterns of the salts and the small thickness of the layers formed. 

Both infrared spectra and x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from different samples 

corresponding to different substrata and painting colours show how these substances 

are present in various proportions in all the dark spots. The fact that the infrared 

spectra and XRD patterns obtained do not coincide exactly with the reference data 

available in the literature
17-19

 or with the LMWOA salts sintered by us (Fig. 7), may be 

explained by the extreme complexity of the layers found in the paintings: mixed 

LMWOA salts showing different degrees of hydration and which are also present in 

various proportions. Fig. 8. The salts identified correspond to calcium salts of the 

monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids where the anions act as monodentate, 

bidentate or tridentate ligands
20,21

. Moreover, their stability and crystallinity depend 

also on the presence of hydration water
22

. Oxalate, malate, lactate, succinate, 

fumarate can show various degrees of hydration (polihydrated salts) with different 

crystalline growth habits or even also often amorphous halos. For this reasons, an

extensive database of low molecular weight organic acid salts is being elaborated in 

order to identify, in the near future, the specific chemical species.  

Despite this lack of complete information, a tentative interpretation of the complex 

infrared spectra (Fig. 8) is proposed. The 3800-2500 cm
-1

 region of the infrared spectra 

of the compounds identified in the paint samples is shown in Fig. 8b. This region 

includes many bands (some overlapping each other) corresponding to (O-H) stretching 

vibrations of –OH groups which may be found in many different ways. The alcohol 

groups show bands at   ̴3600 cm
-1

  for the free –OH, at   ̴3550 cm
-1

  for the 

intramolecular bonded –OH, at 3400-3200 cm
-1

 for the intermolecular –OH bonds and 

below 3200 cm
-1

 for the chelated groups. Carboxylic groups show bands between 

3560-3500 cm
-1

 for the free –OH groups and between 2700-2500 for the bonded –OH 

groups. Finally, in this region, hydrogen bonds related to vibrations from both, 

hydroxyl groups and water molecules (crystallization water in the salts can form strong 

hydrogen bonds) are also seen
23,24

. The 1800-600 cm
-1

 region of the infrared spectra is 

shown in Fig. 8c. The 1630 cm
-1

 band is difficult to assign, as although it could be 

assigned to the alkenyl C=C stretching found in the fumarate salt it is also present in 

the succinate salt reference spectrum (Fig 7) related to the δ(O-H) bending mode of 

H2O 
20

. C=O asymmetric stretching vibration bands of the carboxylate group (carboxylic 

acid salt) are found in the interval between 1550 and 1600 cm
-1

. The bands observed 

at 1427 or 1440 cm
-1 

can be associated to the C-O symmetric stretching vibration of 

the carboxylate group
11

, but also to the δCH2 mode of methylene group
18,25

 (a small 

contribution due to the presence of carbonate, calcium carbonate, cannot be fully 

withdrawn). The bands observed at 1391 and 1409 cm
-1 

can be related to the CH3 

asymmetric bending vibration (present in the lactate salt), but also to the C-O 

symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylate group
18,25

. The band observed 

between 1340 and 1350 cm
-1 

can be associated to the wagging of the CH2 methylene 

group or to the CH3 symmetric bending vibration (present in the lactate salt). The 

sharp bands at 1051 and 1103 cm
-1

 might be related to the C-O- stretching of the 

primary and secondary alcohols, respectively.  However, at 1051 cm
-1

 a band is also 

found in the calcium malate reference spectrum although calcium malate does not 

contain primary alcohols. The bands observed at 892 or 813 cm

 can be attributed to 

the rocking and wagging modes of water molecules. And finally the band centred at 

690 cm
-1

 can be related to the calcium oxygen, νM-O, stretching vibration; although it 

also overlaps with other bands such as the δ(OCO) band.  

A high quality spectrum is required to discriminate the presence of the LMWOA salts 

from other compounds. For instance, Fig. 9 shows how a green earth pigment, such as 

celadonite (3602, 3558, 3535 cm
-1

) 
26-28

 showing bands in the νOH region very close to 

those corresponding to the salts from secreted organic acids, may disturb the correct 

identification of the LMWOA salts. This example highlights the need of high quality 

infrared spectra to discriminate those substances in the paint samples; something that 

requires a particularly accurate preparation and manipulation of the samples.  

One of the most remarkable characteristics of those layers related to old fungi activity 

is that water rinsing of the dark spots is able to remove completely the brownish-

yellowish substance associated to the crystallites which became afterwards 

translucent colourless. The resulting colourless crystals are the salts of low molecular 

weight organic acids analysed so far. Furthermore, the analysis of the brown residue 

extracted shows, apart from the presence of calcium carbonate and carbohydrates 

dragged in the water cleaning process, a water soluble dark brown pigment with 

absorption bands at ~3400, 2930, ~1590, ~1390 cm
-1

 which may be related to a 

melanin pigment
29

. Melanins are blackish brown pigments present in animals, plants, 

bacteria and fungi to protect them mainly from the UV radiation. In fungi, melanin is 

an important protective factor against the adverse effects of environmental stress, 

such as UV radiation, drying periods or presence of high concentrations of salts. In 

general, the chemical structure of melanins is still not completely understood because 

they are complex polymers of amorphous nature. Most groups of melanins are water 

insoluble. A exception are pyomelanins (included in the allomelanin group), which are 

water soluble and may be secreted by filamentous fungi
29,30

.  

The dark brown colour of the spots heavily affects the appearance and readability of 

the paintings, but their removal can only be obtained using specific chemicals which 

may also affect the integrity and stability of the paintings. The translucent colourless 

LMWOA salts left after removal of the brown pigment are relatively invisible and 

therefore, affect in a very limited form the appearance of the paintings. Therefore, and 

considering that the removal of the brown colourant substance is very simple and 

undamaging, it is advisable to proceed by removing it but leaving the LMWOA salts. 

 

4. Conclusions 

Calcium LMWOA salts have been determined in the dark spots localised on the surface 

of 14
th

 century wall paintings. In particular, calcium salts of the oxalic, malic, lactic, 

succinic and fumaric acids. Those salts are directly related to the reaction compounds 

of the acids secreted by fungi and the environment depositional calcium compounds. 

Those substances appear forming a thin, 10-15 µm thick, superficial layer and show 

little interaction and low penetration within the painting layers.  

Both infrared spectra and x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from different samples 

corresponding to different substrata show that those fungi layers contain various 

proportions of salts showing different degrees of hydration and crystalline growth 

habits.  

In the context of paintings conservation, revealing the nature of those substances that 

form the dark spots has pointed out the difficulty of fully eliminating them without 

affecting the paint layers. The dark colour shown by those affected areas is, however, 

not due to the presence of these substances itself but to the presence of a brown 

colourant (possibly melanine secreted by the fungi), which is water soluble, and 

therefore, can be easily removed but leaving the colourless translucent LMWOA salts 

which do not affect the readability of the paintings. This treatment has been 

successfully applied in the restoration of the Saint Michael’s chapel wall paintings.    

Finally, the data obtained in this study has given enough analytical information about 

those substances to be able to determine their presence in other artworks using
